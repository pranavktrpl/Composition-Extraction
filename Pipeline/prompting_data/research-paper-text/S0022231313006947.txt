Title:
Synthesis  structural  optical  electrical and thermoluminescence properties of chemically deposited PbS thin films

Abstract:
PbS thin films with deposition times of 100, 115, 130 and 145min were prepared by chemical bath deposition method at room temperature. Their crystal structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction. All films were polycrystalline with a cubic rock salt structure. The morphological properties of the films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The optical properties of the films were studied using the absorbance, transmittance and reflectance spectra. The optical band gap of the films decreased from 2.65eV to 2.50eV with increasing deposition time. The optical parameters of the materials such as refractive index, extinction coefficient and dielectric constants were also determined. The electrical conductivity of the PbS film increased from 1.791×10−6 to 1.655×10−3 (Ωcm)−1 with increasing deposition time. Thermoluminescence intensity of the films was measured after irradiating the films with a β source for 15min at room temperature and the kinetic parameters were obtained by using the computer glow curve deconvolution method.

Introduction:
PbS thin films, as one of the most important IV–VI group semiconductors, have attracted considerable attention in recent years as low-toxicity and cost-effective materials for use in solar cell fabrication. Moreover, these films have been the subject of considerable research due to their technological importance in crystalline and polycrystalline forms as gas sensors [1], infrared radiation detectors [2,3] and solar cells [4,5]. PbS thin films usually exhibit a p-type conduction, and their direct band gap can be varied in a wide range, up to 2.3eV, from the bulk value of 0.41eV. It is very important to vary morphological, optical and electrical properties of PbS thin films by adjusting the grain size using different deposition techniques, such as successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) [6], atomic layer deposition (ALD) [7], electro-deposition [8] and chemical bath deposition (CBD) [9]. The CBD method is one of the important techniques which can be performed using a range of precursors and synthesis conditions such as low temperature, deposition time, concentration, reactant pH. The optimization of these parameters leads to nanoparticles with different size [10] and shapes exhibiting different structural, optical and electrical properties.
There have been many attempts to understand structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of PbS thin films. However, the thermoluminescence (TL) method, which is widely used for the investigation of the charge carrier traps in materials, has not been applied for these films, yet. Moreover, size effects on the luminescence properties of PbS films remain an open research area.
In the present work, PbS thin films with different deposition times were prepared by CBD technique at room temperature. The structural, morphological, optical, electrical and thermoluminescence properties of the prepared PbS films were studied. TL properties of the PbS films were investigated after irradiating the films with beta source (D≈0.04Gy/s) for 15min at room temperature. The trap parameters were determined by the computer glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) method from the TL glow curves.

Experimental Details:
2.1 Synthesis of the PbS thin films The PbS thin films were deposited on four glass substrates immersed in different beakers with the same solutions. Each solution was prepared in a 100ml beaker by the sequential addition of 5ml 0.5M (PbCH3COOH)·2H2O, 5ml 2M NaOH, 6ml 1M NH2CSNH2 and 4ml 0.5M C6H5Na3O7. The sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and tri-sodium citrate (TSC), (C6H5Na3O7) were used as complexing reagents. A total volume of 100ml was obtained by adding deionized water to the solution. Four types of films labeled y1, y2, y3 and y4 were prepared at room temperature for 100, 115, 130 and 145min, respectively. The colors of the obtained PbS thin films changed from light grey to dark grey with increasing deposition time. The reactions of the PbS formation on the glass substrate are given as [11] (1) Pb ( CH 3 COO ) 2 ⋅ 2 H 2 O + TSC ⇌ [ Pb ( TSC ) ] 2 + + 2 ( CH 3 COO − ) (2) [ Pb ( TSC ) ] 2 + ⇌ Pb 2 + + TSC (3) [ ( H 2 N ) 2 CS ] + OH − → CH 2 N 2 + H 2 O + HS − (4) HS − + OH − ⇌ H 2 O + S 2 − (5) Pb 2 + + S 2 − → PbS
2.2 Characterization The structure of PbS films was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), in the range of diffraction angle 20°≤2θ≤70° using a 0.02° with 40kV at 40mA, CuK α (1.54056Å) radiation using a Rigaku RadB diffractometer. The optical band gap of the films was evaluated using the absorption data recorded on a Perkin Elmer UV/VIS Lambda 2S spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 300–1100nm using a non-coated glass as the reference beam. Hall measurements were performed by a HS-3000 Manual Ver 3.5 system, using Van der Pauw geometry, at a constant magnetic field of 0.54T. The thickness and the surface morphology of the films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM Philips 30XL SFEG, Nederland). The thicknesses of the films were also determined by the weight difference method (WDM) assuming the sample is uniform and dense as having a bulk density of 7.597gcm−3. The glow curves of the PbS films were measured using a Harshaw QS 3500 manual type TL Reader that is interfaced to a PC where all glow curves are analyzed. Glow curve read out was carried out on a platinum planchet at a linear heating rate of 1C/s. A continuous flux of nitrogen was used during the TL readouts to reduce chemiluminescence in the heated films. All films were irradiated using the same experimental setup of the β-source at room temperature.

Synthesis Of The Pbs Thin Films:
The PbS thin films were deposited on four glass substrates immersed in different beakers with the same solutions. Each solution was prepared in a 100ml beaker by the sequential addition of 5ml 0.5M (PbCH3COOH)·2H2O, 5ml 2M NaOH, 6ml 1M NH2CSNH2 and 4ml 0.5M C6H5Na3O7. The sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and tri-sodium citrate (TSC), (C6H5Na3O7) were used as complexing reagents. A total volume of 100ml was obtained by adding deionized water to the solution. Four types of films labeled y1, y2, y3 and y4 were prepared at room temperature for 100, 115, 130 and 145min, respectively. The colors of the obtained PbS thin films changed from light grey to dark grey with increasing deposition time. The reactions of the PbS formation on the glass substrate are given as [11] (1) Pb ( CH 3 COO ) 2 ⋅ 2 H 2 O + TSC ⇌ [ Pb ( TSC ) ] 2 + + 2 ( CH 3 COO − ) (2) [ Pb ( TSC ) ] 2 + ⇌ Pb 2 + + TSC (3) [ ( H 2 N ) 2 CS ] + OH − → CH 2 N 2 + H 2 O + HS − (4) HS − + OH − ⇌ H 2 O + S 2 − (5) Pb 2 + + S 2 − → PbS

Characterization:
The structure of PbS films was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), in the range of diffraction angle 20°≤2θ≤70° using a 0.02° with 40kV at 40mA, CuK α (1.54056Å) radiation using a Rigaku RadB diffractometer. The optical band gap of the films was evaluated using the absorption data recorded on a Perkin Elmer UV/VIS Lambda 2S spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 300–1100nm using a non-coated glass as the reference beam. Hall measurements were performed by a HS-3000 Manual Ver 3.5 system, using Van der Pauw geometry, at a constant magnetic field of 0.54T. The thickness and the surface morphology of the films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM Philips 30XL SFEG, Nederland). The thicknesses of the films were also determined by the weight difference method (WDM) assuming the sample is uniform and dense as having a bulk density of 7.597gcm−3. The glow curves of the PbS films were measured using a Harshaw QS 3500 manual type TL Reader that is interfaced to a PC where all glow curves are analyzed. Glow curve read out was carried out on a platinum planchet at a linear heating rate of 1C/s. A continuous flux of nitrogen was used during the TL readouts to reduce chemiluminescence in the heated films. All films were irradiated using the same experimental setup of the β-source at room temperature.

Results And Discussion:
3.1 Structural studies The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the PbS films with different deposition times are shown in Fig. 1. It is clear from this figure that there are four diffraction peaks, which are indexed as cubic rock salt (NaCl)-type structure, as confirmed using a Standard PDF card (PDF card no: 05-0592). These peaks correspond to (111), (200), (220) and (311) lattice planes. As seen from Fig. 1, all obtained films generally exhibit poor crystalline structure because of a broad peak in the 2θ range of 20–40°. The growth mechanism of PbS film can be explained with three competing processes: homogenous deposition, heterogeneous precipitation and ion-by-ion growth. In homogenous deposition, the films have a poor crystalline structure, because they are formed by the adsorption of PbS particles and not by ion–ion deposition [12]. If the film is annealed in a nitrogen medium, a well crystallized PbS film could be obtained. A comparison of the observed XRD results for the PbS films with the standard values are given in Table 1. The lattice parameters of all films were calculated using the (111) plane and d value (inter-planar spacing) for the cubic structure, which is given by [13] (6) 1 d 2=h 2 + k 2 + l 2 a 2 where (hkl) are the Miller indices of the plane concerned and a is the lattice parameter. The calculated lattice parameters for the PbS films have been listed in Table 1, which is in good agreement with the reported values [11] and the standard value of the lattice parameter taken from the PDF card (a=5.9362Å). The surface morphology of PbS thin films was observed through SEM image analysis (35000× and 100000× magnifications) and these micrographs are given in Fig. 2. SEM micrographs with 35000× magnification indicate that average grain size in the obtained PbS films, in which spherical-like PbS nanoparticles are observed, increases approximately from 60nm to 217nm with increasing deposition time, as presented in Table 2. It can be noticed that all films visualized at 100000× magnification have randomly grown islands with different size and shapes, whose distributions on the surface are almost uniform. Among the islands, sparsely distributed hollow sites can be observed. Increasing deposition time results in a decrease in the size of the islands, whereas the hollow sites get smaller and sparser. Thus, denser and more homogeneous films could be produced by increasing deposition time. Fig. 3 shows the SEM micrograph for cross-sectional morphology of PbS films. It is seen from the figure and Table 2 that the film thickness increases from approximately 93 to 110nm with increasing deposition time. Besides, smaller film thicknesses are obtained from SEM micrographs than the ones calculated through the WDM method.
3.2 Optical studies The UV/VIS transmission and reflectance spectra of the PbS films are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). It is seen from Fig. 4(a) that the transparency of the deposited film decreased from 29.26% to 16.46% at a wavelength of 600nm with increasing deposition time. The optical absorption coefficient (α) for the films was calculated using the following equation [14]: (7) T=( 1 − R ) 2 exp ( α t ) , where T is the transmittance, R is the reflectance and t is the film thickness. The variation of the optical absorption coefficient with wavelength was analyzed to find out the nature of the electronic transition across the optical band gap. The nature of the transition was determined using the relation: (8) α h ν=B ( h ν − E g ) n , where B is a constant, h is Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency of photon and n is equal to 1/2 for direct band gaps [15]. The band gap (E g ) can be obtained by extrapolating the straight line of (αhν)2 vs. hν curve to intercept the horizontal hν axis. The calculated band gap of the films is shown in Fig. 5 and listed in Table 2. From the figure and table, it can be seen that the direct band gap of the sample decreased from 2.65eV to 2.50eV with increasing deposition time. Such high values can be attributed to quantum confinement effect [16,17] due to the small grain size of the polycrystalline film, and are consistent with the literature values of the PbS thin films grown by chemical bath deposition (CBD) process at room temperature on corning glass and Si(100) substrates, with the variation of polyethylene glycol (PEG300) amount in the solution [18–21]. The properties of nanocrystalline materials change from their corresponding bulk properties, because the sizes of the crystallites become comparable to the Bohr excitonic radius. The refractive index distribution of a dielectric medium strongly influences the propagation of an optical wave front through micro-optical elements such as microlens, a gradient index (GRIN) lens, and a fiber lens. Knowledge of the refractive index profile of transparent or semi-transparent optical elements is very important, not only in characterizing the phase transformation and aberrations associated with focusing or imaging properties, but also in controlling the optical quality of the elements. Optical constants, such as the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) were calculated by using T and R spectra of the film. The complex refractive index for any solid material can be expressed as (9) n ⁎ ( λ )=n ( λ ) + i k ( λ ) . The n and k values were calculated using following equations [22]: (10) k=α λ 4 π , (11) n=1 + R 1 − R + 4 R ( 1 − R ) 2 − k 2 . The spectral curves of n and k are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). Both n and k values decrease with increasing wavelength. These indicate that the thin films absorb light in the studied region. The increase in the refractive index is associated with the fundamental band gap absorption. It is seen from this figure that both the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) increased from 2.92 to 3.63 and 0.23 to 0.35 with increasing deposition time at the wavelength of 600nm, respectively (Table 2). It can be seen that the calculated refractive index values are higher than those obtained in [23], and lower than the results reported earlier [9,24,25]. As also confirmed by the SEM images, the formation of denser films with increasing deposition time may be the cause of the increase in refractive indices of the films as given in Table 2. Moreover, the calculated ones for the extinction coefficient are higher than the corresponding reported values [24,14]. It is well known that the polarizability of any solid is proportional to its dielectric constant. The real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric constant are calculated using the following equations [26]: (12) ε 1=n 2 – k 2 , (13) ε 2=2 n k , where ε 1 is the real part and ε 2 is the imaginary part of the dielectric constant. The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant were calculated by using n and k values from Eqs. (12) and (13). The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant are shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d). As seen, obtained values for the real part are higher than those for the imaginary part. ε 1 and ε 2 parts of the dielectric constant increase from 8.46 to 13.08 and 1.37 to 2.58 with increasing deposition time at 600nm wavelength, respectively (Table 2). These values are in good agreement with those in Refs. [24,25].
3.3 Electrical studies Hall measurement results in Table 3 show the mobility, carrier concentration, resistivity and conductivity values of the PbS films with different deposition times. The obtained values for the Hall coefficients show that all films are of p-type conductivity. The carrier concentration and mobility of the film increased from 5.334×1012 to 5.307×1014 (cm−3) and 1.331 to 5.087 (cm2 V−1 s−1) with increasing deposition time, respectively. The presented values for the mobility of the films are higher than the reported values [27–30]. As seen, the electrical resistivity for the PbS films decreased from 5.583×105 Ωcm to 6.041×102 Ωcm while the electrical conductivity of the films increased from 1.791×10−6 (Ωcm)−1 to 1.655×10−3 (Ωcm)−1 with increasing deposition time, Table 3. The measured values for the electrical conductivity of the present films are higher than the value reported by Thangaraju et al. [31], in which PbS thin films were deposited by spray pyrolysis technique and the conductivity was determined as 10−5 (Ωcm)−1, and Gadave et al. [32], in which PbS films were fabricated by CBD and the conductivity was found as 10−5–10−6 (Ωcm)−1. The dependence of the electrical conductivity of the PbS films on film thickness is shown in Fig. 7. As seen, electrical conductivity of the films increases with increasing film thickness. Grain boundary scattering of free electrons in thicker films is less than in thinner films because of larger crystallite sizes. Since the conductivity (σ) is inversely proportional to the electron scattering frequency, γ ( σ=N e e 2 / m e ⁎ γ ) , the conductivity increases with increasing film thickness [33].
3.4 Thermoluminescence studies Thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) is the phenomenon of the light emission during warming a previously irradiated substance with uniform heating rate. When a material is exposed to ionized radiation such as α, β, γ, X-rays and UV-rays or undergoes certain chemical reactions or mechanical stress, a certain percentage of the liberated charge carriers (electron and holes) may be trapped at certain imperfections in the lattice. A dosimetric research of a thermoluminescent material is based on a virtue knowledge of its kinetic parameters which quantitatively describes the trapping–emitting centers principal for the thermoluminescence emission. There are particular techniques to evaluate the trapping parameters such as the activation energy (E a ), the pre-exponential factor (s) and the order of kinetics (b) from TL glow curves [34,35]. It should be noted that although photoluminescence properties of the PbS films were reported [36], the TL properties of chemical bath deposited PbS films with different deposition times have not been studied, yet. Thus, the TL properties of the PbS films (y1, y2, y3 and y4) are systematically investigated in this work. TL glow curves for the PbS films are shown in Fig. 8. The recorded glow curves of the films were analyzed using the CGCD method. This method has great advantages due to a simultaneous determination of kinetic parameters for all peaks without additional thermal treatments and experimental repetitions in comparison with other experimental methods. Also, this method uses all data points in the whole glow curve, rather than just a few points during the curve fitting procedures. It can be clearly understood from Ref. [37] that we need many data points to make a reliable prediction of the kinetic parameters. The CGCD program used here which is based on the least square minimization procedure was developed at the Reactor Institute at Delft, Netherlands. The results obtained by this method are available in Ref. [38]. The deconvoluted glow curves of the films are given in Fig. 9 and the related kinetic parameters are presented in Table 4. The reliability of the fitting procedure for glow curves was tested using the figure of merit (FOM) [39]. As seen, all the films have a main glow peak (called P3) at 200°C. The calculated activation energies of the films are very close to each other. However, y1 has the highest activation energy, intensity and a simpler glow curve structure in comparison with others. These properties make y1 a good candidate for TL. When the PbS films are grown on a glass substrate by CBD method, the glass matrix and the PbS thin film composition is formed. The thickness and crystallite size of the films increase with the deposition time. In the present study, the film thickness was found in the range of 1095–1181nm. It is well known that within the nanometer region, the materials show different properties from that of their bulk materials. In thin films, the number of ions on the surface quickly increases as the crystallite size decreases. While the PbS films are irradiated by ionizing source, the electron–hole pairs are generated within the films by excitation of electron from the valence band to conduction band. The excited electrons and holes from the surface ions are easily trapped at the surface states. The trapped carriers at the surface states are released by heating the sample and they recombine with each other and give out thermoluminescence. The number of surface ions and surface states increase with decreasing crystallite size due to the increase of the ratio of the surface to volume. TL efficiency increases since the number of trapped charged particles at the surface state increases [40]. Therefore, it can be said that TL of the PbS films may be related to the surface states and y1 exhibits the highest TL intensity.

Structural Studies:
The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the PbS films with different deposition times are shown in Fig. 1. It is clear from this figure that there are four diffraction peaks, which are indexed as cubic rock salt (NaCl)-type structure, as confirmed using a Standard PDF card (PDF card no: 05-0592). These peaks correspond to (111), (200), (220) and (311) lattice planes. As seen from Fig. 1, all obtained films generally exhibit poor crystalline structure because of a broad peak in the 2θ range of 20–40°. The growth mechanism of PbS film can be explained with three competing processes: homogenous deposition, heterogeneous precipitation and ion-by-ion growth. In homogenous deposition, the films have a poor crystalline structure, because they are formed by the adsorption of PbS particles and not by ion–ion deposition [12]. If the film is annealed in a nitrogen medium, a well crystallized PbS film could be obtained. A comparison of the observed XRD results for the PbS films with the standard values are given in Table 1.
The lattice parameters of all films were calculated using the (111) plane and d value (inter-planar spacing) for the cubic structure, which is given by [13] (6) 1 d 2=h 2 + k 2 + l 2 a 2 where (hkl) are the Miller indices of the plane concerned and a is the lattice parameter. The calculated lattice parameters for the PbS films have been listed in Table 1, which is in good agreement with the reported values [11] and the standard value of the lattice parameter taken from the PDF card (a=5.9362Å).
The surface morphology of PbS thin films was observed through SEM image analysis (35000× and 100000× magnifications) and these micrographs are given in Fig. 2. SEM micrographs with 35000× magnification indicate that average grain size in the obtained PbS films, in which spherical-like PbS nanoparticles are observed, increases approximately from 60nm to 217nm with increasing deposition time, as presented in Table 2. It can be noticed that all films visualized at 100000× magnification have randomly grown islands with different size and shapes, whose distributions on the surface are almost uniform. Among the islands, sparsely distributed hollow sites can be observed. Increasing deposition time results in a decrease in the size of the islands, whereas the hollow sites get smaller and sparser. Thus, denser and more homogeneous films could be produced by increasing deposition time.
Fig. 3 shows the SEM micrograph for cross-sectional morphology of PbS films. It is seen from the figure and Table 2 that the film thickness increases from approximately 93 to 110nm with increasing deposition time. Besides, smaller film thicknesses are obtained from SEM micrographs than the ones calculated through the WDM method.

Optical Studies:
The UV/VIS transmission and reflectance spectra of the PbS films are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). It is seen from Fig. 4(a) that the transparency of the deposited film decreased from 29.26% to 16.46% at a wavelength of 600nm with increasing deposition time. The optical absorption coefficient (α) for the films was calculated using the following equation [14]: (7) T=( 1 − R ) 2 exp ( α t ) , where T is the transmittance, R is the reflectance and t is the film thickness. The variation of the optical absorption coefficient with wavelength was analyzed to find out the nature of the electronic transition across the optical band gap. The nature of the transition was determined using the relation: (8) α h ν=B ( h ν − E g ) n , where B is a constant, h is Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency of photon and n is equal to 1/2 for direct band gaps [15]. The band gap (E g ) can be obtained by extrapolating the straight line of (αhν)2 vs. hν curve to intercept the horizontal hν axis. The calculated band gap of the films is shown in Fig. 5 and listed in Table 2. From the figure and table, it can be seen that the direct band gap of the sample decreased from 2.65eV to 2.50eV with increasing deposition time. Such high values can be attributed to quantum confinement effect [16,17] due to the small grain size of the polycrystalline film, and are consistent with the literature values of the PbS thin films grown by chemical bath deposition (CBD) process at room temperature on corning glass and Si(100) substrates, with the variation of polyethylene glycol (PEG300) amount in the solution [18–21]. The properties of nanocrystalline materials change from their corresponding bulk properties, because the sizes of the crystallites become comparable to the Bohr excitonic radius.
The refractive index distribution of a dielectric medium strongly influences the propagation of an optical wave front through micro-optical elements such as microlens, a gradient index (GRIN) lens, and a fiber lens. Knowledge of the refractive index profile of transparent or semi-transparent optical elements is very important, not only in characterizing the phase transformation and aberrations associated with focusing or imaging properties, but also in controlling the optical quality of the elements. Optical constants, such as the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) were calculated by using T and R spectra of the film. The complex refractive index for any solid material can be expressed as (9) n ⁎ ( λ )=n ( λ ) + i k ( λ ) .
The n and k values were calculated using following equations [22]: (10) k=α λ 4 π , (11) n=1 + R 1 − R + 4 R ( 1 − R ) 2 − k 2 .
The spectral curves of n and k are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). Both n and k values decrease with increasing wavelength. These indicate that the thin films absorb light in the studied region. The increase in the refractive index is associated with the fundamental band gap absorption. It is seen from this figure that both the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) increased from 2.92 to 3.63 and 0.23 to 0.35 with increasing deposition time at the wavelength of 600nm, respectively (Table 2). It can be seen that the calculated refractive index values are higher than those obtained in [23], and lower than the results reported earlier [9,24,25]. As also confirmed by the SEM images, the formation of denser films with increasing deposition time may be the cause of the increase in refractive indices of the films as given in Table 2. Moreover, the calculated ones for the extinction coefficient are higher than the corresponding reported values [24,14].
It is well known that the polarizability of any solid is proportional to its dielectric constant. The real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric constant are calculated using the following equations [26]: (12) ε 1=n 2 – k 2 , (13) ε 2=2 n k , where ε 1 is the real part and ε 2 is the imaginary part of the dielectric constant. The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant were calculated by using n and k values from Eqs. (12) and (13). The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant are shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d). As seen, obtained values for the real part are higher than those for the imaginary part. ε 1 and ε 2 parts of the dielectric constant increase from 8.46 to 13.08 and 1.37 to 2.58 with increasing deposition time at 600nm wavelength, respectively (Table 2). These values are in good agreement with those in Refs. [24,25].

Electrical Studies:
Hall measurement results in Table 3 show the mobility, carrier concentration, resistivity and conductivity values of the PbS films with different deposition times. The obtained values for the Hall coefficients show that all films are of p-type conductivity. The carrier concentration and mobility of the film increased from 5.334×1012 to 5.307×1014 (cm−3) and 1.331 to 5.087 (cm2 V−1 s−1) with increasing deposition time, respectively. The presented values for the mobility of the films are higher than the reported values [27–30]. As seen, the electrical resistivity for the PbS films decreased from 5.583×105 Ωcm to 6.041×102 Ωcm while the electrical conductivity of the films increased from 1.791×10−6 (Ωcm)−1 to 1.655×10−3 (Ωcm)−1 with increasing deposition time, Table 3. The measured values for the electrical conductivity of the present films are higher than the value reported by Thangaraju et al. [31], in which PbS thin films were deposited by spray pyrolysis technique and the conductivity was determined as 10−5 (Ωcm)−1, and Gadave et al. [32], in which PbS films were fabricated by CBD and the conductivity was found as 10−5–10−6 (Ωcm)−1.
The dependence of the electrical conductivity of the PbS films on film thickness is shown in Fig. 7. As seen, electrical conductivity of the films increases with increasing film thickness. Grain boundary scattering of free electrons in thicker films is less than in thinner films because of larger crystallite sizes. Since the conductivity (σ) is inversely proportional to the electron scattering frequency, γ ( σ=N e e 2 / m e ⁎ γ ) , the conductivity increases with increasing film thickness [33].

Thermoluminescence Studies:
Thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) is the phenomenon of the light emission during warming a previously irradiated substance with uniform heating rate. When a material is exposed to ionized radiation such as α, β, γ, X-rays and UV-rays or undergoes certain chemical reactions or mechanical stress, a certain percentage of the liberated charge carriers (electron and holes) may be trapped at certain imperfections in the lattice.

The reliability of the fitting procedure for glow curves was tested using the figure of merit (FOM) [39]. As seen, all the films have a main glow peak (called P3) at 200°C. The calculated activation energies of the films are very close to each other. However, y1 has the highest activation energy, intensity and a simpler glow curve structure in comparison with others. These properties make y1 a good candidate for TL.
When the PbS films are grown on a glass substrate by CBD method, the glass matrix and the PbS thin film composition is formed. The thickness and crystallite size of the films increase with the deposition time. In the present study, the film thickness was found in the range of 1095–1181nm. It is well known that within the nanometer region, the materials show different properties from that of their bulk materials. In thin films, the number of ions on the surface quickly increases as the crystallite size decreases. While the PbS films are irradiated by ionizing source, the electron–hole pairs are generated within the films by excitation of electron from the valence band to conduction band. The excited electrons and holes from the surface ions are easily trapped at the surface states. The trapped carriers at the surface states are released by heating the sample and they recombine with each other and give out thermoluminescence. The number of surface ions and surface states increase with decreasing crystallite size due to the increase of the ratio of the surface to volume. TL efficiency increases since the number of trapped charged particles at the surface state increases [40]. Therefore, it can be said that TL of the PbS films may be related to the surface states and y1 exhibits the highest TL intensity.

Conclusions:
The structural, optical, electrical and TL properties of the PbS thin films prepared by CBD with different deposition times of 100, 115, 130 and 145min are presented. The obtained films were analyzed by XRD, SEM, absorbance spectra, Hall and TL measurements. The XRD results indicate the formation of polycrystalline cubic rock salt structure of the PbS thin films. The optical band gap of the films decreased from 2.65eV to 2.50eV with increasing deposition time and this large optical band gap in the film is attributed to the quantum confinement effect. The electrical conductivity of the PbS films increased from 1.791×10−6 (Ωcm)−1 to 1.655×10−3 (Ωcm))−1 with increasing deposition time.
The TL study of β-irradiated PbS films with different deposition times are given in the present work. For all films, three main deconvoluted peaks (P1, P2 and P3) were obtained using the CGCD method. The trap energy levels for the main glow peak (P3) decrease from 0.50eV to 0.45eV with increasing deposition time. Trapping centers in grown PbS thin films with activation energies of 0.50, 0.48, 0.46 and 0.45eV were detected by the TL technique. These levels can be attributed to defects created during the crystals growth and/or unintentional impurities. Furthermore, small variations in grain size of PbS nanoparticles can give rise to significant modifications in the optical and electrical properties of PbS thin films.

Body:
PbS thin films, as one of the most important IV–VI group semiconductors, have attracted considerable attention in recent years as low-toxicity and cost-effective materials for use in solar cell fabrication. Moreover, these films have been the subject of considerable research due to their technological importance in crystalline and polycrystalline forms as gas sensors [1], infrared radiation detectors [2,3] and solar cells [4,5]. PbS thin films usually exhibit a p-type conduction, and their direct band gap can be varied in a wide range, up to 2.3eV, from the bulk value of 0.41eV. It is very important to vary morphological, optical and electrical properties of PbS thin films by adjusting the grain size using different deposition techniques, such as successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) [6], atomic layer deposition (ALD) [7], electro-deposition [8] and chemical bath deposition (CBD) [9]. The CBD method is one of the important techniques which can be performed using a range of precursors and synthesis conditions such as low temperature, deposition time, concentration, reactant pH. The optimization of these parameters leads to nanoparticles with different size [10] and shapes exhibiting different structural, optical and electrical properties.

There have been many attempts to understand structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of PbS thin films. However, the thermoluminescence (TL) method, which is widely used for the investigation of the charge carrier traps in materials, has not been applied for these films, yet. Moreover, size effects on the luminescence properties of PbS films remain an open research area.

In the present work, PbS thin films with different deposition times were prepared by CBD technique at room temperature. The structural, morphological, optical, electrical and thermoluminescence properties of the prepared PbS films were studied. TL properties of the PbS films were investigated after irradiating the films with beta source (D≈0.04Gy/s) for 15min at room temperature. The trap parameters were determined by the computer glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) method from the TL glow curves.

The PbS thin films were deposited on four glass substrates immersed in different beakers with the same solutions. Each solution was prepared in a 100ml beaker by the sequential addition of 5ml 0.5M (PbCH3COOH)·2H2O, 5ml 2M NaOH, 6ml 1M NH2CSNH2 and 4ml 0.5M C6H5Na3O7. The sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and tri-sodium citrate (TSC), (C6H5Na3O7) were used as complexing reagents. A total volume of 100ml was obtained by adding deionized water to the solution. Four types of films labeled y1, y2, y3 and y4 were prepared at room temperature for 100, 115, 130 and 145min, respectively. The colors of the obtained PbS thin films changed from light grey to dark grey with increasing deposition time. The reactions of the PbS formation on the glass substrate are given as [11] (1) Pb ( CH 3 COO ) 2 ⋅ 2 H 2 O + TSC ⇌ [ Pb ( TSC ) ] 2 + + 2 ( CH 3 COO − ) (2) [ Pb ( TSC ) ] 2 + ⇌ Pb 2 + + TSC (3) [ ( H 2 N ) 2 CS ] + OH − → CH 2 N 2 + H 2 O + HS − (4) HS − + OH − ⇌ H 2 O + S 2 − (5) Pb 2 + + S 2 − → PbS

The structure of PbS films was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), in the range of diffraction angle 20°≤2θ≤70° using a 0.02° with 40kV at 40mA, CuK α (1.54056Å) radiation using a Rigaku RadB diffractometer. The optical band gap of the films was evaluated using the absorption data recorded on a Perkin Elmer UV/VIS Lambda 2S spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 300–1100nm using a non-coated glass as the reference beam. Hall measurements were performed by a HS-3000 Manual Ver 3.5 system, using Van der Pauw geometry, at a constant magnetic field of 0.54T. The thickness and the surface morphology of the films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM Philips 30XL SFEG, Nederland). The thicknesses of the films were also determined by the weight difference method (WDM) assuming the sample is uniform and dense as having a bulk density of 7.597gcm−3. The glow curves of the PbS films were measured using a Harshaw QS 3500 manual type TL Reader that is interfaced to a PC where all glow curves are analyzed. Glow curve read out was carried out on a platinum planchet at a linear heating rate of 1C/s. A continuous flux of nitrogen was used during the TL readouts to reduce chemiluminescence in the heated films. All films were irradiated using the same experimental setup of the β-source at room temperature.

The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the PbS films with different deposition times are shown in Fig. 1. It is clear from this figure that there are four diffraction peaks, which are indexed as cubic rock salt (NaCl)-type structure, as confirmed using a Standard PDF card (PDF card no: 05-0592). These peaks correspond to (111), (200), (220) and (311) lattice planes. As seen from Fig. 1, all obtained films generally exhibit poor crystalline structure because of a broad peak in the 2θ range of 20–40°. The growth mechanism of PbS film can be explained with three competing processes: homogenous deposition, heterogeneous precipitation and ion-by-ion growth. In homogenous deposition, the films have a poor crystalline structure, because they are formed by the adsorption of PbS particles and not by ion–ion deposition [12]. If the film is annealed in a nitrogen medium, a well crystallized PbS film could be obtained. A comparison of the observed XRD results for the PbS films with the standard values are given in Table 1.

The lattice parameters of all films were calculated using the (111) plane and d value (inter-planar spacing) for the cubic structure, which is given by [13] (6) 1 d 2=h 2 + k 2 + l 2 a 2 where (hkl) are the Miller indices of the plane concerned and a is the lattice parameter. The calculated lattice parameters for the PbS films have been listed in Table 1, which is in good agreement with the reported values [11] and the standard value of the lattice parameter taken from the PDF card (a=5.9362Å).

The surface morphology of PbS thin films was observed through SEM image analysis (35000× and 100000× magnifications) and these micrographs are given in Fig. 2. SEM micrographs with 35000× magnification indicate that average grain size in the obtained PbS films, in which spherical-like PbS nanoparticles are observed, increases approximately from 60nm to 217nm with increasing deposition time, as presented in Table 2. It can be noticed that all films visualized at 100000× magnification have randomly grown islands with different size and shapes, whose distributions on the surface are almost uniform. Among the islands, sparsely distributed hollow sites can be observed. Increasing deposition time results in a decrease in the size of the islands, whereas the hollow sites get smaller and sparser. Thus, denser and more homogeneous films could be produced by increasing deposition time.

Fig. 3 shows the SEM micrograph for cross-sectional morphology of PbS films. It is seen from the figure and Table 2 that the film thickness increases from approximately 93 to 110nm with increasing deposition time. Besides, smaller film thicknesses are obtained from SEM micrographs than the ones calculated through the WDM method.

The UV/VIS transmission and reflectance spectra of the PbS films are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). It is seen from Fig. 4(a) that the transparency of the deposited film decreased from 29.26% to 16.46% at a wavelength of 600nm with increasing deposition time. The optical absorption coefficient (α) for the films was calculated using the following equation [14]: (7) T=( 1 − R ) 2 exp ( α t ) , where T is the transmittance, R is the reflectance and t is the film thickness. The variation of the optical absorption coefficient with wavelength was analyzed to find out the nature of the electronic transition across the optical band gap. The nature of the transition was determined using the relation: (8) α h ν=B ( h ν − E g ) n , where B is a constant, h is Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency of photon and n is equal to 1/2 for direct band gaps [15]. The band gap (E g ) can be obtained by extrapolating the straight line of (αhν)2 vs. hν curve to intercept the horizontal hν axis. The calculated band gap of the films is shown in Fig. 5 and listed in Table 2. From the figure and table, it can be seen that the direct band gap of the sample decreased from 2.65eV to 2.50eV with increasing deposition time. Such high values can be attributed to quantum confinement effect [16,17] due to the small grain size of the polycrystalline film, and are consistent with the literature values of the PbS thin films grown by chemical bath deposition (CBD) process at room temperature on corning glass and Si(100) substrates, with the variation of polyethylene glycol (PEG300) amount in the solution [18–21]. The properties of nanocrystalline materials change from their corresponding bulk properties, because the sizes of the crystallites become comparable to the Bohr excitonic radius.

The refractive index distribution of a dielectric medium strongly influences the propagation of an optical wave front through micro-optical elements such as microlens, a gradient index (GRIN) lens, and a fiber lens. Knowledge of the refractive index profile of transparent or semi-transparent optical elements is very important, not only in characterizing the phase transformation and aberrations associated with focusing or imaging properties, but also in controlling the optical quality of the elements. Optical constants, such as the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) were calculated by using T and R spectra of the film. The complex refractive index for any solid material can be expressed as (9) n ⁎ ( λ )=n ( λ ) + i k ( λ ) .

The n and k values were calculated using following equations [22]: (10) k=α λ 4 π , (11) n=1 + R 1 − R + 4 R ( 1 − R ) 2 − k 2 .

The spectral curves of n and k are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). Both n and k values decrease with increasing wavelength. These indicate that the thin films absorb light in the studied region. The increase in the refractive index is associated with the fundamental band gap absorption. It is seen from this figure that both the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) increased from 2.92 to 3.63 and 0.23 to 0.35 with increasing deposition time at the wavelength of 600nm, respectively (Table 2). It can be seen that the calculated refractive index values are higher than those obtained in [23], and lower than the results reported earlier [9,24,25]. As also confirmed by the SEM images, the formation of denser films with increasing deposition time may be the cause of the increase in refractive indices of the films as given in Table 2. Moreover, the calculated ones for the extinction coefficient are higher than the corresponding reported values [24,14].

It is well known that the polarizability of any solid is proportional to its dielectric constant. The real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric constant are calculated using the following equations [26]: (12) ε 1=n 2 – k 2 , (13) ε 2=2 n k , where ε 1 is the real part and ε 2 is the imaginary part of the dielectric constant. The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant were calculated by using n and k values from Eqs. (12) and (13). The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant are shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d). As seen, obtained values for the real part are higher than those for the imaginary part. ε 1 and ε 2 parts of the dielectric constant increase from 8.46 to 13.08 and 1.37 to 2.58 with increasing deposition time at 600nm wavelength, respectively (Table 2). These values are in good agreement with those in Refs. [24,25].

Hall measurement results in Table 3 show the mobility, carrier concentration, resistivity and conductivity values of the PbS films with different deposition times. The obtained values for the Hall coefficients show that all films are of p-type conductivity. The carrier concentration and mobility of the film increased from 5.334×1012 to 5.307×1014 (cm−3) and 1.331 to 5.087 (cm2 V−1 s−1) with increasing deposition time, respectively. The presented values for the mobility of the films are higher than the reported values [27–30]. As seen, the electrical resistivity for the PbS films decreased from 5.583×105 Ωcm to 6.041×102 Ωcm while the electrical conductivity of the films increased from 1.791×10−6 (Ωcm)−1 to 1.655×10−3 (Ωcm)−1 with increasing deposition time, Table 3. The measured values for the electrical conductivity of the present films are higher than the value reported by Thangaraju et al. [31], in which PbS thin films were deposited by spray pyrolysis technique and the conductivity was determined as 10−5 (Ωcm)−1, and Gadave et al. [32], in which PbS films were fabricated by CBD and the conductivity was found as 10−5–10−6 (Ωcm)−1.

The dependence of the electrical conductivity of the PbS films on film thickness is shown in Fig. 7. As seen, electrical conductivity of the films increases with increasing film thickness. Grain boundary scattering of free electrons in thicker films is less than in thinner films because of larger crystallite sizes. Since the conductivity (σ) is inversely proportional to the electron scattering frequency, γ ( σ=N e e 2 / m e ⁎ γ ) , the conductivity increases with increasing film thickness [33].

Thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) is the phenomenon of the light emission during warming a previously irradiated substance with uniform heating rate. When a material is exposed to ionized radiation such as α, β, γ, X-rays and UV-rays or undergoes certain chemical reactions or mechanical stress, a certain percentage of the liberated charge carriers (electron and holes) may be trapped at certain imperfections in the lattice. A dosimetric research of a thermoluminescent material is based on a virtue knowledge of its kinetic parameters which quantitatively describes the trapping–emitting centers principal for the thermoluminescence emission. There are particular techniques to evaluate the trapping parameters such as the activation energy (E a ), the pre-exponential factor (s) and the order of kinetics (b) from TL glow curves [34,35].

It should be noted that although photoluminescence properties of the PbS films were reported [36], the TL properties of chemical bath deposited PbS films with different deposition times have not been studied, yet. Thus, the TL properties of the PbS films (y1, y2, y3 and y4) are systematically investigated in this work. TL glow curves for the PbS films are shown in Fig. 8. The recorded glow curves of the films were analyzed using the CGCD method. This method has great advantages due to a simultaneous determination of kinetic parameters for all peaks without additional thermal treatments and experimental repetitions in comparison with other experimental methods. Also, this method uses all data points in the whole glow curve, rather than just a few points during the curve fitting procedures. It can be clearly understood from Ref. [37] that we need many data points to make a reliable prediction of the kinetic parameters. The CGCD program used here which is based on the least square minimization procedure was developed at the Reactor Institute at Delft, Netherlands. The results obtained by this method are available in Ref. [38]. The deconvoluted glow curves of the films are given in Fig. 9 and the related kinetic parameters are presented in Table 4. The reliability of the fitting procedure for glow curves was tested using the figure of merit (FOM) [39]. As seen, all the films have a main glow peak (called P3) at 200°C. The calculated activation energies of the films are very close to each other. However, y1 has the highest activation energy, intensity and a simpler glow curve structure in comparison with others. These properties make y1 a good candidate for TL.

When the PbS films are grown on a glass substrate by CBD method, the glass matrix and the PbS thin film composition is formed. The thickness and crystallite size of the films increase with the deposition time. In the present study, the film thickness was found in the range of 1095–1181nm. It is well known that within the nanometer region, the materials show different properties from that of their bulk materials. In thin films, the number of ions on the surface quickly increases as the crystallite size decreases. While the PbS films are irradiated by ionizing source, the electron–hole pairs are generated within the films by excitation of electron from the valence band to conduction band. The excited electrons and holes from the surface ions are easily trapped at the surface states. The trapped carriers at the surface states are released by heating the sample and they recombine with each other and give out thermoluminescence. The number of surface ions and surface states increase with decreasing crystallite size due to the increase of the ratio of the surface to volume. TL efficiency increases since the number of trapped charged particles at the surface state increases [40]. Therefore, it can be said that TL of the PbS films may be related to the surface states and y1 exhibits the highest TL intensity.

The structural, optical, electrical and TL properties of the PbS thin films prepared by CBD with different deposition times of 100, 115, 130 and 145min are presented. The obtained films were analyzed by XRD, SEM, absorbance spectra, Hall and TL measurements. The XRD results indicate the formation of polycrystalline cubic rock salt structure of the PbS thin films. The optical band gap of the films decreased from 2.65eV to 2.50eV with increasing deposition time and this large optical band gap in the film is attributed to the quantum confinement effect. The electrical conductivity of the PbS films increased from 1.791×10−6 (Ωcm)−1 to 1.655×10−3 (Ωcm))−1 with increasing deposition time.

The TL study of β-irradiated PbS films with different deposition times are given in the present work. For all films, three main deconvoluted peaks (P1, P2 and P3) were obtained using the CGCD method. The trap energy levels for the main glow peak (P3) decrease from 0.50eV to 0.45eV with increasing deposition time. Trapping centers in grown PbS thin films with activation energies of 0.50, 0.48, 0.46 and 0.45eV were detected by the TL technique. These levels can be attributed to defects created during the crystals growth and/or unintentional impurities. Furthermore, small variations in grain size of PbS nanoparticles can give rise to significant modifications in the optical and electrical properties of PbS thin films.

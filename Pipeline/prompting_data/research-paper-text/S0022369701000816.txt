Title:
Structures of [(CH

Abstract:
The room temperature structure of three members of the A 2 MX 4 cubic antifluorite family are reported. [(CH3)4P]2CoCl4 is orthorhombic, Pnma, a=18.385(2), b=25.134(3), c=12.758(3) Å, V=5895(2) Å3 with Z=12. [(CH3)4Sb]2CuCl4 is cubic, F 4 ̄ 3c, a=25.020(3) Å with V=15,663(3) Å3. [(CH3)4Sb]2ZnBr4 is also cubic, F 4 ̄ 3c, a=25.977(3) Å, V=17,529(4) Å3 with Z=32. The structures are composed of discrete (CH3)4P+ or (CH3)4Sb+ cations and tetrahedral CoCl4 2−, CuCl4 2− or ZnBr4 2− anions. All three are commensurately modulated and the superspace group is subsequently assigned to (TMSb)2CuCl4 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4. The structures are correlated by an ascent of symmetry diagram with a fictional, pseudo-antifluorite Fm 3 ̄ m aristotype having ≈12.7Å axes. The previously reported room temperature structures of [(CH3)4As]2ZnCl4 and [(CH3)4As]2CoCl4, as well as the structures of their estimated, higher temperature phases, are similarly correlated.

Introduction:
The [(CH3)4N]2 MX 4 family of compounds is well known for interesting phase transitions and modulated phases, both commensurate and incommensurate. By replacing the central nitrogen atom of the cation with the higher pnicogens, Pn=P, As and Sb, our laboratory has recently extended this family to include another 20 [(CH3)4 Pn]2 MX 4 (hereafter (TMPn)2 MX 4) salts [1]. Two of these, (TMP)2CuC14, and (TMP)2CuBr4, have been shown to have incommensurate phases. The chloride salt is characterized by a widely varying modulation vector [2,3], while the range of incommensuration is much smaller for the bromide salt [4].
In the survey of all twenty compounds it was shown that the (TMPn)2 MX 4 salts fall into two structural classes: the well known (distorted) β-K2SO4 class, containing all the N analogs, and another, the (TMAs)2CoCl4 class. Besides this prototype, the structure of one other member of this new class, (TMAs)2ZnCl4, has been reported [5]. The tentative inclusion of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMP)2ZnC14, (TMAs)2CuCl4, (TMSb)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4, (TMSb)2ZnCl4, (TMSb)2CoBr4, (TMsb)2CuBr4, and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 into this new class was based on an apparent association with a cubic unit cell having ≈12.7Å axes. These latter nine compounds have axial lengths of ≈12.7, ≈ 2 ×12.7 or ≈2×12.7Å. These structures are closely related to the (Et4N)2 MX 4 series [6,7,16].
The Bravais lattices and phase transitions were also reported for these compounds. At room temperature, the phosphorus containing salts have primitive orthorhombic unit cells, (TMAs)2CuCl4 has a body centered tetragonal cell, (TMAs)2CoCl4 and (TMAs)2ZnCl4 have primitive tetragonal cells (P42/mbc), and the antimony containing salts have face centered cubic unit cells. DSC results showed at least one thermal anomaly for each compound. The anomalies probably correspond either to phase transitions, resulting in a change of space group symmetry, or to decomposition, particularly for anomalies observed at higher temperatures. TMP salts. (TMP)2CoCl4 and (TMP)2ZnCl4 each showed two similar anomalies between 103 and 523K, one with T tr≈320K and ΔS tr≈1.4R; the other with T tr≈462K and ΔS tr≈2.0R. TMAs salts. (TMAs)2CuCl4 showed two anomalies between 113 and 573K, one with T tr=260K and ΔS tr=0.7R; the other with T tr=488K and ΔS tr=0.4R. (TMAs)2CoCl4 and (TMAs)2ZnCl4 showed two anomalies between 103 and 573K, one with T tr≈337K and ΔS tr≈0.9R; the other with T tr≈547K and ΔS tr≈0.3R. TMSb salts. The TMSb salts, with the exception of (TMSb)2CuCl4 and (TMSb)2CuBr4, each showed one anomaly between 113 and 523K, with 446K<T tr<475K and 0.9R<ΔS tr<l.5R. (TMSb)2CuCl4 showed four anomalies between 113 and 493K (decomposition), with T tr=140K and ΔS tr=1.0R; T tr=160K and ΔS tr=0.3R; T tr=408K and ΔS tr=0.9R; and T tr=490K and ΔS tr=0.7R. (TMSb)2CuBr4 showed three anomalies between 103 and 488K (decomposition), with T tr=178K and ΔS tr=0.9R; T tr=359K and ΔS tr=1.0R; and T tr=478K and ΔS tr=0.3R.
This paper reports the further correlation of the members of this new (TMAs)2CoCl4 family through the room temperature single crystal X-ray structure analyses of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4, and (TMSb)2ZnBr4, and through a reconsideration of the reported structures of (TMAs)2CoCl4 and (TMAs)2ZnCl4.

Experimental:
2.1 Synthesis The syntheses of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4, and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 have been reported previously [2]. X-ray data collection and reduction The data collection and reduction techniques that were common to all three compounds are as follows. X-ray data were collected on a Syntex P21 diffractometer upgraded to Siemens/Nicolet P3F or P4 specifications using graphite monochromated MoKα (λ=0.71069Å) radiation. The data were profile fit and Lorentz and polarization corrections were made. The structures, except (TMSb)2ZnBr4, were solved by direct methods [8], with final refinements made with SHELXTL or SHELXTL PLUS [9] software (TMSb+ salts only). The function minimized was ∑w(|F o|−|F c|)2 with w clarified in Table 1 . The atomic scattering factors of SHELXTL or SHELXTL PLUS were used. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were constrained to C–H distances of 0.96Å and their isotropic thermal parameters were set at ≈1.2 times the equivalent isotropic thermal parameters of associated carbon atoms. Other lattice and data collection parameters are listed in Table 1. (TMP)2CoCl4 No significant changes in check reflection intensities, monitored every 96 reflections, were observed during data collection. The systematic extinctions indicated either centrosymmetric Pnma or noncentrosymmetric Pn21 a space groups. The structure refined smoothly, but slowly, in Pnma and the noncentrosymmetric option was not tested, as the refined model was not excessively disordered perpendicular to the mirror plane. (TMSb)2CuCl4 No significant changes in check reflection intensities, monitored every 100 reflections, were observed during data collection. Systematic extinctions indicated F 4 ̄ 3c or Fm3c as possible space groups. The centrosymmetric choice seemed unlikely, however, because the tetrahedral anions would be required to lie on sites with inversion symmetry. The structure refined smoothly in F 4 ̄ 3c to wR=0.046, subject to loose constraints of the Sb–C bond distances to approximately 2.1Å (using the DFlX command in SHELXTL PLUS). (TMSb)2ZnBr4 The structure was solved in the space group F 4 ̄ 3c by starting with the refined coordinates of the (TMSb)2CuCl4 structure. The structure refined smoothly to wR=0.058. However, the thermal parameters for one of the carbon atoms, C(4), refined to unreasonable values. An analysis of ‖F o|−|F c‖/σ(F o) data showed two reflections, (0, 0, 6) and (0, 2, 6), with ‖F o|−|F c‖/σ(F o) values greater than almost twice that of any other reflections. These reflections were removed, the refinement converged with wR=0.054, with reasonable behavior of the thermal parameters for C(4).

Results And Discussion:
The final atomic parameters for (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4, and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 at room temperature are listed in Table 2 and bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 3 . The unit cell of (TMP)2CoCl4 is shown in Fig. 1 and a stereoview of an octant of the unit cell of (TMSb)2ZnBr4, with 0<x, y, z<1/2, is shown in Fig. 2 .
The room temperature structures of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 are composed of discrete monopositive cations and dinegative anions [10]. The ions are significantly disordered, as shown by the large carbon thermal ellipsoids for the atoms in the cations and the even larger halide atom ellipsoids of most of the atoms in the anions. The significantly smaller ellipsoids of the central atoms of the ions imply that the disorder, if dynamic, is primarily librational, involving rotations about the centers of mass. Whether static or dynamic, the disorder leaves the geometries of the individual ions somewhat uncertain. The high symmetry sites occupied by the anions in the cubic structures of (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 further complicate the analysis of their geometries.
In (TMSb)2CuCl4 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 at room temperature, the MX 4 2− anions occupy two crystallographically inequivalent sites, having 23.(T) and 4 ̄ ..(S4) symmetry. In both salts the anions occupying the 23. sites show similarly large thermal ellipsoids for their halide atoms (U eq≈0.20Å), indicating significant disorder. The similar ellipsoids for both salts implies that the disorder for the copper salt is not primarily due to the averaging of expected tetragonally compressed CuC14 2− tetrahedra caused by the Jahn–Teller effect. The anions occupying the S4 sites are significantly less disordered and are nearly tetrahedral, with maximum bond angles of 116.1(3) and 113.2(2)° for the copper and zinc salts, respectively. The 116.1° angle is significantly smaller than the expected 128–140° range typically found in discrete Jahn–Teller distorted CuCl4 2− anions in similar structures [11,12].
The expected Jahn–Teller distortion of the CuCl4 2− anions also explains the different phase transition sequences experienced by the (TMSb)2CuX 4 (X=Cl, Br) salts versus the (TMSb)2 MX 4 (M=Co, Zn; X=Cl, Br) salts. As reviewed in the Introduction, (TMSb)2CuCl4 apparently undergoes two phase transitions below room temperature, (TMSb)2CuBr4 apparently undergoes one, and the rest of the (TMSb)2 MX 4 salts undergo no sub-room temperature phase transitions. All of these Sb salts have F centered cubic lattices and are probably isomorphic. Then if, as expected, the CuX 4 2− anions are Jahn–Teller distorted, the onset of ordering in the Cu salts at lower temperatures requires the simultaneous lowering of the anion site symmetries to D2d or one of its subgroups, which in turn drives the phase transitions to lower symmetry space groups. The Co and Zn salts require no such lowering of their anion site symmetries with the onset of ordering at lower temperatures. A similar situation has been observed in the M 2 I M II[Cu(NO2)6] and M 2 I M II[Ni(NO2)6] series of compounds [13]. The M 2 I M II[Cu(NO2)6] compounds undergo cubic to orthorhombic phase transitions that are unobserved in the nickel analogs.
In (TMP)2CoCl4 at room temperature, the CoCl4 2− anions occupy two crystallographically inequivalent sites, having .m. (Cs) and 1 (C1) symmetry. The anions are generally more ordered than in the Sb salts, as shown by the halide atom thermal parameters (0.09<U eq<0.16Å). The anions vary little from tetrahedral geometries, with a maximum bond angle of l12.8°.
The geometries of the (CH3)4 Pn + cations of all three structures appear to be close to tetrahedral. However, the large thermal ellipsoids and uncertainties in the positions of the carbon atoms lead to poor definition of the cation geometries. The (CH3)4P+ cations of the (TMP)2CoCl4 structure show the most distortion, with angles varying from 103.8(9) to 114.9(5)°. The (CH3)4Sb+ cations of the of (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 structures have angles varying from 108.3(7) to 110.5(9)° for the former and from 106.4(8) to 112.4(7)° for the latter.
The room temperature unit cells of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 may be considered to be the result of commensurate modulations of smaller parent unit cells. For (TMP)2CoCl4, reflections with h≠2n and k≠3m (n, m integers) are weak. Therefore, the structure may be considered as having a parent cell, with basis vectors of a ′=a /2, b ′=b /3, and c ′=c , which is commensurately modulated in two dimensions with the modulation vectors k1=a *′/2 and k2=b*′/3(a*′=2a*, b *′=3 b *, c *′=c *). For (TMSb)2CuCl4 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4, reflections with h+k+l≠2n are weak, which indicates parent structures with basis vectors of a ′=a /2, b ′=b /2, and c ′=c /2, and the one-dimensional commensurate modulation vector k=(a*′+b*′+c*′)/2( a *′=2 a *, b *′=2 b *, c *′=2 c *). The modulation is one-dimensional in the sense that the primary reflections, corresponding to the parent structure, can be indexed by integers h′, k′, and l′ with respect to a *′, b *′, and c *′, but indexing the satellite reflections, caused by the modulation, requires an additional integer, m, related to k . Using the superspace notation developed for one-dimensional modulated structures, [14,15] the 3+1 superspace Bravais Class of the room temperature structures of (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 is T Pm3̄m 1̄1̄s ( 1 2 , 1 2 , 1 2 ) and their common superspace group is T Pm3̄m 1̄1̄s .
3.1 Ascent of symmetry analyses The arrangement of ions in all three salts is conveniently understood in terms of an imaginary common aristotype structure having a pseudo-antifluorite arrangement of ions. For reference and review, a schematic view of the binary antifluorite structure type is included as Fig. 3 . The antifluorite structure has a cubic, Fm 3 ̄ m unit cell with anions at Wyckoff position a at (0, 0, 0)+ and cations at Wyckoff position c at (1/4, 1/4, 1/4)+ and (1/4, 1/4, 3/4)+, where the plus signs include the coordinates due to the F centering [10]. Each of the four anions per unit cell is coordinated by eight cations in a cubic arrangement. The site symmetry of each is m3m (Oh). The eight cations per unit cell are each tetrahedrally coordinated by four anions, in agreement with the 4 ̄ 3m site symmetry. The pseudoantifluorite aristotype has tetrahedral ions, with Td symmetry, centered at these same sites. The ‘pseudo-’ modifier refers to the non-binary nature of the aristotype structure. Necessarily, the anions of the aristotype are each two-fold disordered, corresponding to the addition of the center of inversion needed to generate Oh from Td. The axial lengths are ≈12.7Å. The structures of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 are lower symmetry analogs of the aristotype. The latter two Sb salts have nearly isostructural arrangements of ions, so the following discussion or pictures of (TMSb)2ZnBr4 also apply to (TMSb)2CuCl4. The similarity of the three salts to each other and to the fictional aristotype becomes apparent after comparing Figs. 2–4 . Figs. 2 and 4 show sub-unit cells of (TMSb)2ZnBr4 and (TMP)2CoCl4 corresponding to a single unit cell of the Fm 3 ̄ m aristotype. The octant (TMSb)2ZnBr4 shown in Fig. 2 coincides with the modulated parent cell discussed above, so an adjacent (unpictured) octant is similar. Thus, the octant may be considered a quasi-unit cell. The anions at the face-centers of the quasi-unit cell are primarily responsible for breaking the quasi-periodicity along x, y, and z. An examination of Fig. 2 shows that the anions at the opposite sides of the quasi-unit cell are non-superimposable near-mirror images. The subsection of (TMP)2CoCl4 shown in Fig. 4 is a simple multiple (doubling) of the modulated parent cell discussed above, so it also represents a quasi-unit cell. The transformation from the modulated parent cell to this subsection is a ′=a − b , b ′=a + b , and c′=c . Or, the transformation from the actual unit cell to this subsection is a ′=a /2− b /3, b ′=a /2+ b /3, and c′=c . In Figs. 1 and 4 an oriented arrow points toward symmetry equivalent anions, allowing the orientation of the sub-unit cell of Fig. 4 to be visualized with respect to the unit cell of Fig. 1. The relationships between the fictional Fm3̄m aristotype and the reported structures of the (TMAs)2CoCl4 family are explicitly shown by the ascent of symmetry diagram in Fig. 5 . The space groups of the seven observed structures form the base of the diagram. The other space groups, of intermediate symmetry between those of the observed structures and the fictional aristotype, form paths of minimal supergroups. For each of these intermediate space groups, as well as for the aristotype group, hypothetical structures can be discussed in terms of the required site symmetries of their constituent ions (derived below). In this respect it is convenient to separate the space groups into two classes: those (observed or hypothetical) in which the ions occupy sites with symmetry of Td parentage (starred in Fig. 5) or, conversely, those in which the occupied sites have point group symmetry not subgroup related to Td. In fact, space groups for the latter case (no star) all require centers of inversion at some or all of the hypothetical anion sites. Thus, the space groups indicated by asterisks are the most plausible candidates for the higher temperature phases of the observed structures. In regard to these alternate paths of ascent it may be noted that there are no plausible supergroups of C42/mcd (P42/mbc), the space group of the room temperature phase structures of (TMAs)2ZnCl4 and (TMAs)2CoCl4. Instead, the tentative space group assigned to both of these salts above the transition at ≈337K is I41/a, a site-compatible space group, but one not related to P42/mbc in any direct supergroup or subgroup manner. Thus, the associated first order phase transition observed for these two salts can be understood based on the assumption that the ions will remain in sites of symmetry with Td parentage. Fig. 6(a)–(d) further detail the various paths of symmetry shown in Fig. 5. Each gives the paths of symmetry starting with the space group of observed or suspected structures, passing through all site-compatible higher symmetry space groups and finishing with the Fm3m space group of the fictional pseudo-antifluorite aristotype structure. The ascent of symmetry diagrammatic method has been chosen over the more conventional descent of symmetry method to allow the explicit notation of all the additional generators needed to produce the minimal supergroups G from H. By ascending in symmetry, the added generators are expressed in the basis of H, often the basis of a larger unit cell than that of G. An example shows the advantage: addition of T(1/2, 0, 0) to F 4 ̄ 3c obviously leads to the additional lattice points necessary to produce the eight primitive P 4 ̄ 3m unit cells from each F 4 ̄ 3c unit cell. Conversely, the descent of symmetry from P 4 ̄ 3m to F 4 ̄ 3c would be difficult to express symbolically in the basis of the smaller P 4 ̄ 3m unit cell. With respect to the analysis of (TMP)2CoC14, (TMSb)2ZnBr4 and (TMSb)2CuCl4 as modulated structures, as discussed above, the space groups of the unmodulated parent structures can be obtained directly from Fig. 6(d) and 6(a). The unmodulated parent space group of (TMP)2CoCl4 is Pnmm with axes of a′≈9.193Å, b′≈8.378Å, and c′≈12.758Å. The unmodulated parent space group of (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 is P 4 ̄ 3m with a′≈12.511Å and a′≈12.984Å, respectively. As mentioned above, the site symmetries of the constituent ions of the hypothetical pseudo-antifluorite structure can be determined. The determined site symmetries of the ions are listed in Table 4 along with their Wyckoff positions as listed in the International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. A. [10]. The listed ion positions are uniquely determined, within a trivial change of origin, by the observed positions of the ions of the known structures in conjunction with the assumption that the structures will tend toward the pseudo-antifluorite structure with increasing symmetry. In particular, the special sets of anion positions of the I4l/a structures of (TMAs)2CoCl4 and (TMAs)2ZnCl4, believed to occur above T≈337K, are predicted uniquely.

Ascent Of Symmetry Analyses:
The arrangement of ions in all three salts is conveniently understood in terms of an imaginary common aristotype structure having a pseudo-antifluorite arrangement of ions. For reference and review, a schematic view of the binary antifluorite structure type is included as Fig. 3 . The antifluorite structure has a cubic, Fm 3 ̄ m unit cell with anions at Wyckoff position a at (0, 0, 0)+ and cations at Wyckoff position c at (1/4, 1/4, 1/4)+ and (1/4, 1/4, 3/4)+, where the plus signs include the coordinates due to the F centering [10]. Each of the four anions per unit cell is coordinated by eight cations in a cubic arrangement. The site symmetry of each is m3m (Oh). The eight cations per unit cell are each tetrahedrally coordinated by four anions, in agreement with the 4 ̄ 3m site symmetry. The pseudoantifluorite aristotype has tetrahedral ions, with Td symmetry, centered at these same sites. The ‘pseudo-’ modifier refers to the non-binary nature of the aristotype structure. Necessarily, the anions of the aristotype are each two-fold disordered, corresponding to the addition of the center of inversion needed to generate Oh from Td. The axial lengths are ≈12.7Å.
The structures of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 are lower symmetry analogs of the aristotype. The latter two Sb salts have nearly isostructural arrangements of ions, so the following discussion or pictures of (TMSb)2ZnBr4 also apply to (TMSb)2CuCl4. The similarity of the three salts to each other and to the fictional aristotype becomes apparent after comparing Figs. 2–4 . Figs. 2 and 4 show sub-unit cells of (TMSb)2ZnBr4 and (TMP)2CoCl4 corresponding to a single unit cell of the Fm 3 ̄ m aristotype. The octant (TMSb)2ZnBr4 shown in Fig. 2 coincides with the modulated parent cell discussed above, so an adjacent (unpictured) octant is similar. Thus, the octant may be considered a quasi-unit cell. The anions at the face-centers of the quasi-unit cell are primarily responsible for breaking the quasi-periodicity along x, y, and z. An examination of Fig. 2 shows that the anions at the opposite sides of the quasi-unit cell are non-superimposable near-mirror images. The subsection of (TMP)2CoCl4 shown in Fig. 4 is a simple multiple (doubling) of the modulated parent cell discussed above, so it also represents a quasi-unit cell. The transformation from the modulated parent cell to this subsection is a ′=a − b , b ′=a + b , and c′=c . Or, the transformation from the actual unit cell to this subsection is a ′=a /2− b /3, b ′=a /2+ b /3, and c′=c . In Figs. 1 and 4 an oriented arrow points toward symmetry equivalent anions, allowing the orientation of the sub-unit cell of Fig. 4 to be visualized with respect to the unit cell of Fig. 1.
The relationships between the fictional Fm3̄m aristotype and the reported structures of the (TMAs)2CoCl4 family are explicitly shown by the ascent of symmetry diagram in Fig. 5 . The space groups of the seven observed structures form the base of the diagram. The other space groups, of intermediate symmetry between those of the observed structures and the fictional aristotype, form paths of minimal supergroups. For each of these intermediate space groups, as well as for the aristotype group, hypothetical structures can be discussed in terms of the required site symmetries of their constituent ions (derived below). In this respect it is convenient to separate the space groups into two classes: those (observed or hypothetical) in which the ions occupy sites with symmetry of Td parentage (starred in Fig. 5) or, conversely, those in which the occupied sites have point group symmetry not subgroup related to Td. In fact, space groups for the latter case (no star) all require centers of inversion at some or all of the hypothetical anion sites. Thus, the space groups indicated by asterisks are the most plausible candidates for the higher temperature phases of the observed structures.
In regard to these alternate paths of ascent it may be noted that there are no plausible supergroups of C42/mcd (P42/mbc), the space group of the room temperature phase structures of (TMAs)2ZnCl4 and (TMAs)2CoCl4. Instead, the tentative space group assigned to both of these salts above the transition at ≈337K is I41/a, a site-compatible space group, but one not related to P42/mbc in any direct supergroup or subgroup manner. Thus, the associated first order phase transition observed for these two salts can be understood based on the assumption that the ions will remain in sites of symmetry with Td parentage.
Fig. 6(a)–(d) further detail the various paths of symmetry shown in Fig. 5. Each gives the paths of symmetry starting with the space group of observed or suspected structures, passing through all site-compatible higher symmetry space groups and finishing with the Fm3m space group of the fictional pseudo-antifluorite aristotype structure.
The ascent of symmetry diagrammatic method has been chosen over the more conventional descent of symmetry method to allow the explicit notation of all the additional generators needed to produce the minimal supergroups G from H. By ascending in symmetry, the added generators are expressed in the basis of H, often the basis of a larger unit cell than that of G. An example shows the advantage: addition of T(1/2, 0, 0) to F 4 ̄ 3c obviously leads to the additional lattice points necessary to produce the eight primitive P 4 ̄ 3m unit cells from each F 4 ̄ 3c unit cell. Conversely, the descent of symmetry from P 4 ̄ 3m to F 4 ̄ 3c would be difficult to express symbolically in the basis of the smaller P 4 ̄ 3m unit cell.
With respect to the analysis of (TMP)2CoC14, (TMSb)2ZnBr4 and (TMSb)2CuCl4 as modulated structures, as discussed above, the space groups of the unmodulated parent structures can be obtained directly from Fig. 6(d) and 6(a). The unmodulated parent space group of (TMP)2CoCl4 is Pnmm with axes of a′≈9.193Å, b′≈8.378Å, and c′≈12.758Å. The unmodulated parent space group of (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 is P 4 ̄ 3m with a′≈12.511Å and a′≈12.984Å, respectively.
As mentioned above, the site symmetries of the constituent ions of the hypothetical pseudo-antifluorite structure can be determined. The determined site symmetries of the ions are listed in Table 4 along with their Wyckoff positions as listed in the International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. A. [10]. The listed ion positions are uniquely determined, within a trivial change of origin, by the observed positions of the ions of the known structures in conjunction with the assumption that the structures will tend toward the pseudo-antifluorite structure with increasing symmetry. In particular, the special sets of anion positions of the I4l/a structures of (TMAs)2CoCl4 and (TMAs)2ZnCl4, believed to occur above T≈337K, are predicted uniquely.

Summary:
The room temperature structures of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4, and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 have been determined. All three salts can be considered as commensurately modulated structures, and, for the latter two, a 3+1 dimensional superspace group has been assigned.
These structures, as well as the room temperature and hypothesized higher temperature structures of (TMAs)2CoCl4 and (TMAs)2ZnCl4, have been correlated by an ascent of symmetry diagram with a fictitious Fm 3 ̄ m aristotype. Based on lattice parameters obtained at room temperature, the other (TMPn)2 MX 4 compounds of the (TMAs)2CoCl4 family can also be assumed to have distorted pseudo-antifluorite structures.

Body:
The [(CH3)4N]2 MX 4 family of compounds is well known for interesting phase transitions and modulated phases, both commensurate and incommensurate. By replacing the central nitrogen atom of the cation with the higher pnicogens, Pn=P, As and Sb, our laboratory has recently extended this family to include another 20 [(CH3)4 Pn]2 MX 4 (hereafter (TMPn)2 MX 4) salts [1]. Two of these, (TMP)2CuC14, and (TMP)2CuBr4, have been shown to have incommensurate phases. The chloride salt is characterized by a widely varying modulation vector [2,3], while the range of incommensuration is much smaller for the bromide salt [4].

In the survey of all twenty compounds it was shown that the (TMPn)2 MX 4 salts fall into two structural classes: the well known (distorted) β-K2SO4 class, containing all the N analogs, and another, the (TMAs)2CoCl4 class. Besides this prototype, the structure of one other member of this new class, (TMAs)2ZnCl4, has been reported [5]. The tentative inclusion of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMP)2ZnC14, (TMAs)2CuCl4, (TMSb)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4, (TMSb)2ZnCl4, (TMSb)2CoBr4, (TMsb)2CuBr4, and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 into this new class was based on an apparent association with a cubic unit cell having ≈12.7Å axes. These latter nine compounds have axial lengths of ≈12.7, ≈ 2 ×12.7 or ≈2×12.7Å. These structures are closely related to the (Et4N)2 MX 4 series [6,7,16].

The Bravais lattices and phase transitions were also reported for these compounds. At room temperature, the phosphorus containing salts have primitive orthorhombic unit cells, (TMAs)2CuCl4 has a body centered tetragonal cell, (TMAs)2CoCl4 and (TMAs)2ZnCl4 have primitive tetragonal cells (P42/mbc), and the antimony containing salts have face centered cubic unit cells. DSC results showed at least one thermal anomaly for each compound. The anomalies probably correspond either to phase transitions, resulting in a change of space group symmetry, or to decomposition, particularly for anomalies observed at higher temperatures. TMP salts. (TMP)2CoCl4 and (TMP)2ZnCl4 each showed two similar anomalies between 103 and 523K, one with T tr≈320K and ΔS tr≈1.4R; the other with T tr≈462K and ΔS tr≈2.0R. TMAs salts. (TMAs)2CuCl4 showed two anomalies between 113 and 573K, one with T tr=260K and ΔS tr=0.7R; the other with T tr=488K and ΔS tr=0.4R. (TMAs)2CoCl4 and (TMAs)2ZnCl4 showed two anomalies between 103 and 573K, one with T tr≈337K and ΔS tr≈0.9R; the other with T tr≈547K and ΔS tr≈0.3R. TMSb salts. The TMSb salts, with the exception of (TMSb)2CuCl4 and (TMSb)2CuBr4, each showed one anomaly between 113 and 523K, with 446K<T tr<475K and 0.9R<ΔS tr<l.5R. (TMSb)2CuCl4 showed four anomalies between 113 and 493K (decomposition), with T tr=140K and ΔS tr=1.0R; T tr=160K and ΔS tr=0.3R; T tr=408K and ΔS tr=0.9R; and T tr=490K and ΔS tr=0.7R. (TMSb)2CuBr4 showed three anomalies between 103 and 488K (decomposition), with T tr=178K and ΔS tr=0.9R; T tr=359K and ΔS tr=1.0R; and T tr=478K and ΔS tr=0.3R.

This paper reports the further correlation of the members of this new (TMAs)2CoCl4 family through the room temperature single crystal X-ray structure analyses of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4, and (TMSb)2ZnBr4, and through a reconsideration of the reported structures of (TMAs)2CoCl4 and (TMAs)2ZnCl4.

The syntheses of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4, and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 have been reported previously [2].

The data collection and reduction techniques that were common to all three compounds are as follows. X-ray data were collected on a Syntex P21 diffractometer upgraded to Siemens/Nicolet P3F or P4 specifications using graphite monochromated MoKα (λ=0.71069Å) radiation. The data were profile fit and Lorentz and polarization corrections were made. The structures, except (TMSb)2ZnBr4, were solved by direct methods [8], with final refinements made with SHELXTL or SHELXTL PLUS [9] software (TMSb+ salts only). The function minimized was ∑w(|F o|−|F c|)2 with w clarified in Table 1 . The atomic scattering factors of SHELXTL or SHELXTL PLUS were used. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were constrained to C–H distances of 0.96Å and their isotropic thermal parameters were set at ≈1.2 times the equivalent isotropic thermal parameters of associated carbon atoms. Other lattice and data collection parameters are listed in Table 1.

No significant changes in check reflection intensities, monitored every 96 reflections, were observed during data collection. The systematic extinctions indicated either centrosymmetric Pnma or noncentrosymmetric Pn21 a space groups. The structure refined smoothly, but slowly, in Pnma and the noncentrosymmetric option was not tested, as the refined model was not excessively disordered perpendicular to the mirror plane.

No significant changes in check reflection intensities, monitored every 100 reflections, were observed during data collection. Systematic extinctions indicated F 4 ̄ 3c or Fm3c as possible space groups. The centrosymmetric choice seemed unlikely, however, because the tetrahedral anions would be required to lie on sites with inversion symmetry. The structure refined smoothly in F 4 ̄ 3c to wR=0.046, subject to loose constraints of the Sb–C bond distances to approximately 2.1Å (using the DFlX command in SHELXTL PLUS).

The structure was solved in the space group F 4 ̄ 3c by starting with the refined coordinates of the (TMSb)2CuCl4 structure. The structure refined smoothly to wR=0.058. However, the thermal parameters for one of the carbon atoms, C(4), refined to unreasonable values. An analysis of ‖F o|−|F c‖/σ(F o) data showed two reflections, (0, 0, 6) and (0, 2, 6), with ‖F o|−|F c‖/σ(F o) values greater than almost twice that of any other reflections. These reflections were removed, the refinement converged with wR=0.054, with reasonable behavior of the thermal parameters for C(4).

The final atomic parameters for (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4, and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 at room temperature are listed in Table 2 and bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 3 . The unit cell of (TMP)2CoCl4 is shown in Fig. 1 and a stereoview of an octant of the unit cell of (TMSb)2ZnBr4, with 0<x, y, z<1/2, is shown in Fig. 2 .

The room temperature structures of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 are composed of discrete monopositive cations and dinegative anions [10]. The ions are significantly disordered, as shown by the large carbon thermal ellipsoids for the atoms in the cations and the even larger halide atom ellipsoids of most of the atoms in the anions. The significantly smaller ellipsoids of the central atoms of the ions imply that the disorder, if dynamic, is primarily librational, involving rotations about the centers of mass. Whether static or dynamic, the disorder leaves the geometries of the individual ions somewhat uncertain. The high symmetry sites occupied by the anions in the cubic structures of (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 further complicate the analysis of their geometries.

In (TMSb)2CuCl4 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 at room temperature, the MX 4 2− anions occupy two crystallographically inequivalent sites, having 23.(T) and 4 ̄ ..(S4) symmetry. In both salts the anions occupying the 23. sites show similarly large thermal ellipsoids for their halide atoms (U eq≈0.20Å), indicating significant disorder. The similar ellipsoids for both salts implies that the disorder for the copper salt is not primarily due to the averaging of expected tetragonally compressed CuC14 2− tetrahedra caused by the Jahn–Teller effect. The anions occupying the S4 sites are significantly less disordered and are nearly tetrahedral, with maximum bond angles of 116.1(3) and 113.2(2)° for the copper and zinc salts, respectively. The 116.1° angle is significantly smaller than the expected 128–140° range typically found in discrete Jahn–Teller distorted CuCl4 2− anions in similar structures [11,12].

The expected Jahn–Teller distortion of the CuCl4 2− anions also explains the different phase transition sequences experienced by the (TMSb)2CuX 4 (X=Cl, Br) salts versus the (TMSb)2 MX 4 (M=Co, Zn; X=Cl, Br) salts. As reviewed in the Introduction, (TMSb)2CuCl4 apparently undergoes two phase transitions below room temperature, (TMSb)2CuBr4 apparently undergoes one, and the rest of the (TMSb)2 MX 4 salts undergo no sub-room temperature phase transitions. All of these Sb salts have F centered cubic lattices and are probably isomorphic. Then if, as expected, the CuX 4 2− anions are Jahn–Teller distorted, the onset of ordering in the Cu salts at lower temperatures requires the simultaneous lowering of the anion site symmetries to D2d or one of its subgroups, which in turn drives the phase transitions to lower symmetry space groups. The Co and Zn salts require no such lowering of their anion site symmetries with the onset of ordering at lower temperatures. A similar situation has been observed in the M 2 I M II[Cu(NO2)6] and M 2 I M II[Ni(NO2)6] series of compounds [13]. The M 2 I M II[Cu(NO2)6] compounds undergo cubic to orthorhombic phase transitions that are unobserved in the nickel analogs.

In (TMP)2CoCl4 at room temperature, the CoCl4 2− anions occupy two crystallographically inequivalent sites, having .m. (Cs) and 1 (C1) symmetry. The anions are generally more ordered than in the Sb salts, as shown by the halide atom thermal parameters (0.09<U eq<0.16Å). The anions vary little from tetrahedral geometries, with a maximum bond angle of l12.8°.

The geometries of the (CH3)4 Pn + cations of all three structures appear to be close to tetrahedral. However, the large thermal ellipsoids and uncertainties in the positions of the carbon atoms lead to poor definition of the cation geometries. The (CH3)4P+ cations of the (TMP)2CoCl4 structure show the most distortion, with angles varying from 103.8(9) to 114.9(5)°. The (CH3)4Sb+ cations of the of (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 structures have angles varying from 108.3(7) to 110.5(9)° for the former and from 106.4(8) to 112.4(7)° for the latter.

The room temperature unit cells of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 may be considered to be the result of commensurate modulations of smaller parent unit cells. For (TMP)2CoCl4, reflections with h≠2n and k≠3m (n, m integers) are weak. Therefore, the structure may be considered as having a parent cell, with basis vectors of a ′=a /2, b ′=b /3, and c ′=c , which is commensurately modulated in two dimensions with the modulation vectors k1=a *′/2 and k2=b*′/3(a*′=2a*, b *′=3 b *, c *′=c *). For (TMSb)2CuCl4 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4, reflections with h+k+l≠2n are weak, which indicates parent structures with basis vectors of a ′=a /2, b ′=b /2, and c ′=c /2, and the one-dimensional commensurate modulation vector k=(a*′+b*′+c*′)/2( a *′=2 a *, b *′=2 b *, c *′=2 c *). The modulation is one-dimensional in the sense that the primary reflections, corresponding to the parent structure, can be indexed by integers h′, k′, and l′ with respect to a *′, b *′, and c *′, but indexing the satellite reflections, caused by the modulation, requires an additional integer, m, related to k . Using the superspace notation developed for one-dimensional modulated structures, [14,15] the 3+1 superspace Bravais Class of the room temperature structures of (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 is T Pm3̄m 1̄1̄s ( 1 2 , 1 2 , 1 2 ) and their common superspace group is T Pm3̄m 1̄1̄s .

The arrangement of ions in all three salts is conveniently understood in terms of an imaginary common aristotype structure having a pseudo-antifluorite arrangement of ions. For reference and review, a schematic view of the binary antifluorite structure type is included as Fig. 3 . The antifluorite structure has a cubic, Fm 3 ̄ m unit cell with anions at Wyckoff position a at (0, 0, 0)+ and cations at Wyckoff position c at (1/4, 1/4, 1/4)+ and (1/4, 1/4, 3/4)+, where the plus signs include the coordinates due to the F centering [10]. Each of the four anions per unit cell is coordinated by eight cations in a cubic arrangement. The site symmetry of each is m3m (Oh). The eight cations per unit cell are each tetrahedrally coordinated by four anions, in agreement with the 4 ̄ 3m site symmetry. The pseudoantifluorite aristotype has tetrahedral ions, with Td symmetry, centered at these same sites. The ‘pseudo-’ modifier refers to the non-binary nature of the aristotype structure. Necessarily, the anions of the aristotype are each two-fold disordered, corresponding to the addition of the center of inversion needed to generate Oh from Td. The axial lengths are ≈12.7Å.

The structures of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 are lower symmetry analogs of the aristotype. The latter two Sb salts have nearly isostructural arrangements of ions, so the following discussion or pictures of (TMSb)2ZnBr4 also apply to (TMSb)2CuCl4. The similarity of the three salts to each other and to the fictional aristotype becomes apparent after comparing Figs. 2–4 . Figs. 2 and 4 show sub-unit cells of (TMSb)2ZnBr4 and (TMP)2CoCl4 corresponding to a single unit cell of the Fm 3 ̄ m aristotype. The octant (TMSb)2ZnBr4 shown in Fig. 2 coincides with the modulated parent cell discussed above, so an adjacent (unpictured) octant is similar. Thus, the octant may be considered a quasi-unit cell. The anions at the face-centers of the quasi-unit cell are primarily responsible for breaking the quasi-periodicity along x, y, and z. An examination of Fig. 2 shows that the anions at the opposite sides of the quasi-unit cell are non-superimposable near-mirror images. The subsection of (TMP)2CoCl4 shown in Fig. 4 is a simple multiple (doubling) of the modulated parent cell discussed above, so it also represents a quasi-unit cell. The transformation from the modulated parent cell to this subsection is a ′=a − b , b ′=a + b , and c′=c . Or, the transformation from the actual unit cell to this subsection is a ′=a /2− b /3, b ′=a /2+ b /3, and c′=c . In Figs. 1 and 4 an oriented arrow points toward symmetry equivalent anions, allowing the orientation of the sub-unit cell of Fig. 4 to be visualized with respect to the unit cell of Fig. 1.

The relationships between the fictional Fm3̄m aristotype and the reported structures of the (TMAs)2CoCl4 family are explicitly shown by the ascent of symmetry diagram in Fig. 5 . The space groups of the seven observed structures form the base of the diagram. The other space groups, of intermediate symmetry between those of the observed structures and the fictional aristotype, form paths of minimal supergroups. For each of these intermediate space groups, as well as for the aristotype group, hypothetical structures can be discussed in terms of the required site symmetries of their constituent ions (derived below). In this respect it is convenient to separate the space groups into two classes: those (observed or hypothetical) in which the ions occupy sites with symmetry of Td parentage (starred in Fig. 5) or, conversely, those in which the occupied sites have point group symmetry not subgroup related to Td. In fact, space groups for the latter case (no star) all require centers of inversion at some or all of the hypothetical anion sites. Thus, the space groups indicated by asterisks are the most plausible candidates for the higher temperature phases of the observed structures.

In regard to these alternate paths of ascent it may be noted that there are no plausible supergroups of C42/mcd (P42/mbc), the space group of the room temperature phase structures of (TMAs)2ZnCl4 and (TMAs)2CoCl4. Instead, the tentative space group assigned to both of these salts above the transition at ≈337K is I41/a, a site-compatible space group, but one not related to P42/mbc in any direct supergroup or subgroup manner. Thus, the associated first order phase transition observed for these two salts can be understood based on the assumption that the ions will remain in sites of symmetry with Td parentage.

Fig. 6(a)–(d) further detail the various paths of symmetry shown in Fig. 5. Each gives the paths of symmetry starting with the space group of observed or suspected structures, passing through all site-compatible higher symmetry space groups and finishing with the Fm3m space group of the fictional pseudo-antifluorite aristotype structure.

The ascent of symmetry diagrammatic method has been chosen over the more conventional descent of symmetry method to allow the explicit notation of all the additional generators needed to produce the minimal supergroups G from H. By ascending in symmetry, the added generators are expressed in the basis of H, often the basis of a larger unit cell than that of G. An example shows the advantage: addition of T(1/2, 0, 0) to F 4 ̄ 3c obviously leads to the additional lattice points necessary to produce the eight primitive P 4 ̄ 3m unit cells from each F 4 ̄ 3c unit cell. Conversely, the descent of symmetry from P 4 ̄ 3m to F 4 ̄ 3c would be difficult to express symbolically in the basis of the smaller P 4 ̄ 3m unit cell.

With respect to the analysis of (TMP)2CoC14, (TMSb)2ZnBr4 and (TMSb)2CuCl4 as modulated structures, as discussed above, the space groups of the unmodulated parent structures can be obtained directly from Fig. 6(d) and 6(a). The unmodulated parent space group of (TMP)2CoCl4 is Pnmm with axes of a′≈9.193Å, b′≈8.378Å, and c′≈12.758Å. The unmodulated parent space group of (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 is P 4 ̄ 3m with a′≈12.511Å and a′≈12.984Å, respectively.

As mentioned above, the site symmetries of the constituent ions of the hypothetical pseudo-antifluorite structure can be determined. The determined site symmetries of the ions are listed in Table 4 along with their Wyckoff positions as listed in the International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. A. [10]. The listed ion positions are uniquely determined, within a trivial change of origin, by the observed positions of the ions of the known structures in conjunction with the assumption that the structures will tend toward the pseudo-antifluorite structure with increasing symmetry. In particular, the special sets of anion positions of the I4l/a structures of (TMAs)2CoCl4 and (TMAs)2ZnCl4, believed to occur above T≈337K, are predicted uniquely.

The room temperature structures of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4, and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 have been determined. All three salts can be considered as commensurately modulated structures, and, for the latter two, a 3+1 dimensional superspace group has been assigned.

These structures, as well as the room temperature and hypothesized higher temperature structures of (TMAs)2CoCl4 and (TMAs)2ZnCl4, have been correlated by an ascent of symmetry diagram with a fictitious Fm 3 ̄ m aristotype. Based on lattice parameters obtained at room temperature, the other (TMPn)2 MX 4 compounds of the (TMAs)2CoCl4 family can also be assumed to have distorted pseudo-antifluorite structures.

Lists of observed and calculated structure factors, anisotropic thermal parameters, and hydrogen atom coordinates for the three structures are available from the authors.

Title:
Effects of additions of carbon nanotubes on the thermoelectric properties of Ni

Abstract:
To prepare Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6, the starting materials were loaded in the stoichiometric ratio into silica tubes and then heated at 1000K. The reaction products were mixed and divided into four equal parts. The first sample was used as a reference sample called bulk. For the remaining samples, 1%, 2% and 3% by mass of MWCNT (multi-wall carbon nanotubes) were added by ball-milling. These materials were then subjected to consolidation by hot-pressing at 850K and 56MPa. Their transport properties were determined and compared to study the influence of MWCNT on the transport properties of Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the microstructural and nanostructural features of the samples, and Raman characterization was performed to look for changes induced by ball-milling and hot-pressing of the nanotubes. Mainly due to a largely reduced thermal conductivity by 40% and a slightly reduced power factor, the figure-of-merit was improved by 25% after addition of 3mass% of MWCNT.

Introduction:
Energy crisis and thermal management are two of the most hotly debated topics today. Most of our energy comes from fossil fuels which are non-renewable, and technology associated with renewable energy generation such as solar is yet to mature, evolving very slowly. As fossil fuel reserves are limited, it is very important to use these very efficiently.
Thermoelectric materials can convert a temperature difference between two ends of the material into electrical energy. As such these materials can be used to scavenge heat that is generated in fossil fuel engines and convert that to useful energy. When a temperature difference of ΔT exists between two ends of thermoelectric material, charge carriers move from the hot side of the material to the cold side, generating a potential difference ΔV. This phenomenon is called Seebeck effect [1]. The ratio −ΔV/ΔT is defined as the Seebeck coefficient: S=−ΔV/ΔT.
The overall efficiency of a thermoelectric material is related to its dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT, which is defined as ZT=TS 2 σκ −1 where S, σ, κ, and T indicate Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and absolute temperature, respectively. The total thermal conductivity κ has two parts and is given by κ=κ l +κ e , where κ l and κ e are the contributions from the phonons and charge carriers, respectively. According to the above equation, the best thermoelectric material should have a high Seebeck coefficient, high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity [2,3]. Previously our group reported the antimonide-telluride Ni0.06Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6 with ZT max (1050K)=0.93 [4], however at room temperature this material has a relatively high κ of 5.4Wm−1 K−1. Hence a challenge is to decrease the thermal conductivity and thereby improve ZT.
Progress in nanotechnology tools ushered a new dimension to thermoelectric materials [5,6]. Several articles have reported improvements in the transport properties of existing thermoelectric materials by synthesizing nanocomposites [7–12]. A plethora of literature proves that in composites, nanoinclusions and grain boundaries not only scatter phonons but also scatter charge carriers thus reducing charge carrier mobility [13,14]. However, with the optimum amount of nanoinclusions, it may be possible to enhance phonon scattering while simultaneously preserving the electrical conductivity [8].
Multi-wall carbon nanotubes (for brevity we used CNT instead of MWCNT in the subsequent discussion) are known to have to outstanding electrical and mechanical properties [15,16]. For example, in the p-type bismuth antimony telluride (Bi0.2Sb0.8)2Te3, ZT increased by 42% after adding CNT [17], while ZT of MnSi1.75Ge0.02 was enhanced by 20% [18]. In this study, we used CNT with the aim of achieving good electrical properties, reduced thermal conductivity and thermally stable composites.

Experimental Section:
2.1 Synthesis First we synthesized the bulk material Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6 with the starting materials obtained from Alfa Aesar: Ni powder, −100+2000mesh, 99% nominal purity; Mo powder, −100mesh, 99.95%; Sb powder, −100mesh, 99.5%; Te powder, −325mesh, 99.8%. CNT were produced using chemical vapor deposition. The outer diameters of the tubes were 20–50nm, and the lengths were ~10μm. The tubes were used without purification. All these materials were stored in a glove box filled with argon. The starting materials were weighed according to the required stoichiometry in a glove box and transferred to silica tubes. These were then subjected to vacuuming and sealing using an oxygen–hydrogen torch. Three parallel reactions with 4.6g each were carried out by heating the silica tubes with 1.5Kmin−1 to 1000K. The tubes were annealed at 1000K for ten days and then cooled down to room temperature at a programmed rate of 1.5Kmin−1. The reaction mixtures were ground and reheated using the same temperature profile to achieve highly pure and homogenous products. Phase purity at this stage was verified using Inel’s X-ray powder diffractometer with position-sensitive detector and CuK α1 radiation. The reaction products were added to one 15ml glass vial in small quantities alternatively until all samples are emptied out. The glass vial was sealed and subjected to high frequency mixing in a Vortex mixer from Fisher Scientific for 20min. This large sample of approximately 13.5g was divided into four equal parts for bulk (no CNT), 1mass% CNT, 2% CNT and 3% CNT. Bulk/CNT composites were prepared using ball-milling, as this method is assumed to disperse the CNT homogeneously inside the bulk matrix. Appropriate amounts of both materials were placed in a 20ml ball-milling bowl from FRITZSCH with 5mm ZrO2 balls and 10ml ethanol. The bowl was subjected to 300 rounds per minute for 20min, followed by drying on a Petri dish. To ascertain the effect of ball-milling alone on physical properties, a part of the bulk sample was ball-milled with the same duration as the other composites and also characterized. Consolidation of these samples was carried out by hot-pressing with a 30t capacity press from Oxy-Gon under argon, applying 56MPa of pressure at 850K for 2h. The so obtained disk-shaped pellets of a diameter of 12.7mm and a height of ~2mm were polished first, and then their densities were measured using the Archimedes principle. The densities are found to be 8.25gcm−3, 8.22gcm−3, 7.97gcm−3, 7.56gcm−3 and 7.08gcm−3 for bulk, ball-milled (BMilled), 1%, 2% and 3% CNT, respectively, giving raise to increasing porosity with increasing CNT content from 5% (bulk) to 17% (3% CNT).
2.2 Characterization Fig. 1 illustrates the XRD patterns of pure Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6 (bulk), ball-milled bulk, Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6/CNT composites and pure CNT obtained after hot-pressing and the transport measurement. The introduction of CNT and the ball-milling did not result in the formation of any new, unwanted, side products. Fig. 2 shows the microstructural analysis of hot-pressed samples. Immediately after the transport property measurements, the pellets were broken and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis using a Zeiss ULTRA Plus SEM coupled with integrated Secondary Electron detector with in-lens mode. The accelerating voltages were adjusted to capture high resolution images. Fig. 2(a)–(d) respectively show SEM images of bulk, 1%, 2% and 3% CNT. Islands of CNT are found to be clustered between the grain boundaries of the particles. (a) and (b) show that both bulk and composites have the same bulk particle sizes (1–2μm); therefore we conclude that ball-milling process itself did not significantly alter the physical properties. Any changes must thus be coming from the CNT additions. To investigate possible changes induced by ball-milling and hot-pressing on CNT, we determined the Raman shifts in pristine CNT and CNT present inside the composites ( Fig. 3). The samples were excited by a source with a wavelength of 633nm, 4mW power and an operational bandwidth from 800 to 2000nm using Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR 800 Raman spectrometer. The disorder-induced D band, occurring between 1330cm−1 and 1360cm−1 in graphitic carbon structures, is expected to be observed in MWCNT [19,20]. This band is attributed to the presence of defects such as vacancies, foreign atoms etc. Comparing the frequencies of the D band for both pristine and composite CNT (1327cm−1 vs. 1328cm−1), we can see that no significant amounts of defects were created during ball-milling or hot-pressing. The same is true for the tangential G band, which remained at 1580cm−1 after ball-milling and hot-pressing. A very minute detailed topographical visualization and the elemental mapping of carbon, molybdenum and antimony were performed on 3% CNT. Elemental mapping was done in energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) configuration. For TEM analysis, the specimen was prepared using Gatan’s Precision Ion Polishing System (PIPS), with an operating voltage of 5kV and an incident angle of 8°. The elemental distributions are shown in Fig. 4. The areas with high C concentration (Fig. 4(b)) show the CNT, while the areas with high Mo and Sb contributions indicate the presence of the bulk material (Fig. 4(c) and (d)). The latter reveal the presence of nanometer size (20–50nm) bulk particles as well. Fig. 5 depicts the sizes and crystallinity of the CNT. At the bottom right of 5 (b), a cross sectional view of a CNT is given: its outer diameter is ~30nm, which matches the specifications provided by the supplier. No evidence for a reaction of the CNT with the bulk materials was found.
2.3 Physical property measurements The disk-shaped pellets were used to measure the thermal properties first, and then they were cut into prismatic bars of 10×2×2mm to measure the electrical properties. All properties were measured to approximately 760K. The thermal diffusivity α was measured under argon using Anter FlashLineTM; thermal conductivity κ was obtained from the product of the measured density and thermal diffusivity and specific heat calculated using rules of mixtures. The Seebeck coefficient, S, and the electrical conductivity, σ, were measured simultaneously in a helium atmosphere using an ULVAC-RIKO ZEM-3 system.

Synthesis:
First we synthesized the bulk material Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6 with the starting materials obtained from Alfa Aesar: Ni powder, −100+2000mesh, 99% nominal purity; Mo powder, −100mesh, 99.95%; Sb powder, −100mesh, 99.5%; Te powder, −325mesh, 99.8%. CNT were produced using chemical vapor deposition. The outer diameters of the tubes were 20–50nm, and the lengths were ~10μm. The tubes were used without purification. All these materials were stored in a glove box filled with argon.

The densities are found to be 8.25gcm−3, 8.22gcm−3, 7.97gcm−3, 7.56gcm−3 and 7.08gcm−3 for bulk, ball-milled (BMilled), 1%, 2% and 3% CNT, respectively, giving raise to increasing porosity with increasing CNT content from 5% (bulk) to 17% (3% CNT).

Characterization:
Fig. 1 illustrates the XRD patterns of pure Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6 (bulk), ball-milled bulk, Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6/CNT composites and pure CNT obtained after hot-pressing and the transport measurement. The introduction of CNT and the ball-milling did not result in the formation of any new, unwanted, side products.
Fig. 2 shows the microstructural analysis of hot-pressed samples. Immediately after the transport property measurements, the pellets were broken and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis using a Zeiss ULTRA Plus SEM coupled with integrated Secondary Electron detector with in-lens mode. The accelerating voltages were adjusted to capture high resolution images. Fig. 2(a)–(d) respectively show SEM images of bulk, 1%, 2% and 3% CNT. Islands of CNT are found to be clustered between the grain boundaries of the particles. (a) and (b) show that both bulk and composites have the same bulk particle sizes (1–2μm); therefore we conclude that ball-milling process itself did not significantly alter the physical properties. Any changes must thus be coming from the CNT additions.
To investigate possible changes induced by ball-milling and hot-pressing on CNT, we determined the Raman shifts in pristine CNT and CNT present inside the composites ( Fig. 3). The samples were excited by a source with a wavelength of 633nm, 4mW power and an operational bandwidth from 800 to 2000nm using Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR 800 Raman spectrometer. The disorder-induced D band, occurring between 1330cm−1 and 1360cm−1 in graphitic carbon structures, is expected to be observed in MWCNT [19,20]. This band is attributed to the presence of defects such as vacancies, foreign atoms etc. Comparing the frequencies of the D band for both pristine and composite CNT (1327cm−1 vs. 1328cm−1), we can see that no significant amounts of defects were created during ball-milling or hot-pressing. The same is true for the tangential G band, which remained at 1580cm−1 after ball-milling and hot-pressing.
A very minute detailed topographical visualization and the elemental mapping of carbon, molybdenum and antimony were performed on 3% CNT. Elemental mapping was done in energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) configuration. For TEM analysis, the specimen was prepared using Gatan’s Precision Ion Polishing System (PIPS), with an operating voltage of 5kV and an incident angle of 8°.
The elemental distributions are shown in Fig. 4. The areas with high C concentration (Fig. 4(b)) show the CNT, while the areas with high Mo and Sb contributions indicate the presence of the bulk material (Fig. 4(c) and (d)). The latter reveal the presence of nanometer size (20–50nm) bulk particles as well.
Fig. 5 depicts the sizes and crystallinity of the CNT. At the bottom right of 5 (b), a cross sectional view of a CNT is given: its outer diameter is ~30nm, which matches the specifications provided by the supplier. No evidence for a reaction of the CNT with the bulk materials was found.

Physical Property Measurements:
The disk-shaped pellets were used to measure the thermal properties first, and then they were cut into prismatic bars of 10×2×2mm to measure the electrical properties. All properties were measured to approximately 760K. The thermal diffusivity α was measured under argon using Anter FlashLineTM; thermal conductivity κ was obtained from the product of the measured density and thermal diffusivity and specific heat calculated using rules of mixtures. The Seebeck coefficient, S, and the electrical conductivity, σ, were measured simultaneously in a helium atmosphere using an ULVAC-RIKO ZEM-3 system.

Results And Discussion:
Previously we reported the charge carrier concentration of Ni0.06Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6 to be around 4×1021 cm−3 [21]. Typically, these materials exhibit high electrical conductivity, moderate Seebeck coefficient and relatively high thermal conductivity. The electrical conductivity of our bulk sample without CNT decreases from σ=1400Ω−1 cm−1 at 325K to 950Ω−1 cm−1 at 760K ( Fig. 6(a)), displaying the expected behavior. The conductivity of the ball-milled sample is insignificantly higher, and appears to follow the same temperature dependence, roughly proportional to T −3/2 below 700K. This temperature dependence is indicative of dominant phonon scattering if the carrier concentration remains constant, as observed before. As the content of the CNT increases, there is a systematic reduction in the conductivity, as well as a reduction in the temperature dependence, i.e. the curves become flatter with increasing CNT content approaching a T −1/2 dependence. Both reductions can be explained with increased scattering at the increasing interfaces with CNT and the pores.
For the composites at 325K, the electrical conductivity values range from σ=1311Ω−1 cm−1 (1% CNT) to 1204Ω−1 cm−1 (2% CNT) and finally 1105Ω−1 cm−1 (3% CNT). Assuming an experimental error of±5%, the differences are significant. Going beyond 700K, the conductivity starts to flatten mostly likely because of the increasing participation of the intrinsic carriers. Around 760K, the difference between bulk and 3% CNT sample is 150Ω−1 cm−1, which amounts to ~20% difference. To provide an overview, the high temperature data are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
To estimate the porosity effect, we calculated the hypothetical corrected densities of the fully dense samples via the Maxwell–Eucken correction (Eq. (1)) setting the correction factor β=2 as for spherical pores as done by others [22–24]: (1) σ P=σ 0 1 − P 1 + β P with σ P=measured electrical conductivity with a porosity P, and σ 0=theoretical electrical conductivity at full density, i.e. P=0. With porosities of 5% for the bulk and 17% for the 3% CNT composite, we obtain corrected σ 0 values of 1100Ω−1 cm−1 and 1270Ω−1 cm−1 at 760K, respectively. Thusly, the decreases in σ stem mostly from the increased porosity, i.e. the scattering at the pores. In fact, the addition of CNT might have increased the electrical conductivity, if the same relative density could have been obtained.
A similar trend was observed in composites of the same bulk material with C60, but the decreases in the electrical conductivity for bulk/C60 samples were larger compared to the present composites. At 325K, the conductivity values for bulk, 1%, 2% and 3% C60 samples were σ=1475Ω−1 cm−1, 1114Ω−1 cm−1, 826Ω−1 cm−1 and 727Ω−1 cm−1, respectively, and at 665K, the values were 975Ω−1 cm−1, 769Ω−1 cm−1, 588Ω−1 cm−1 and 546Ω−1 cm−1, respectively. Here it should be noted that only a part of these decreases stem from an increased porosity; e.g. the corrected electrical conductivity values at 665K were 1230Ω−1 cm−1 for the bulk and 926Ω−1 cm−1 for the 3% C60 composite. This considerable difference in electrical conductivity between the two composites likely stems from the amorphization of C60 under pressure, while the CNT character remained basically unchanged.
As depicted in Fig. 6(b), all samples investigated here have very similar Seebeck coefficient values, all increasing from about 60μVK−1 at 325K to 130–140μVK−1 at 760K. Evidently the relatively small impact of the increased porosity [23] upon introduction of the CNT on the Seebeck coefficient is canceled by the low Seebeck coefficient of the CNT itself [25], as the overall Seebeck coefficient results from the properties of both the bulk and the nanomaterial as well as the interfaces [26]. On the other hand, the composite Bi2Te3/MWCNT (0.7mass%) exhibits reduced electrical conductivity and significantly enhanced Seebeck coefficient compared to the respective bulk sample [27]. For example at 297K, bulk Bi2Te3 has σ=1380Ω−1 cm−1 and S=−83μVK−1, compared to the Bi2Te3/MWCNT composite with σ=825Ω−1 cm−1 and S=−114μVK−1. For the same material, the Seebeck coefficient increases upon MWCNT addition from −92μVK−1 to −124μVK−1 at 500K mainly because of the decrease in carrier concentration from 8.1×1019 cm−3 to 1.4×1018 cm−3. The same trends were found in (Bi0.2Sb0.8)2Te3/MWCNT composites [17].
The power factor P.F.=S 2 σ increases linearly with temperature (Fig. 6(c)) like the Seebeck coefficient, similar to Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6/C60 [28]. P.F. ranges from 4μWcm−1 K−2 to 5μWcm−1 K−2 at 325K. As the temperature increases, P.F. increases fastest for the bulk and the ball-milled bulk, surpassing 17μWcm−1 K−2 at 760K. For 2% and 3% CNT, P.F. remains below 14μWcm−1 K−2.
The thermal conductivity data are presented in Fig. 7(a). All these samples exhibit the expected negative temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, κ. For example, κ(bulk) decreases from 5.0Wm−1 K−1 at 325K to 4.0Wm−1 K−1 at 760K. Ball-milling did not cause a significant change (assuming an experimental error of±5%), as the κ values of the ball-milled sample without CNT are 5.1Wm−1 K−1 at 325K and 4.0Wm−1 K−1 at 760K. Adding CNT led to a significant reduction in κ, for example down to κ=3.8Wm−1 K−1 at 325K and 2.8Wm−1 K−1 at 760K in case of the 3% CNT sample. These reductions are significantly smaller than in case of our previously reported composites with C60, where the 3% sample showed a reduction from the bulk’s value of κ=5.0Wm−1 K−1 down to 2.5Wm−1 K−1 at 325K [28].
To quantify the effect of porosity on the thermal conductivity, we used the same equation for κ as for σ, namely eq. 2: (2) κ P=κ 0 1 − P 1 + β P with this, we calculated the corrected κ 0=4.6Wm−1 K−1 at 760K for both the bulk sample and the 3% CNT sample. Therefore, the changes in κ also mostly stem from the increased porosity in case of the CNT samples, as was the case for the changes in σ. Again, this was not true for the C60 samples, where κ 0 decreased from κ 0=5.9Wm−1 K−1 for the bulk to κ 0=3.5Wm−1 K−1 for the 3% C60 sample (both at 665K).
The total thermal conductivity κ has contributions from the charge carriers, κ e , and the lattice (phonons), κ l , i.e. κ=κ e +κ l . According to the Wiedemann–Franz law, κ e=L 0 σT, with L 0=Lorenz number; thus κ e may increase with increasing temperature, depending on the slope of σ. κ l typically decreases with increasing temperature because of increasing lattice vibrations. To comprehend the effect of CNT on lattice thermal conductivity, we calculated κ l for all samples by subtracting κ e=L 0 σT from the total thermal conductivity. L 0 was calculated at various temperatures assuming single parabolic model and elastic carrier scattering [29,30], and is presented in the Supplementary information.
As shown in Fig. 7(b), the lattice thermal conductivity decreases with increasing temperature—a clear indication of increased phonon–phonon scattering. Comparing the trends of these composites to previously reported Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6/C60, we can surmise that CNT are also reducing lattice thermal conductivity. Using L 0=2.44×10−8 V2 K−2, we reported a lattice thermal conductivity κ l of 3.6Wm−1 K−1 for bulk and 2.7Wm−1 K−1 for 1% C60 at 325K. Similarly using L 0=2.14×10−8 V2 K−2 in our present bulk, κ l (4.0Wm−1 K−1) is larger than κ e, and for the sample with 1% CNT, κ l is 3.72Wm−1 K−1. Comparing κ l at 325K for both, we can conclude that the phonons are the major carriers of heat in bulk as well in composites.
Finally, we calculated the figure-of-merit ZT=TS 2 σ/κ by applying a polynomial fit to P.F.=S 2 σ, and using κ as directly determined. As typical for members of the Mo3(Sb,Te)7 family [4], ZT rises quickly with increasing temperature (Fig. 7(c)). For the bulk material, ZT increases from 0.035 at 325K to 0.32 at 760K. The ball-milled bulk without CNT behaves very similarly. The CNT additions led in part to improvements (3% CNT: ZT (760K)=0.40), in part to (insignificantly) lower ZT values (2% CNT: ZT(760K)=0.30). At 760K, ZT improves by 25% after adding 3% CNT, because the reduction in thermal conductivity outweighs the reduction in the power factor. For the composites with C60 published in 2013, the ZT values at 665K are 0.22, 0.25, 0.23, and 0.25 for bulk, 1%, 2% and 3% C60, respectively.

Conclusion:
For the first time we have proven that adding CNT may enhance the thermoelectric properties of Mo3(Sb,Te)7 materials. XRD analyses of hot-pressed samples revealed that CNT did not react with the bulk material. Raman characterization of free CNT and of CNT embedded in the bulk sample indicated that ball-milling and hot-pressing did not induce any noticeable defects on CNT. For 3% CNT, the reduction in thermal conductivity at 325K is 33%, compared to 6% for 1% and 2% CNT composites. In case of the 3% CNT sample, this reduction outweighs the impeded electrical performance, ultimately yielding a significant improvement of the figure-of-merit by 25%.
In the future, we intend to investigate the performance and stability of these composites beyond 760K and the effect of using non-graphitic nanotubes (for example Bi nanowires) on the thermoelectric properties. Larger amounts of CNT will be studied as well, noting that the best performance was exhibited by the sample with the currently highest CNT amount.
Apart from ball-milling, we intend to explore other methods to disperse CNT homogeneously to enhance phonon scattering, while simultaneously preserving electrical conductivity as much as possible by embedding metal nanoparticle coated CNT.

Energy crisis and thermal management are two of the most hotly debated topics today. Most of our energy comes from fossil fuels which are non-renewable, and technology associated with renewable energy generation such as solar is yet to mature, evolving very slowly. As fossil fuel reserves are limited, it is very important to use these very efficiently.

Thermoelectric materials can convert a temperature difference between two ends of the material into electrical energy. As such these materials can be used to scavenge heat that is generated in fossil fuel engines and convert that to useful energy. When a temperature difference of ΔT exists between two ends of thermoelectric material, charge carriers move from the hot side of the material to the cold side, generating a potential difference ΔV. This phenomenon is called Seebeck effect [1]. The ratio −ΔV/ΔT is defined as the Seebeck coefficient: S=−ΔV/ΔT.

The overall efficiency of a thermoelectric material is related to its dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT, which is defined as ZT=TS 2 σκ −1 where S, σ, κ, and T indicate Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and absolute temperature, respectively. The total thermal conductivity κ has two parts and is given by κ=κ l +κ e , where κ l and κ e are the contributions from the phonons and charge carriers, respectively. According to the above equation, the best thermoelectric material should have a high Seebeck coefficient, high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity [2,3]. Previously our group reported the antimonide-telluride Ni0.06Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6 with ZT max (1050K)=0.93 [4], however at room temperature this material has a relatively high κ of 5.4Wm−1 K−1. Hence a challenge is to decrease the thermal conductivity and thereby improve ZT.

Progress in nanotechnology tools ushered a new dimension to thermoelectric materials [5,6]. Several articles have reported improvements in the transport properties of existing thermoelectric materials by synthesizing nanocomposites [7–12]. A plethora of literature proves that in composites, nanoinclusions and grain boundaries not only scatter phonons but also scatter charge carriers thus reducing charge carrier mobility [13,14]. However, with the optimum amount of nanoinclusions, it may be possible to enhance phonon scattering while simultaneously preserving the electrical conductivity [8].

Multi-wall carbon nanotubes (for brevity we used CNT instead of MWCNT in the subsequent discussion) are known to have to outstanding electrical and mechanical properties [15,16]. For example, in the p-type bismuth antimony telluride (Bi0.2Sb0.8)2Te3, ZT increased by 42% after adding CNT [17], while ZT of MnSi1.75Ge0.02 was enhanced by 20% [18]. In this study, we used CNT with the aim of achieving good electrical properties, reduced thermal conductivity and thermally stable composites.

First we synthesized the bulk material Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6 with the starting materials obtained from Alfa Aesar: Ni powder, −100+2000mesh, 99% nominal purity; Mo powder, −100mesh, 99.95%; Sb powder, −100mesh, 99.5%; Te powder, −325mesh, 99.8%. CNT were produced using chemical vapor deposition. The outer diameters of the tubes were 20–50nm, and the lengths were ~10μm. The tubes were used without purification. All these materials were stored in a glove box filled with argon.

The starting materials were weighed according to the required stoichiometry in a glove box and transferred to silica tubes. These were then subjected to vacuuming and sealing using an oxygen–hydrogen torch. Three parallel reactions with 4.6g each were carried out by heating the silica tubes with 1.5Kmin−1 to 1000K. The tubes were annealed at 1000K for ten days and then cooled down to room temperature at a programmed rate of 1.5Kmin−1. The reaction mixtures were ground and reheated using the same temperature profile to achieve highly pure and homogenous products. Phase purity at this stage was verified using Inel’s X-ray powder diffractometer with position-sensitive detector and CuK α1 radiation.

The reaction products were added to one 15ml glass vial in small quantities alternatively until all samples are emptied out. The glass vial was sealed and subjected to high frequency mixing in a Vortex mixer from Fisher Scientific for 20min. This large sample of approximately 13.5g was divided into four equal parts for bulk (no CNT), 1mass% CNT, 2% CNT and 3% CNT. Bulk/CNT composites were prepared using ball-milling, as this method is assumed to disperse the CNT homogeneously inside the bulk matrix. Appropriate amounts of both materials were placed in a 20ml ball-milling bowl from FRITZSCH with 5mm ZrO2 balls and 10ml ethanol. The bowl was subjected to 300 rounds per minute for 20min, followed by drying on a Petri dish. To ascertain the effect of ball-milling alone on physical properties, a part of the bulk sample was ball-milled with the same duration as the other composites and also characterized.

Consolidation of these samples was carried out by hot-pressing with a 30t capacity press from Oxy-Gon under argon, applying 56MPa of pressure at 850K for 2h. The so obtained disk-shaped pellets of a diameter of 12.7mm and a height of ~2mm were polished first, and then their densities were measured using the Archimedes principle. The densities are found to be 8.25gcm−3, 8.22gcm−3, 7.97gcm−3, 7.56gcm−3 and 7.08gcm−3 for bulk, ball-milled (BMilled), 1%, 2% and 3% CNT, respectively, giving raise to increasing porosity with increasing CNT content from 5% (bulk) to 17% (3% CNT).

Fig. 1 illustrates the XRD patterns of pure Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6 (bulk), ball-milled bulk, Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6/CNT composites and pure CNT obtained after hot-pressing and the transport measurement. The introduction of CNT and the ball-milling did not result in the formation of any new, unwanted, side products.

Fig. 2 shows the microstructural analysis of hot-pressed samples. Immediately after the transport property measurements, the pellets were broken and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis using a Zeiss ULTRA Plus SEM coupled with integrated Secondary Electron detector with in-lens mode. The accelerating voltages were adjusted to capture high resolution images. Fig. 2(a)–(d) respectively show SEM images of bulk, 1%, 2% and 3% CNT. Islands of CNT are found to be clustered between the grain boundaries of the particles. (a) and (b) show that both bulk and composites have the same bulk particle sizes (1–2μm); therefore we conclude that ball-milling process itself did not significantly alter the physical properties. Any changes must thus be coming from the CNT additions.

To investigate possible changes induced by ball-milling and hot-pressing on CNT, we determined the Raman shifts in pristine CNT and CNT present inside the composites ( Fig. 3). The samples were excited by a source with a wavelength of 633nm, 4mW power and an operational bandwidth from 800 to 2000nm using Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR 800 Raman spectrometer. The disorder-induced D band, occurring between 1330cm−1 and 1360cm−1 in graphitic carbon structures, is expected to be observed in MWCNT [19,20]. This band is attributed to the presence of defects such as vacancies, foreign atoms etc. Comparing the frequencies of the D band for both pristine and composite CNT (1327cm−1 vs. 1328cm−1), we can see that no significant amounts of defects were created during ball-milling or hot-pressing. The same is true for the tangential G band, which remained at 1580cm−1 after ball-milling and hot-pressing.

A very minute detailed topographical visualization and the elemental mapping of carbon, molybdenum and antimony were performed on 3% CNT. Elemental mapping was done in energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) configuration. For TEM analysis, the specimen was prepared using Gatan’s Precision Ion Polishing System (PIPS), with an operating voltage of 5kV and an incident angle of 8°.

The elemental distributions are shown in Fig. 4. The areas with high C concentration (Fig. 4(b)) show the CNT, while the areas with high Mo and Sb contributions indicate the presence of the bulk material (Fig. 4(c) and (d)). The latter reveal the presence of nanometer size (20–50nm) bulk particles as well.

Fig. 5 depicts the sizes and crystallinity of the CNT. At the bottom right of 5 (b), a cross sectional view of a CNT is given: its outer diameter is ~30nm, which matches the specifications provided by the supplier. No evidence for a reaction of the CNT with the bulk materials was found.

The disk-shaped pellets were used to measure the thermal properties first, and then they were cut into prismatic bars of 10×2×2mm to measure the electrical properties. All properties were measured to approximately 760K. The thermal diffusivity α was measured under argon using Anter FlashLineTM; thermal conductivity κ was obtained from the product of the measured density and thermal diffusivity and specific heat calculated using rules of mixtures. The Seebeck coefficient, S, and the electrical conductivity, σ, were measured simultaneously in a helium atmosphere using an ULVAC-RIKO ZEM-3 system.

Previously we reported the charge carrier concentration of Ni0.06Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6 to be around 4×1021 cm−3 [21]. Typically, these materials exhibit high electrical conductivity, moderate Seebeck coefficient and relatively high thermal conductivity. The electrical conductivity of our bulk sample without CNT decreases from σ=1400Ω−1 cm−1 at 325K to 950Ω−1 cm−1 at 760K ( Fig. 6(a)), displaying the expected behavior. The conductivity of the ball-milled sample is insignificantly higher, and appears to follow the same temperature dependence, roughly proportional to T −3/2 below 700K. This temperature dependence is indicative of dominant phonon scattering if the carrier concentration remains constant, as observed before. As the content of the CNT increases, there is a systematic reduction in the conductivity, as well as a reduction in the temperature dependence, i.e. the curves become flatter with increasing CNT content approaching a T −1/2 dependence. Both reductions can be explained with increased scattering at the increasing interfaces with CNT and the pores.

For the composites at 325K, the electrical conductivity values range from σ=1311Ω−1 cm−1 (1% CNT) to 1204Ω−1 cm−1 (2% CNT) and finally 1105Ω−1 cm−1 (3% CNT). Assuming an experimental error of±5%, the differences are significant. Going beyond 700K, the conductivity starts to flatten mostly likely because of the increasing participation of the intrinsic carriers. Around 760K, the difference between bulk and 3% CNT sample is 150Ω−1 cm−1, which amounts to ~20% difference. To provide an overview, the high temperature data are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

To estimate the porosity effect, we calculated the hypothetical corrected densities of the fully dense samples via the Maxwell–Eucken correction (Eq. (1)) setting the correction factor β=2 as for spherical pores as done by others [22–24]: (1) σ P=σ 0 1 − P 1 + β P with σ P=measured electrical conductivity with a porosity P, and σ 0=theoretical electrical conductivity at full density, i.e. P=0. With porosities of 5% for the bulk and 17% for the 3% CNT composite, we obtain corrected σ 0 values of 1100Ω−1 cm−1 and 1270Ω−1 cm−1 at 760K, respectively. Thusly, the decreases in σ stem mostly from the increased porosity, i.e. the scattering at the pores. In fact, the addition of CNT might have increased the electrical conductivity, if the same relative density could have been obtained.

A similar trend was observed in composites of the same bulk material with C60, but the decreases in the electrical conductivity for bulk/C60 samples were larger compared to the present composites. At 325K, the conductivity values for bulk, 1%, 2% and 3% C60 samples were σ=1475Ω−1 cm−1, 1114Ω−1 cm−1, 826Ω−1 cm−1 and 727Ω−1 cm−1, respectively, and at 665K, the values were 975Ω−1 cm−1, 769Ω−1 cm−1, 588Ω−1 cm−1 and 546Ω−1 cm−1, respectively. Here it should be noted that only a part of these decreases stem from an increased porosity; e.g. the corrected electrical conductivity values at 665K were 1230Ω−1 cm−1 for the bulk and 926Ω−1 cm−1 for the 3% C60 composite. This considerable difference in electrical conductivity between the two composites likely stems from the amorphization of C60 under pressure, while the CNT character remained basically unchanged.

As depicted in Fig. 6(b), all samples investigated here have very similar Seebeck coefficient values, all increasing from about 60μVK−1 at 325K to 130–140μVK−1 at 760K. Evidently the relatively small impact of the increased porosity [23] upon introduction of the CNT on the Seebeck coefficient is canceled by the low Seebeck coefficient of the CNT itself [25], as the overall Seebeck coefficient results from the properties of both the bulk and the nanomaterial as well as the interfaces [26]. On the other hand, the composite Bi2Te3/MWCNT (0.7mass%) exhibits reduced electrical conductivity and significantly enhanced Seebeck coefficient compared to the respective bulk sample [27]. For example at 297K, bulk Bi2Te3 has σ=1380Ω−1 cm−1 and S=−83μVK−1, compared to the Bi2Te3/MWCNT composite with σ=825Ω−1 cm−1 and S=−114μVK−1. For the same material, the Seebeck coefficient increases upon MWCNT addition from −92μVK−1 to −124μVK−1 at 500K mainly because of the decrease in carrier concentration from 8.1×1019 cm−3 to 1.4×1018 cm−3. The same trends were found in (Bi0.2Sb0.8)2Te3/MWCNT composites [17].

The power factor P.F.=S 2 σ increases linearly with temperature (Fig. 6(c)) like the Seebeck coefficient, similar to Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6/C60 [28]. P.F. ranges from 4μWcm−1 K−2 to 5μWcm−1 K−2 at 325K. As the temperature increases, P.F. increases fastest for the bulk and the ball-milled bulk, surpassing 17μWcm−1 K−2 at 760K. For 2% and 3% CNT, P.F. remains below 14μWcm−1 K−2.

The thermal conductivity data are presented in Fig. 7(a). All these samples exhibit the expected negative temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, κ. For example, κ(bulk) decreases from 5.0Wm−1 K−1 at 325K to 4.0Wm−1 K−1 at 760K. Ball-milling did not cause a significant change (assuming an experimental error of±5%), as the κ values of the ball-milled sample without CNT are 5.1Wm−1 K−1 at 325K and 4.0Wm−1 K−1 at 760K. Adding CNT led to a significant reduction in κ, for example down to κ=3.8Wm−1 K−1 at 325K and 2.8Wm−1 K−1 at 760K in case of the 3% CNT sample. These reductions are significantly smaller than in case of our previously reported composites with C60, where the 3% sample showed a reduction from the bulk’s value of κ=5.0Wm−1 K−1 down to 2.5Wm−1 K−1 at 325K [28].

To quantify the effect of porosity on the thermal conductivity, we used the same equation for κ as for σ, namely eq. 2: (2) κ P=κ 0 1 − P 1 + β P with this, we calculated the corrected κ 0=4.6Wm−1 K−1 at 760K for both the bulk sample and the 3% CNT sample. Therefore, the changes in κ also mostly stem from the increased porosity in case of the CNT samples, as was the case for the changes in σ. Again, this was not true for the C60 samples, where κ 0 decreased from κ 0=5.9Wm−1 K−1 for the bulk to κ 0=3.5Wm−1 K−1 for the 3% C60 sample (both at 665K).

The total thermal conductivity κ has contributions from the charge carriers, κ e , and the lattice (phonons), κ l , i.e. κ=κ e +κ l . According to the Wiedemann–Franz law, κ e=L 0 σT, with L 0=Lorenz number; thus κ e may increase with increasing temperature, depending on the slope of σ. κ l typically decreases with increasing temperature because of increasing lattice vibrations. To comprehend the effect of CNT on lattice thermal conductivity, we calculated κ l for all samples by subtracting κ e=L 0 σT from the total thermal conductivity. L 0 was calculated at various temperatures assuming single parabolic model and elastic carrier scattering [29,30], and is presented in the Supplementary information.

As shown in Fig. 7(b), the lattice thermal conductivity decreases with increasing temperature—a clear indication of increased phonon–phonon scattering. Comparing the trends of these composites to previously reported Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6/C60, we can surmise that CNT are also reducing lattice thermal conductivity. Using L 0=2.44×10−8 V2 K−2, we reported a lattice thermal conductivity κ l of 3.6Wm−1 K−1 for bulk and 2.7Wm−1 K−1 for 1% C60 at 325K. Similarly using L 0=2.14×10−8 V2 K−2 in our present bulk, κ l (4.0Wm−1 K−1) is larger than κ e, and for the sample with 1% CNT, κ l is 3.72Wm−1 K−1. Comparing κ l at 325K for both, we can conclude that the phonons are the major carriers of heat in bulk as well in composites.

Finally, we calculated the figure-of-merit ZT=TS 2 σ/κ by applying a polynomial fit to P.F.=S 2 σ, and using κ as directly determined. As typical for members of the Mo3(Sb,Te)7 family [4], ZT rises quickly with increasing temperature (Fig. 7(c)). For the bulk material, ZT increases from 0.035 at 325K to 0.32 at 760K. The ball-milled bulk without CNT behaves very similarly. The CNT additions led in part to improvements (3% CNT: ZT (760K)=0.40), in part to (insignificantly) lower ZT values (2% CNT: ZT(760K)=0.30). At 760K, ZT improves by 25% after adding 3% CNT, because the reduction in thermal conductivity outweighs the reduction in the power factor. For the composites with C60 published in 2013, the ZT values at 665K are 0.22, 0.25, 0.23, and 0.25 for bulk, 1%, 2% and 3% C60, respectively.

For the first time we have proven that adding CNT may enhance the thermoelectric properties of Mo3(Sb,Te)7 materials. XRD analyses of hot-pressed samples revealed that CNT did not react with the bulk material. Raman characterization of free CNT and of CNT embedded in the bulk sample indicated that ball-milling and hot-pressing did not induce any noticeable defects on CNT. For 3% CNT, the reduction in thermal conductivity at 325K is 33%, compared to 6% for 1% and 2% CNT composites. In case of the 3% CNT sample, this reduction outweighs the impeded electrical performance, ultimately yielding a significant improvement of the figure-of-merit by 25%.

In the future, we intend to investigate the performance and stability of these composites beyond 760K and the effect of using non-graphitic nanotubes (for example Bi nanowires) on the thermoelectric properties. Larger amounts of CNT will be studied as well, noting that the best performance was exhibited by the sample with the currently highest CNT amount.

Apart from ball-milling, we intend to explore other methods to disperse CNT homogeneously to enhance phonon scattering, while simultaneously preserving electrical conductivity as much as possible by embedding metal nanoparticle coated CNT.

Abstract:
Ligand-to-metal charge transfer energies of YBO3:Eu have been investigated from the chemical bond viewpoint. The chemical bond parameters, such as the covalency, the polarizability of the chemical bond volume, and the presented charge of the ligands in the chemical bond have been quantitatively determined based on the dielectric theory of complex crystal. We calculated the environmental factor (h e), which is the major factor influencing the charge transfer energy in the compounds. The calculated results show that the suitable group space of YBO3 is C2/c.

Coordinating atoms of Y1 and Y2 in the crystal YBO3 with the space group C2/c are represented as following:

Introduction:
Rare earth orthoborates LnBO3 (Ln=rare earth) are an interesting class of inorganic compounds [1]. Over the last several decades, particular attention has been paid to these materials because of their high UV transparency and exceptional optical damage threshold [2–13]. However, the crystallographic structures of LnBO3 have not been clearly identified.
LnBO3 is compositionally the simplest compound in the borate systems. The crystal structure determination, however, is far more complicated [1–3,10]. The difficulty of precisely defining the crystal structure of these compounds originates mainly from the weak scattering power of boron and oxygen atoms for X-rays [2]. Depending on the size of the rare earth ion, the orthoborates crystallize with the aragonite, vaterite, or calcite type structure [1]. For the smallest rare earth ions (from Sm to Lu) and Y, the orthoborates possess the vaterite structure. It is the most controversial structure among the orthoborate structures.
Until now, seven main crystallographic structures of the vaterite-type orthoborate at room temperature have been determined. The essential crystallographic data are summarized in Table 1.
In Table 1, Structure I is proposed by Bartram and Felten [14]. They choose P63/mmc with Z=2. Newnham et al. proposed two possible structure models, a disordered hexagonal (P63/mmc) structure and an ordered hexagonal (P63/mcm) structure [2]. They are shown as Structures II and III in Table 1. A common feature of these structural models above is that the borate group was assumed to be in triangular geometry (BO3)3−. However, later spectroscopic studies using IR, NMR, and Raman techniques all indicated that these compounds contain only the trimeric ion with three-membered rings of borate tetrahedron as (B3O9)3− [5,8,15].
Structure IV, which is proposed by Bradley et al., differs from the structures mentioned above in involving a trimeric ion with 4-coordinate boron [3]. Their model is found to be reconcilable with the optical properties, and the infrared absorption character. Although the model is reasonable as for its physical characters, it has not received enough attention.
Recently Chadeyron et al. reinvestigated the structure of YBO3 using the single-crystal X-ray diffraction technique [8]. It is named structure V, as shown in Table 1. The structure is most likely to be more accurate than the structure derived from powder diffraction in 1963. They describe the structure in a hexagonal cell with the space group P63/m. In this structure model the boron position and one oxygen position are partially occupied, and physically, this implied a rotational distortion of the B3O9 9− group. With regard to the large anion size, it is unlikely that the B3O9 9− group is rotationally distorted in this solid-state structure [12].
By using powder X-ray and electron diffraction techniques, Ren et al. found super-reflections corresponding to a rhombohedral space group R32 with lattice constants a=6.6357Å and c=20.706Å, for GdBO3 [10]. In this structural model, the Ln3+ occupies only one site. However, recent studies on the charge transfer bands indicated that at least two different types of intrinsic luminescent sites coexist in YBO3:Eu [7,11,16,17]. Well then structures V and VI are not in agreement with this experimental phenomenon because they have only one luminescent site.
Very recently, Lin et al. proposed structure VII from the neutron powder diffraction data [12]. In their work, the crystal structure of the vaterite-type rare earth orthoborate (Y0.92Er0.08)BO3 was refined as the space group C2/c.
A parallel effort to characterize the vaterite-type rare earth orthoborate has been undertaken through the extensive spectroscopic investigations [5–8,17,18]. In addition to previous IR, Raman and 11B NMR experiments, which confirm the three-member ring B3O9 9− borate unit [4,5,8], the recent spectroscopic study is mainly focused on the cation sites [6,7,9,11,17,18]. To verify the crystallographic results, several analyses of the luminescence spectra of Eu3+-doped materials were carried out with the view of monitoring the local symmetry of the rare earth atoms. However, the high resolution luminescence spectra reveal a difficulty in unambiguously distinguishing between the alternatives of having either two [6,7] or three [9] cation sites in the structure. Therefore, structures IV and VII in Table 1 are very difficult to be distinguished which one is more reasonable even using IR, NMR, Raman techniques and other experimental techniques. To clarify the structure of the vaterite-type orthoborate, another method is necessary.
In the excitation or absorption spectra, some broad bands are attributed to the charge transfer (CT) transitions, in which an electron is excited from a delocalized ligand molecular orbital to an empty or incompletely filled orbital mainly localized on the central ion of the chromophore. In Eu-doped compounds the CT bands are very sensitive to the composition and the structure of the crystal [19–28]. CT bands have been recognized as determining the different types of intrinsic luminescent sites [11,29,30]. Furthermore, the quantitative relationship expression between the CT energy and the structural composition of the crystal in Eu3+-doped compounds has been established in our previous paper [23]. It indicates that CT energy is strongly influenced by the environmental factor (h e). The CT energy of YBO3:Eu can be predicted using the quantitative relationship expression. By comparison of the experimental CT energy of YBO3:Eu [11,17,31] with the predicted CT energies, the proper structure of YBO3 can be distinguished from the various probable space groups.
In this paper, the ligand-to-metal CT energies of YBO3:Eu have been investigated from the chemical bond viewpoint. The chemical bond parameters between the cation and the ligands have been quantitatively determined based on the dielectric theory of complex crystal. This theory is the extension of the theory developed by Phillips, Van Vechten and Levine (PVL) [32,33]. The dielectric theory for the complex crystal has been successfully applied in a variety of research fields, such as nonlinear optical crystal [34–36], high Tc oxides [37], hardness of the covalent crystal [38,39] and so forth. According to all of the possible space groups of the vaterite-type orthoborate, the values of the CT energies in Eu-doped YBO3 were predicted. The method provides us with a supplementary tool to judge the proper structure when the structure of the crystal has many uncertain space groups.

Theoretical Method:
The quantitative relationship between the CT energy (in eV) and the environmental factor (h e) can be expressed as follows [23]: (1) E CT=A + B × exp ( − k × h e ) , where A=2.804, B=6.924, and k=1.256 for Eu3+ ion. The environmental factor (h e) [23,40,41] in Eq. (1) can be expressed as (2) h e=( ∑ μ f c μ α b μ Q B μ 2 ) 1 / 2 , where f c μ is the covalency for any individual bond μ surrounding the center ion in a multibond crystal, α b μ is the polarizability of the ligand bond volume in the type-μ bond (in Å3), and Q B μ stands for the presented charge of the ligands in the chemical bond of the type μ.
In order to calculate the chemical bond parameters above, the complex crystal firstly should be decomposed into a sum of the binary crystals using the bond-valence equation [36,39,42,43]. In the equation any binary crystal includes only one type of the chemical bond, but the properties of these binary crystals are different from those of a real corresponding binary crystal, although its chemical bond parameters can be calculated in a similar way. When detailed information of the crystal structure is given, the sub-formula equation (the bond-valence equation) of the crystal can be obtained according to the crystal formula. Suppose A denotes cations and B anions, any multibond complex crystal can be written as A a 1 1 A a 2 2 ⋯ A a i i B b 1 1 B b 2 2 ⋯ B b j j , where A a i i , B b j j stand for the different constituent elements or different sites of the same element in the crystal formula, and a i , b j represent the number of the corresponding element. The sub-formula of any type of chemical bond A–B can be expressed by the following formula: (3) N ( B j − A i ) × a i N CA i A i N ( A i − B j ) × b j N CB j B j=A m i i B n j j , where m i=N ( B j − A i ) × a i N CA i , n j=N ( A i − B j ) × b j N CB j .
And the bond sub-formula equation is given by (4) A a 1 1 A a 2 2 ⋯ A a i i B b 1 1 B b 2 2 ⋯ B b j j=∑ i , j A m i i B n j j , where N ( B j − A i ) is the number of B j ions in the coordination group of an A i ion, and N CA i represents the nearest coordination number of A i ion. Then, the complex crystal is decomposed into the sum of the different binary crystals like A m i i B n j j . Therefore, the presented charge Q B μ of each anion can be obtained according to the neutral principle of the binary crystals as the equation Q B=m Q A / n .
According to the PVL [32,33] theory the fractional covalency f c μ for any individual bond μ in the multibond crystal can be defined as follows: (5) f c μ=( E h μ ) 2 / ( E g μ ) 2 , where E g μ is the average energy band gap between the bonding and antibonding status (in eV). ( E g μ ) 2 can be separated into homopolar ( E h μ ) 2 and heteropolar ( C μ ) 2 parts in analogy with the work of PVL theory. Thus, (6) ( E g μ ) 2=( E h μ ) 2 + ( C μ ) 2 , where (7) E h μ=39.74 / ( d μ ) 2.48 ( eV ) and d μ is the bond length (in Å). For any binary A m B n -type compounds, the heteropolar C μ part is defined as (8) C μ=14.4 b μ exp ( − k s μ r 0 μ ) [ ( Z A μ ) ∗ − ( n m ) ( Z B μ ) ∗ ] / r 0 μ ( n ≥ m ) ( eV ) (8′) C μ=14.4 b μ exp ( − k s μ r 0 μ ) [ ( m n ) ( Z A μ ) ∗ − ( Z B μ ) ∗ ] / r 0 μ ( n ≤ m ) ( eV ) with (9) r 0 μ=d μ / 2 , (10) k s μ=( 4 k F μ / π a B ) 1 / 2 , (11) ( k F μ ) 3=3 π 2 ( N e μ ) ∗ , (12) ( N e μ ) ∗=( n e μ ) ∗ / V b μ , (13) ( n e μ ) ∗=( Z A μ ) ∗ / N CA μ + ( Z B μ ) ∗ / N CB μ , (14) V b μ=( d μ ) 3 / ∑ v ( d ν ) 3 / N b v , where V b μ is the bond volume, ( n e μ ) ∗ is the number of the effective valence electrons per bond of the type μ, ( N e μ ) ∗ is the number of the effective valence electrons of the type μ per cubic centimeter, ( Z A μ ) ∗ and ( Z B μ ) ∗ are the numbers of effective valence electrons on the A and B atoms of the type μ. k F μ is the Fermi wavenumber of the valence electron in the binary crystal composed of only one type of bond μ, k s μ is the Thomas–Fermi screening wavenumber of the valence electron in the binary crystal composed of only one type of the bond μ, a B is the Bohr radius. b μ is proportional to the square of the average coordination number N c μ , (15) b μ=β ( N c μ ) 2 , (16) N c μ=m N CA μ / ( m + n ) + n N CB μ / ( m + n ) , where b μ depends on a given crystal structure. The typical value of β is 0.089 within 10%.
For the chemical bond of the type μ, the polarizable coefficient α 0 μ can be obtained from the Lorentz–Lorenz equation: (17) ( ɛ μ − 1 ) / ( ɛ μ − 2 )=( 4 π / 3 ) α 0 μ , where ɛ μ is the dielectric constant of a μ type chemical bond. It can be obtained as follows: (18) ɛ μ=1 + 4 π χ μ . Here, χ μ is the total macroscopic susceptibility which a crystal composed entirely of bonds of type μ would have. It can be written as (19) χ μ=( 4 π ) − 1 [ ( h Ω p μ ) 2 / ( E g μ ) 2 ] , where Ω p μ is the plasma frequency obtained from the number of effective valence electrons of type μ per cubic centimeter ( N e μ ) ∗ using the following equation: (20) ( ℏ Ω p μ ) 2=[ ( 4 π ( N e μ ) ∗ e 2 / m ) / D μ A μ ]
Here, D μ and A μ are correction factors from Ref. [33].
Hence, the polarizability of the chemical bond volume (Å3) is given by (21) α b μ=α 0 μ V b μ

Results:
In order to predict the CT energy of YBO3:Eu, firstly, we decompose YBO3 into a sum of the binary crystals using the bond-valence equation mentioned above. And then the main chemical bond parameters, the environmental factors as well as the theoretical charge transfer energies are calculated.
3.1 P 6 ¯ c 2 space group The approximate model for the vaterite-type ABO3 rare earth borates at low temperature is proposed with the space group P 6 ¯ c 2 by Bradley et al. [3]. He took YbBO3 as a typical compound for the group LnBO3 (Ln=Sm→Lu and Y). According to Bradley's structure, the vaterite-type LnBO3 possesses a true hexagonal cell with Z=6, while the two-formula hexagonal cell is only a subcell of the six-formula hexagonal structure. The relationship between the six-formula hexagonal cell proposed by Bradley and the two-formula hexagonal cell can be expressed as a six=3 a two and c six=c two [3]. Therefore, the unit cell parameters of YBO3 are a=6.540Å and c=8.806Å. The crystallographic data and the selected bond distances of the low temperature phase of YBO3 are calculated and shown in Table 2. In the structural model the cations Y3+ have three different positions, which are labeled Y1, Y2, and Y3, respectively. Y1 atom is coordinated by twelve oxygen atoms including six O(1) atoms and six O(2) atoms. Both of the atoms Y2 and Y3 are coordinated by six oxygen atoms. According to the different bonding statuses as shown in Table 3, YBO3 can be decomposed into the sum of pseudo binary crystals as follows: YBO 3=Y ( 1 ) 1 / 3 Y ( 2 ) 1 / 3 Y ( 3 ) 1 / 3 BO ( 1 ) 2 O ( 2 )=1 6 Y ( 1 ) O ( 1 ) 3 + 1 6 Y ( 1 ) O ( 2 ) 3 + 1 6 Y ( 2 ) 2 O ( 1 ) 3 + 1 6 Y ( 3 ) 2 O ( 1 ) 3 + 1 2 BO ( 1 ) + 1 2 BO ( 2 ) In the Eu-doped YBO3 system, all of the three sites Y1, Y2 and Y3 can be substituted by the cation Eu3+. The chemical bond parameters of the three different positions are listed in Table 3.
3.2 C2/c space group To clarify the structures of the vaterite-type rare earth orthoborate, Lin et al. use the neutron powder diffraction technology [12]. The crystal structure of the vaterite-type rare earth orthoborate (Y0.92Er0.08)BO3 was refined. The low temperature polymorph crystallized in a c-centered monoclinic cell with C2/c space symmetry. The unit cell parameters are a=11.3138Å, b=6.5403Å, c=9.5499Å, and β=112.902°. In the structure, the yttrium atoms are surrounded by eight oxygen atoms. Their bond lengths and the coordination number (C.N.) are shown in Table 4. The boron atoms are all tetrahedrally coordinated and form the three-membered ring borate B3O9 groups. According to these structural data, the orthoborate YBO3 in the low temperature can be decomposed into the sum of pseudo binary crystals as follows: YBO 3=Y ( 1 ) 1 / 3 Y ( 2 ) 2 / 3 B ( 1 ) 2 / 3 B ( 2 ) 1 / 3 O ( 1 ) 2 / 3 O ( 2 ) 2 / 3 O ( 3 ) 2 / 3 O ( 4 ) 2 / 3 O ( 5 ) 1 / 3=1 12 Y ( 1 ) O ( 1 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 1 ) O ( 2 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 1 ) O ( 3 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 1 ) O ( 4 ) 2 + 1 6 Y ( 2 ) O ( 1 ) 2 + 1 6 Y ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) 2 + 1 6 Y ( 2 ) O ( 3 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 2 ) O ( 4 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 2 ) O ( 5 ) 2 + 1 6 B ( 1 ) O ( 1 ) + 1 6 B ( 1 ) O ( 2 ) + 1 6 B ( 1 ) O ( 4 ) + 1 6 B ( 1 ) O ( 5 ) + 1 12 B ( 2 ) O ( 3 ) 2 + 1 12 B ( 2 ) O ( 4 ) 2 The calculated chemical bond parameters relating to the environmental factors are listed in Table 5.

P 6 ¯ C 2 Space Group:
The approximate model for the vaterite-type ABO3 rare earth borates at low temperature is proposed with the space group P 6 ¯ c 2 by Bradley et al. [3]. He took YbBO3 as a typical compound for the group LnBO3 (Ln=Sm→Lu and Y).
According to Bradley's structure, the vaterite-type LnBO3 possesses a true hexagonal cell with Z=6, while the two-formula hexagonal cell is only a subcell of the six-formula hexagonal structure. The relationship between the six-formula hexagonal cell proposed by Bradley and the two-formula hexagonal cell can be expressed as a six=3 a two and c six=c two [3]. Therefore, the unit cell parameters of YBO3 are a=6.540Å and c=8.806Å. The crystallographic data and the selected bond distances of the low temperature phase of YBO3 are calculated and shown in Table 2.
In the structural model the cations Y3+ have three different positions, which are labeled Y1, Y2, and Y3, respectively. Y1 atom is coordinated by twelve oxygen atoms including six O(1) atoms and six O(2) atoms. Both of the atoms Y2 and Y3 are coordinated by six oxygen atoms. According to the different bonding statuses as shown in Table 3, YBO3 can be decomposed into the sum of pseudo binary crystals as follows: YBO 3=Y ( 1 ) 1 / 3 Y ( 2 ) 1 / 3 Y ( 3 ) 1 / 3 BO ( 1 ) 2 O ( 2 )=1 6 Y ( 1 ) O ( 1 ) 3 + 1 6 Y ( 1 ) O ( 2 ) 3 + 1 6 Y ( 2 ) 2 O ( 1 ) 3 + 1 6 Y ( 3 ) 2 O ( 1 ) 3 + 1 2 BO ( 1 ) + 1 2 BO ( 2 )
In the Eu-doped YBO3 system, all of the three sites Y1, Y2 and Y3 can be substituted by the cation Eu3+. The chemical bond parameters of the three different positions are listed in Table 3.

C2/c Space Group:
To clarify the structures of the vaterite-type rare earth orthoborate, Lin et al. use the neutron powder diffraction technology [12]. The crystal structure of the vaterite-type rare earth orthoborate (Y0.92Er0.08)BO3 was refined. The low temperature polymorph crystallized in a c-centered monoclinic cell with C2/c space symmetry. The unit cell parameters are a=11.3138Å, b=6.5403Å, c=9.5499Å, and β=112.902°. In the structure, the yttrium atoms are surrounded by eight oxygen atoms. Their bond lengths and the coordination number (C.N.) are shown in Table 4. The boron atoms are all tetrahedrally coordinated and form the three-membered ring borate B3O9 groups. According to these structural data, the orthoborate YBO3 in the low temperature can be decomposed into the sum of pseudo binary crystals as follows: YBO 3=Y ( 1 ) 1 / 3 Y ( 2 ) 2 / 3 B ( 1 ) 2 / 3 B ( 2 ) 1 / 3 O ( 1 ) 2 / 3 O ( 2 ) 2 / 3 O ( 3 ) 2 / 3 O ( 4 ) 2 / 3 O ( 5 ) 1 / 3=1 12 Y ( 1 ) O ( 1 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 1 ) O ( 2 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 1 ) O ( 3 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 1 ) O ( 4 ) 2 + 1 6 Y ( 2 ) O ( 1 ) 2 + 1 6 Y ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) 2 + 1 6 Y ( 2 ) O ( 3 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 2 ) O ( 4 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 2 ) O ( 5 ) 2 + 1 6 B ( 1 ) O ( 1 ) + 1 6 B ( 1 ) O ( 2 ) + 1 6 B ( 1 ) O ( 4 ) + 1 6 B ( 1 ) O ( 5 ) + 1 12 B ( 2 ) O ( 3 ) 2 + 1 12 B ( 2 ) O ( 4 ) 2
The calculated chemical bond parameters relating to the environmental factors are listed in Table 5.

Discussions:
In this study the oxygen-to-europium CT energy is used as a structural probe in the orthoborate YBO3. The CT energy of YBO3:Eu depends on the covalency, the polarizability, the effective charge of the ligands and the coordination number between the ligands and the central ion. All of the influencing factors are included in the environmental factor (h e) and can be quantitatively described using Eq. (2). The predicted CT energies are listed in Table 5.
If the space group of the crystal YBO3 is P 6 ¯ c 2 , the cations Y3+ occupy three different types of sites, Y1, Y2 and Y3 in the ratio 1:1:1. In the three sites Y3+, Y2 and Y3 are both octahedrally coordinated and the Y1 cation is 12-coordinated to oxygen. Therefore, once the cation Eu3+ is doped into crystal YBO3, the positions Y1, Y2 and Y3 are all probable to be substituted by the cation Eu3+. The predicted CT energies of Eu3+ in the three different sites are 6.92eV, 3.54eV and 3.55eV, respectively. From the statistical data of Eu3+-doped complexes, it can be known that the mean error of the predicted CT energy is within 4% using our theoretical method [23]. That is to say, if the space group of the crystal YBO3 is P 6 ¯ c 2 , the CT positions of the three sites are about 179±7nm, 350±14nm, and 349±13.8nm. They are not in agreement with the experimental values [11,17,31]. Thus, the true space group of YBO3 is not P 6 ¯ c 2 .
When YBO3 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with the space group C2/c, the Eu ions occupy two different sites (Y1 and Y2) in the ratio 1:2. They are both coordinated by eight oxygens. Theoretically, the intensity of the CT band in (4c) is relatively weaker because of its smaller number compared with the ions Eu3+ in (8f). The predicted CT energies in (8f) and (4c) are 5.08eV and 5.02eV, respectively. The energy difference between the two different sites is 0.06eV. If the calculation error is considered, the predicted values are about 5.08±0.2eV and 5.02±0.2eV. They are in good agreement with the experimental values (E CT=5.21eV and 5.28eV, ΔE CT=0.07eV) [11]. The main factor leading to the error (0.2eV) may include uncertainties in experimental measurements. It is found that the values reported by different authors may have a difference up to 0.2eV [11,17,27,35]. And another error is in prediction of the environmental factor. The predicted values with C2/c are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results. Thus, the space group with C2/c is true from the chemical bond viewpoint.

Conclusion:
The environmental factors are computed and the corresponding CT energies of Eu3+ are predicted from all probable space groups of the orthoborate YBO3 based on the dielectric theory of the complex crystal. The result shows that only the space group C2/c proposed by Lin et al. is in good agreement with the experimental phenomena. The method provides us with a supplementary tool to judge the proper structure when the structure of the crystal has many uncertain space groups.

The chemical bond parameters between the cation and the ligands have been quantitatively determined based on the dielectric theory of complex crystal. This theory is the extension of the theory developed by Phillips, Van Vechten and Levine (PVL) [32,33]. The dielectric theory for the complex crystal has been successfully applied in a variety of research fields, such as nonlinear optical crystal [34–36], high Tc oxides [37], hardness of the covalent crystal [38,39] and so forth. According to all of the possible space groups of the vaterite-type orthoborate, the values of the CT energies in Eu-doped YBO3 were predicted. The method provides us with a supplementary tool to judge the proper structure when the structure of the crystal has many uncertain space groups.

The quantitative relationship between the CT energy (in eV) and the environmental factor (h e) can be expressed as follows [23]: (1) E CT=A + B × exp ( − k × h e ) , where A=2.804, B=6.924, and k=1.256 for Eu3+ ion. The environmental factor (h e) [23,40,41] in Eq. (1) can be expressed as (2) h e=( ∑ μ f c μ α b μ Q B μ 2 ) 1 / 2 , where f c μ is the covalency for any individual bond μ surrounding the center ion in a multibond crystal, α b μ is the polarizability of the ligand bond volume in the type-μ bond (in Å3), and Q B μ stands for the presented charge of the ligands in the chemical bond of the type μ.

In order to calculate the chemical bond parameters above, the complex crystal firstly should be decomposed into a sum of the binary crystals using the bond-valence equation [36,39,42,43]. In the equation any binary crystal includes only one type of the chemical bond, but the properties of these binary crystals are different from those of a real corresponding binary crystal, although its chemical bond parameters can be calculated in a similar way. When detailed information of the crystal structure is given, the sub-formula equation (the bond-valence equation) of the crystal can be obtained according to the crystal formula. Suppose A denotes cations and B anions, any multibond complex crystal can be written as A a 1 1 A a 2 2 ⋯ A a i i B b 1 1 B b 2 2 ⋯ B b j j , where A a i i , B b j j stand for the different constituent elements or different sites of the same element in the crystal formula, and a i , b j represent the number of the corresponding element. The sub-formula of any type of chemical bond A–B can be expressed by the following formula: (3) N ( B j − A i ) × a i N CA i A i N ( A i − B j ) × b j N CB j B j=A m i i B n j j , where m i=N ( B j − A i ) × a i N CA i , n j=N ( A i − B j ) × b j N CB j .

And the bond sub-formula equation is given by (4) A a 1 1 A a 2 2 ⋯ A a i i B b 1 1 B b 2 2 ⋯ B b j j=∑ i , j A m i i B n j j , where N ( B j − A i ) is the number of B j ions in the coordination group of an A i ion, and N CA i represents the nearest coordination number of A i ion. Then, the complex crystal is decomposed into the sum of the different binary crystals like A m i i B n j j . Therefore, the presented charge Q B μ of each anion can be obtained according to the neutral principle of the binary crystals as the equation Q B=m Q A / n .

According to the PVL [32,33] theory the fractional covalency f c μ for any individual bond μ in the multibond crystal can be defined as follows: (5) f c μ=( E h μ ) 2 / ( E g μ ) 2 , where E g μ is the average energy band gap between the bonding and antibonding status (in eV). ( E g μ ) 2 can be separated into homopolar ( E h μ ) 2 and heteropolar ( C μ ) 2 parts in analogy with the work of PVL theory. Thus, (6) ( E g μ ) 2=( E h μ ) 2 + ( C μ ) 2 , where (7) E h μ=39.74 / ( d μ ) 2.48 ( eV ) and d μ is the bond length (in Å). For any binary A m B n -type compounds, the heteropolar C μ part is defined as (8) C μ=14.4 b μ exp ( − k s μ r 0 μ ) [ ( Z A μ ) ∗ − ( n m ) ( Z B μ ) ∗ ] / r 0 μ ( n ≥ m ) ( eV ) (8′) C μ=14.4 b μ exp ( − k s μ r 0 μ ) [ ( m n ) ( Z A μ ) ∗ − ( Z B μ ) ∗ ] / r 0 μ ( n ≤ m ) ( eV ) with (9) r 0 μ=d μ / 2 , (10) k s μ=( 4 k F μ / π a B ) 1 / 2 , (11) ( k F μ ) 3=3 π 2 ( N e μ ) ∗ , (12) ( N e μ ) ∗=( n e μ ) ∗ / V b μ , (13) ( n e μ ) ∗=( Z A μ ) ∗ / N CA μ + ( Z B μ ) ∗ / N CB μ , (14) V b μ=( d μ ) 3 / ∑ v ( d ν ) 3 / N b v , where V b μ is the bond volume, ( n e μ ) ∗ is the number of the effective valence electrons per bond of the type μ, ( N e μ ) ∗ is the number of the effective valence electrons of the type μ per cubic centimeter, ( Z A μ ) ∗ and ( Z B μ ) ∗ are the numbers of effective valence electrons on the A and B atoms of the type μ. k F μ is the Fermi wavenumber of the valence electron in the binary crystal composed of only one type of bond μ, k s μ is the Thomas–Fermi screening wavenumber of the valence electron in the binary crystal composed of only one type of the bond μ, a B is the Bohr radius. b μ is proportional to the square of the average coordination number N c μ , (15) b μ=β ( N c μ ) 2 , (16) N c μ=m N CA μ / ( m + n ) + n N CB μ / ( m + n ) , where b μ depends on a given crystal structure. The typical value of β is 0.089 within 10%.

For the chemical bond of the type μ, the polarizable coefficient α 0 μ can be obtained from the Lorentz–Lorenz equation: (17) ( ɛ μ − 1 ) / ( ɛ μ − 2 )=( 4 π / 3 ) α 0 μ , where ɛ μ is the dielectric constant of a μ type chemical bond. It can be obtained as follows: (18) ɛ μ=1 + 4 π χ μ . Here, χ μ is the total macroscopic susceptibility which a crystal composed entirely of bonds of type μ would have. It can be written as (19) χ μ=( 4 π ) − 1 [ ( h Ω p μ ) 2 / ( E g μ ) 2 ] , where Ω p μ is the plasma frequency obtained from the number of effective valence electrons of type μ per cubic centimeter ( N e μ ) ∗ using the following equation: (20) ( ℏ Ω p μ ) 2=[ ( 4 π ( N e μ ) ∗ e 2 / m ) / D μ A μ ]

Here, D μ and A μ are correction factors from Ref. [33].

Hence, the polarizability of the chemical bond volume (Å3) is given by (21) α b μ=α 0 μ V b μ

In order to predict the CT energy of YBO3:Eu, firstly, we decompose YBO3 into a sum of the binary crystals using the bond-valence equation mentioned above. And then the main chemical bond parameters, the environmental factors as well as the theoretical charge transfer energies are calculated.

The approximate model for the vaterite-type ABO3 rare earth borates at low temperature is proposed with the space group P 6 ¯ c 2 by Bradley et al. [3]. He took YbBO3 as a typical compound for the group LnBO3 (Ln=Sm→Lu and Y).

According to Bradley's structure, the vaterite-type LnBO3 possesses a true hexagonal cell with Z=6, while the two-formula hexagonal cell is only a subcell of the six-formula hexagonal structure. The relationship between the six-formula hexagonal cell proposed by Bradley and the two-formula hexagonal cell can be expressed as a six=3 a two and c six=c two [3]. Therefore, the unit cell parameters of YBO3 are a=6.540Å and c=8.806Å. The crystallographic data and the selected bond distances of the low temperature phase of YBO3 are calculated and shown in Table 2.

In the structural model the cations Y3+ have three different positions, which are labeled Y1, Y2, and Y3, respectively. Y1 atom is coordinated by twelve oxygen atoms including six O(1) atoms and six O(2) atoms. Both of the atoms Y2 and Y3 are coordinated by six oxygen atoms. According to the different bonding statuses as shown in Table 3, YBO3 can be decomposed into the sum of pseudo binary crystals as follows: YBO 3=Y ( 1 ) 1 / 3 Y ( 2 ) 1 / 3 Y ( 3 ) 1 / 3 BO ( 1 ) 2 O ( 2 )=1 6 Y ( 1 ) O ( 1 ) 3 + 1 6 Y ( 1 ) O ( 2 ) 3 + 1 6 Y ( 2 ) 2 O ( 1 ) 3 + 1 6 Y ( 3 ) 2 O ( 1 ) 3 + 1 2 BO ( 1 ) + 1 2 BO ( 2 )

In the Eu-doped YBO3 system, all of the three sites Y1, Y2 and Y3 can be substituted by the cation Eu3+. The chemical bond parameters of the three different positions are listed in Table 3.

To clarify the structures of the vaterite-type rare earth orthoborate, Lin et al. use the neutron powder diffraction technology [12]. The crystal structure of the vaterite-type rare earth orthoborate (Y0.92Er0.08)BO3 was refined. The low temperature polymorph crystallized in a c-centered monoclinic cell with C2/c space symmetry. The unit cell parameters are a=11.3138Å, b=6.5403Å, c=9.5499Å, and β=112.902°. In the structure, the yttrium atoms are surrounded by eight oxygen atoms. Their bond lengths and the coordination number (C.N.) are shown in Table 4. The boron atoms are all tetrahedrally coordinated and form the three-membered ring borate B3O9 groups. According to these structural data, the orthoborate YBO3 in the low temperature can be decomposed into the sum of pseudo binary crystals as follows: YBO 3=Y ( 1 ) 1 / 3 Y ( 2 ) 2 / 3 B ( 1 ) 2 / 3 B ( 2 ) 1 / 3 O ( 1 ) 2 / 3 O ( 2 ) 2 / 3 O ( 3 ) 2 / 3 O ( 4 ) 2 / 3 O ( 5 ) 1 / 3=1 12 Y ( 1 ) O ( 1 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 1 ) O ( 2 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 1 ) O ( 3 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 1 ) O ( 4 ) 2 + 1 6 Y ( 2 ) O ( 1 ) 2 + 1 6 Y ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) 2 + 1 6 Y ( 2 ) O ( 3 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 2 ) O ( 4 ) 2 + 1 12 Y ( 2 ) O ( 5 ) 2 + 1 6 B ( 1 ) O ( 1 ) + 1 6 B ( 1 ) O ( 2 ) + 1 6 B ( 1 ) O ( 4 ) + 1 6 B ( 1 ) O ( 5 ) + 1 12 B ( 2 ) O ( 3 ) 2 + 1 12 B ( 2 ) O ( 4 ) 2

The calculated chemical bond parameters relating to the environmental factors are listed in Table 5.

In this study the oxygen-to-europium CT energy is used as a structural probe in the orthoborate YBO3. The CT energy of YBO3:Eu depends on the covalency, the polarizability, the effective charge of the ligands and the coordination number between the ligands and the central ion. All of the influencing factors are included in the environmental factor (h e) and can be quantitatively described using Eq. (2). The predicted CT energies are listed in Table 5.

If the space group of the crystal YBO3 is P 6 ¯ c 2 , the cations Y3+ occupy three different types of sites, Y1, Y2 and Y3 in the ratio 1:1:1. In the three sites Y3+, Y2 and Y3 are both octahedrally coordinated and the Y1 cation is 12-coordinated to oxygen. Therefore, once the cation Eu3+ is doped into crystal YBO3, the positions Y1, Y2 and Y3 are all probable to be substituted by the cation Eu3+. The predicted CT energies of Eu3+ in the three different sites are 6.92eV, 3.54eV and 3.55eV, respectively. From the statistical data of Eu3+-doped complexes, it can be known that the mean error of the predicted CT energy is within 4% using our theoretical method [23]. That is to say, if the space group of the crystal YBO3 is P 6 ¯ c 2 , the CT positions of the three sites are about 179±7nm, 350±14nm, and 349±13.8nm. They are not in agreement with the experimental values [11,17,31]. Thus, the true space group of YBO3 is not P 6 ¯ c 2 .

When YBO3 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with the space group C2/c, the Eu ions occupy two different sites (Y1 and Y2) in the ratio 1:2. They are both coordinated by eight oxygens. Theoretically, the intensity of the CT band in (4c) is relatively weaker because of its smaller number compared with the ions Eu3+ in (8f). The predicted CT energies in (8f) and (4c) are 5.08eV and 5.02eV, respectively. The energy difference between the two different sites is 0.06eV. If the calculation error is considered, the predicted values are about 5.08±0.2eV and 5.02±0.2eV. They are in good agreement with the experimental values (E CT=5.21eV and 5.28eV, ΔE CT=0.07eV) [11]. The main factor leading to the error (0.2eV) may include uncertainties in experimental measurements. It is found that the values reported by different authors may have a difference up to 0.2eV [11,17,27,35]. And another error is in prediction of the environmental factor. The predicted values with C2/c are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results. Thus, the space group with C2/c is true from the chemical bond viewpoint.

The environmental factors are computed and the corresponding CT energies of Eu3+ are predicted from all probable space groups of the orthoborate YBO3 based on the dielectric theory of the complex crystal. The result shows that only the space group C2/c proposed by Lin et al. is in good agreement with the experimental phenomena. The method provides us with a supplementary tool to judge the proper structure when the structure of the crystal has many uncertain space groups.

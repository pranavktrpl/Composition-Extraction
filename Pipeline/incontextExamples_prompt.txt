Title:
Cutting performance and wear mechanism of TiB

Abstract:
TiB2–20vol%B4C (TB20) and TiB2–80vol%B4C (TB80) ceramic cutting tool materials were prepared by hot pressing, and then tested in turning of Ti6Al4V alloy with various cutting parameters. The tool life and wear mechanism of TB20 and TB80 were studied and compared with a commercial grade tungsten carbide tool (WO). The results of turning showed that effective cutting length of TB20 was about one third longer than that of TB80 and WO. Among the three tools, the increment of cutting temperature measured for TB20 was the lowest as flank wear increased from 0 to 600 µm. Analysis showed that dominant wear mechanism was adhesive wear in all of the three tools tested, while chipping was also observed in TB80 and temperature deterioration in WO. In addition, the TB20 exhibited a much better integrity of cutting edge after flank wear reaching 600 µm, due to its higher toughness than TB80 and higher thermal resistance than WO, respectively. The adhesive layers of work-piece material on the rake and flank faces of both TB20 and TB80 were much thinner than that of WO, which suggested a lower adhesive wear rate in TiB2-B4C cutting tools. The high wear resistance of TiB2-B4C cutting tools is attributed to higher thermal resistance, higher hardness, and lower chemical affinity with titanium as compared with tungsten carbides, which makes them very promising materials for high speed machining of titanium alloys.

Introduction:
High speed precision machining has been developed with several advantages such as high removal rates, low cutting forces, excellent dimensional accuracy [1], and surface finishing quality as well as surface integrity [2]. Titanium alloy is one of the most difficult-to-cut materials that only allows very low cutting speed to achieve adequate dimensional tolerance and surface finish in traditional cutting process. In cutting of Ti6Al4V alloys, the cutting force decreased with the increase in cutting speed because of the occurrence of conflicting work hardening–thermal softening processes with the deformation phase of the chip segment [3]. The cutting temperature would increase slightly as the cutting speed increased [4], but would increase dramatically with increasing flank wear of the cutting tools [5]. Tungsten carbide is one of the most commonly used tools for machining titanium alloys, but with increasing cutting speed, its tool life would drop rapidly due to severely unpredicted tool wear [6]. Wear mechanism of uncoated cemented carbides included adhesive wear, crater wear [7], and diffusion that would gradually become dominant as cutting speed and attrition increased [8]. Tool life of uncoated carbides would decrease to less than 2 min when cutting speed reaches 150 m/min in cutting of Ti6Al4V [9]. In order to increase cutting speed and efficiency, and improve surface finish quality, tungsten carbides with various coatings have been developed. One of them was boride coatings with high hardness and excellent thermal conductivity. In turning of Ti6Al4V, Cherukuri and Molian [10] demonstrated that AlMgB14–20%TiB2 coated carbide inserts exhibited two times longer lifetime in flank and nose wears than uncoated carbide inserts at cutting speed of 61 m/min. Corduan [11] also showed that TiB2 monolayer could be used in cutting of Ti6Al4V without problems of adhesion in relative low cutting speed. On the other hand, researchers have manufactured TiB2-based ceramic cutting tools for interest of its high hardness, high strength, high melting point, high fracture toughness, and high wear resistance [12,13]. Therefore, TiB2 based bulk cutting tools are considered to be excellent cutting tool candidate to machine high strength metals such as titanium and nickel-based alloy. However, the cutting performance of TiB2-based ceramic cutting tools has been rarely studied and reported, especially in titanium alloys, in open literatures.
The cutting performance of TiB2-B4C ceramic cutting tools in high speed turning of Ti6Al4V alloy was evaluated in the present study. The objective of this study was to provide insight into the relationship between tool life and wear mechanisms, which could in turn offer fundamental guide lines to optimize the TiB2-based ceramic cutting tools for high speed machining of difficult-to-cut materials.

Experimental Procedures:
TiB2-B4C composite materials were prepared from TiB2 (99.5% in purity, mean size 5 µm) and B4C (99% in purity, mean size 3 µm) powders. The composites of TB20 and TB80 with 20 and 80 vol% B4C powders, respectively, as shown in Table 1,were mixed for 24 h in a polyethylene jar using ethyl alcohol and Si3N4 balls, and dried in rotary evaporator. The dried powder mixtures were hot-pressed in graphite element resistance furnace at 2000 °C for 60 min under 30 MPa in 1 atm Ar atmosphere.
The bulk density of the sintered composites was measured using Archimedes principle in distilled water. Microstructure of the metallographic samples were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova NanoSEM430, FEI, The Netherlands), equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer analysis system (EDS) for compositional analysis. Vickers hardness was measured by the indentation method using a load of 24.5 N for 10 s on a polished surface. Fracture toughness was determined using both indentation method and single-edge notched beam (SENB) test. Fracture toughness measured by indentation method was using a Vickers indenter with an indentation load of 98 N according to the equation proposed by Anstis [14]. Fracture toughness measured by SENB test was using rectangular (25 mm × 5 mm × 2.5 mm) bars with 2.5 mm notched depth and 0.2 mm notched width, with span width of 20 mm and a crosshead displacement of 0.05 mm/min. The flexural strength was measured in a four-point bending test fixture with an inter span width of 10 mm and an outer span width of 20 mm, and a crosshead displacement of 0.5 mm/min on rectangular (25 mm × 2 mm × 1.5 mm) bars at room temperature.
The prepared TiB2-B4C materials were processed into standard cutting tools of ISO SNGN120408 (12.7 mm × 12.7 mm, 4.76 mm thickness, 0.8 mm nose radius) [15]. In addition, all inserts have a chamfered edge of 0.2 mm long with a 20° normal rake. A commercially available cobalt cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co) cutting tool, named as WO, (Zhuzhou Cemented Carbide Cutting Tools co., LTD, China) with the same geometry was also acquired for experimental comparison with TiB2-B4C cutting tools.
Only hardness and indentation toughness of WO were measured because of the limited geometry size of the tool pieces. Cutting tests were carried out on a NC (Numerical Control) lathe system (ETC3650h, China) equipped with a commercial tool holder having the geometry: rake angle γ o=−6°, clearance angle α o=6°, inclination angle λ s=−6°, side cutting edge angle K r=45°. A 100-mm-diameter cylinder Ti6Al4V alloy in the as-forged condition were used for the cutting tool evaluation (Baoti group co., LTD). Hardness of the Ti6Al4V alloy was determined as 3.83±0.03 GPa (about 40.5HRC) by indentation method with indentation load of 9.8 N for 10 s.
The tool rejection and failure criteria for the experiments were the localized flank wear (VB) > 0.6 mm and excessive chipping, flaking and/or fracturing of the cutting edge. Cutting conditions employed in this study are: cutting speeds V c in the range of 150–300 m/min, feed rates f of 0.1 mm/r, depths of cut a p of 0.5 mm. Flank wear was observed and measured using an optical microscope system linked via transducers to a digital read out. When flank wear reached 600 µm, the accumulated cutting length (L) was regarded as tool life. Cutting temperature was determined using an infrared thermal image system (TVS-500EX, NEC, Japan). Analysis of worn rake and flank regions on the tools and chemical analysis of the worn regions was performed using the scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova NanoSEM430, FEI, The Netherlands).

Results And Discussion:
3.1 Microstructure and mechanical properties Microstructural analysis showed that the TB20 and TB80 composites had a homogeneous microstructure, as shown in Fig. 1. The black and grey phases were identified as B4C and TiB2, respectively. More pores were observed in TB20, compared with TB80 and this was consistent with the measurements of relative densities of TB20 and TB80, which were 95.5% and 98.1%, respectively. Microstructure of commercial WO cutting tool was also shown in Fig. 1. According to the EDS analysis in the rectangle area of Fig. 1c, Co content of the WO cutting tool was ~ 4 wt%. Results of flexural strength, fracture toughness, and Vickers hardness of TB20 and TB80 were presented in Table 1. Flexure strength of TB20 was slightly lower than that of TB80 due to the relative low density, but fracture toughness was higher in TB20. Hardness of TB80 was 34% higher than that of TB20, due to the intrinsic high hardness of B4C phase. Vickers hardness of WO was about 15% lower than TB20, but fracture toughness of WO was about 135% higher, also seen in Table 1. It was found that mechanical properties of TB20, TB80, and WO were comparable with reported values on mechanical properties of TiB2-B4C and WC-Co materials in literatures [16–18], as shown in Table 1.
3.2 Cutting performance Cutting performance of TB20, TB80 and WO were studied. In general, the cutting processes were stable without catastrophic failure of the cutting edge during the machining for all of the materials evaluated. Fig. 2 showed four plots of flank wear (VB) of the three cutting tools versus cutting length (L): TB20, TB80, and WO, at four different cutting speeds: 150, 200, 250, and 300 m/min. It can be seen that the wear rates of flank wear of TB20 and TB80 were high at the beginning of machining, and then become steady state with the increase in cutting length. On the other hand, the wear rate of WO was relative slow as compared to both TB20 and TB80 in the beginning of the cutting process, but increased dramatically as the cutting length increased at the later stage of machining, possibly suggestive of the end of tool life. The progressive and stable tool-wear rate was observed in both TB20 and TB80 during the cutting process, which was in sharp contrast to that of WO tool. Result of flank wear behavior suggested that the TiB2-B4C ceramic cutting tools exhibited a much longer lifetime performance than the commercially available cemented tungsten carbide cutting tool. Fig. 3 shows the variation in effective cutting length of the tools with varying cutting speeds. Note that the tool life defined in the present study is when the flank wear reaches 600 µm. The effective cutting length of each tool dropped dramatically with increasing cutting speed. Among three cutting tools, the TB20 had the longest tool life at each cutting speed. The cutting temperatures corresponding to different tool flank wear were also measured. Measurements of the cutting temperature increased almost linearly with the increase of flank wear as shown in Fig. 4. At the beginning of turning when cutting tool was almost intact, the cutting temperatures of TB20, TB80, and WO were about 590 °C, 630 °C and 450 °C, respectively. When VB was about reaching 600 µm, the cutting temperature increased to about 850 °C, 840 °C and 800 °C for TB20, TB80, and WO, respectively. The temperature increment of WO was about 120 °C higher than that of TiB2-B4C cutting tools with the increase of VB from 0 to 600 µm. Temperature corresponding to each flank wear content was obtained in the very beginning of each feed after measurement of the flank wear, so temperature increment implied the damage degree of cutting edge condition. Presumably, cutting edge of WO would deteriorate severely as cutting continued, while TB20 and TB80 comparatively held a smooth wear rate.
3.3 Wear morphology and wear mechanism Observations of SEM images of the wear morphology projecting toward flank face, in dry turning of Ti6Al4V at cutting speed of 250 m/min, were shown in Fig. 5. The integrity of cutting edge of TB20 (Fig. 5a) was the best as compared with that observed in TB80 (Fig. 5c) and WO (Fig. 5e), which suggested that TB20 might be still in stable wear stage. The main tool wear modes were also identified in Fig. 5. As for TiB2-B4C cutting tools, several chippings with small size were observed in TB20, and work piece material build-up was developed in the chippings (Fig. 5b). However, because of lower fracture toughness, chippings of TB80, especially in the position where in contact with work surface, were too large to be negligible. It was attributed to the work hardening of work surface of Ti6Al4V that chipping happened more severely at the boundary of the cutting edge where in contact with work surface. In the TB80, chipping mode would finally develop into notch wear (Fig. 5c) under high speed intermittent impact of harden burr of work surface. As for TB20, due to the higher toughness, chipping size was relatively small and also very minor change occurred in the cutting edge structure, thus it was less prone to introduce burr and form notch wear. Toughness of WO was relatively much higher, so tipping would hardly happen. Nevertheless, the high-temperature resistance and high-temperature strength of cemented carbide was usually lower than TiB2-B4C ceramics, which led to high temperature deterioration of WO. As for TiB2-based, B4C-based or TiB2-B4C ceramics, considerable studies have shown that bending strength can maintain room temperature strength up to 1500 °C without reduction, or even slightly increase as temperature increasing [17,19–21]. For WC-Co composites, however, remarkable reduction in the bending strength at around 600 °C was observed, which was mainly due to the softening of the Co matrix, and further reduction at around 900 °C was predominately derived from WC softening [22–25]. As a result, the crater wear of WO was deeper when VB reached 600 µm (Fig. 5e). In addition, thermal attack in the crater from hot cutting chips gave rise to cracks and then adhesive and peel-off wear in WO (Fig. 5f). Adhesive wear was prevalent in the rake face and flank face of WO, while adherent workpiece was most likely to gather on the small chippings and the boundary between crater and rake face of TB20 and TB80. The build-up workpiece on chippings might easily break way, but the strongly adherent pitch-like workpiece maintained an intimate and sustained contact with the rake face (Fig. 5b, d). In addition, adhesive layer could be identified as a very thin film on the flank face of TB20 and TB80. Therefore, it could be proposed that the main wear mechanism was adhesive wear for TB20, adhesive wear and chipping for TB80, and adhesive wear and temperature deterioration for WO. Since adhesive wear was the dominant mechanism in these three tools, the detailed analysis of adhesive layer on the rake and flank face was conducted using SEM. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 showed the microstructure and element distribution of cross-section perpendicular to the cutting edge of TB20 and WO after machining at cutting speed of 250 m/min, respectively. Observations of cross-section revealed the depth of wear and the extent of the damage to the tool surface. From the SEM images, the depth of flank wear of TB20 was about 50 µm (Fig. 6a), and the depth of flank wear of WO was > 100 µm (Fig. 7a). The white arrows in Fig. 6b and Fig. 7b corresponded to the EDS lines scan plot shown in Fig. 6c and Fig. 7c, respectively. There was a marked change in material composition from the surface of the crater of TB20 towards the tool substrate. Based on EDS data, the pitch-like adherent material with the thickness of about 30 µm came from the Ti6Al4V workpiece, Fig. 6b. In addition, the EDS data confirmed that the adhesive layer (dark) with the thickness of about 40 µm resulting from the workpiece was also observed on the crater and the flank face of WO, Fig. 7b. On the other hand, tool material particles carried away by the adhesive layer were found on the flank face of WO, and cracks that would led to a chunk of exfoliation from tool material were observed on the rake face, Fig. 7a. It was generally well accepted that the dominant wear mechanism of tungsten-carbide tools during turning of titanium alloys was adhesion resulting from dissolution and diffusion process [26]. The large forces and high temperature during cutting, combined with the high titanium chemical reactivity, would lead to diffusion and adhesion of the tool elements into the Ti6Al4V chips and at the same time for the workpiece material elements bonded onto the tool surfaces [27]. Observations showed that thinner adherent layer, better integrity of cutting edge, and more legible borderline between layer and tool bulk were evident in the TB20, which suggested that the diffusion of tool elements into the Ti6Al4V alloy was very minor even at the high cutting temperature. Nevertheless, when the intimate layer was detached from the chip or workpiece, the high adhesive forces were likely to result in the plunking out of hard particles from the tool causing its surface to become groove and crater as well as flank wear depth to increase. For ultra-hard cutting tool materials, the resistance to plastic deformation at elevated temperatures would be an important intrinsic material property [28]. In compared with tungsten-carbides, TiB2-B4C ceramics could achieve a longer tool life and better performance in high speed cutting of Ti6Al4V alloys due to better high temperature properties. It was noted that the hardness of TB80 was much higher than that of TB20, but the tool life of TB80 was shorter than that of TB20. The hardness of TB20 was about 20.87 GPa, which was adequate for machining relative soft metals like titanium alloy. However, because of adhesive wear, the combination of crater and flank wear would undermine the integrity of cutting edge and those unsupported pieces would then break away [27]. In the final stage, the fracture toughness of the cutting tool material would play a more important role in determining the lifetime performance. The hardness of TiB2-B4C increased with the decrease of TiB2 content, while the fracture toughness decreased. Chipping of the cutting edge would be the main failure mode of the cutting tools as TiB2 content decreased. In addition, Ti could react with B4C in vacuum at temperature above 1100 °C by the following reaction [29]: (1) 3Ti + B 4 C=TiB 2 + TiC Reaction (1) could be initiated at a relatively lower temperature with the incorporation of air [30]. So, presumably, TiB2-B4C ceramic cutting tools with higher TiB2 content could have better cutting performance and longer tool life in cutting of Ti6Al4V alloys.

Microstructure And Mechanical Properties:
Microstructural analysis showed that the TB20 and TB80 composites had a homogeneous microstructure, as shown in Fig. 1. The black and grey phases were identified as B4C and TiB2, respectively. More pores were observed in TB20, compared with TB80 and this was consistent with the measurements of relative densities of TB20 and TB80, which were 95.5% and 98.1%, respectively. Microstructure of commercial WO cutting tool was also shown in Fig. 1. According to the EDS analysis in the rectangle area of Fig. 1c, Co content of the WO cutting tool was ~ 4 wt%.
Results of flexural strength, fracture toughness, and Vickers hardness of TB20 and TB80 were presented in Table 1. Flexure strength of TB20 was slightly lower than that of TB80 due to the relative low density, but fracture toughness was higher in TB20. Hardness of TB80 was 34% higher than that of TB20, due to the intrinsic high hardness of B4C phase. Vickers hardness of WO was about 15% lower than TB20, but fracture toughness of WO was about 135% higher, also seen in Table 1. It was found that mechanical properties of TB20, TB80, and WO were comparable with reported values on mechanical properties of TiB2-B4C and WC-Co materials in literatures [16–18], as shown in Table 1.

Cutting Performance:
Cutting performance of TB20, TB80 and WO were studied. In general, the cutting processes were stable without catastrophic failure of the cutting edge during the machining for all of the materials evaluated. Fig. 2 showed four plots of flank wear (VB) of the three cutting tools versus cutting length (L): TB20, TB80, and WO, at four different cutting speeds: 150, 200, 250, and 300 m/min. It can be seen that the wear rates of flank wear of TB20 and TB80 were high at the beginning of machining, and then become steady state with the increase in cutting length. On the other hand, the wear rate of WO was relative slow as compared to both TB20 and TB80 in the beginning of the cutting process, but increased dramatically as the cutting length increased at the later stage of machining, possibly suggestive of the end of tool life. The progressive and stable tool-wear rate was observed in both TB20 and TB80 during the cutting process, which was in sharp contrast to that of WO tool. Result of flank wear behavior suggested that the TiB2-B4C ceramic cutting tools exhibited a much longer lifetime performance than the commercially available cemented tungsten carbide cutting tool.
Fig. 3 shows the variation in effective cutting length of the tools with varying cutting speeds. Note that the tool life defined in the present study is when the flank wear reaches 600 µm. The effective cutting length of each tool dropped dramatically with increasing cutting speed. Among three cutting tools, the TB20 had the longest tool life at each cutting speed.
The cutting temperatures corresponding to different tool flank wear were also measured. Measurements of the cutting temperature increased almost linearly with the increase of flank wear as shown in Fig. 4. At the beginning of turning when cutting tool was almost intact, the cutting temperatures of TB20, TB80, and WO were about 590 °C, 630 °C and 450 °C, respectively. When VB was about reaching 600 µm, the cutting temperature increased to about 850 °C, 840 °C and 800 °C for TB20, TB80, and WO, respectively. The temperature increment of WO was about 120 °C higher than that of TiB2-B4C cutting tools with the increase of VB from 0 to 600 µm. Temperature corresponding to each flank wear content was obtained in the very beginning of each feed after measurement of the flank wear, so temperature increment implied the damage degree of cutting edge condition. Presumably, cutting edge of WO would deteriorate severely as cutting continued, while TB20 and TB80 comparatively held a smooth wear rate.

Wear Morphology And Wear Mechanism:
Observations of SEM images of the wear morphology projecting toward flank face, in dry turning of Ti6Al4V at cutting speed of 250 m/min, were shown in Fig. 5. The integrity of cutting edge of TB20 (Fig. 5a) was the best as compared with that observed in TB80 (Fig. 5c) and WO (Fig. 5e), which suggested that TB20 might be still in stable wear stage. The main tool wear modes were also identified in Fig. 5. As for TiB2-B4C cutting tools, several chippings with small size were observed in TB20, and work piece material build-up was developed in the chippings (Fig. 5b). However, because of lower fracture toughness, chippings of TB80, especially in the position where in contact with work surface, were too large to be negligible. It was attributed to the work hardening of work surface of Ti6Al4V that chipping happened more severely at the boundary of the cutting edge where in contact with work surface. In the TB80, chipping mode would finally develop into notch wear (Fig. 5c) under high speed intermittent impact of harden burr of work surface. As for TB20, due to the higher toughness, chipping size was relatively small and also very minor change occurred in the cutting edge structure, thus it was less prone to introduce burr and form notch wear.
Toughness of WO was relatively much higher, so tipping would hardly happen. Nevertheless, the high-temperature resistance and high-temperature strength of cemented carbide was usually lower than TiB2-B4C ceramics, which led to high temperature deterioration of WO. As for TiB2-based, B4C-based or TiB2-B4C ceramics, considerable studies have shown that bending strength can maintain room temperature strength up to 1500 °C without reduction, or even slightly increase as temperature increasing [17,19–21]. For WC-Co composites, however, remarkable reduction in the bending strength at around 600 °C was observed, which was mainly due to the softening of the Co matrix, and further reduction at around 900 °C was predominately derived from WC softening [22–25]. As a result, the crater wear of WO was deeper when VB reached 600 µm (Fig. 5e). In addition, thermal attack in the crater from hot cutting chips gave rise to cracks and then adhesive and peel-off wear in WO (Fig. 5f).
Adhesive wear was prevalent in the rake face and flank face of WO, while adherent workpiece was most likely to gather on the small chippings and the boundary between crater and rake face of TB20 and TB80. The build-up workpiece on chippings might easily break way, but the strongly adherent pitch-like workpiece maintained an intimate and sustained contact with the rake face (Fig. 5b, d). In addition, adhesive layer could be identified as a very thin film on the flank face of TB20 and TB80. Therefore, it could be proposed that the main wear mechanism was adhesive wear for TB20, adhesive wear and chipping for TB80, and adhesive wear and temperature deterioration for WO.
Since adhesive wear was the dominant mechanism in these three tools, the detailed analysis of adhesive layer on the rake and flank face was conducted using SEM. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 showed the microstructure and element distribution of cross-section perpendicular to the cutting edge of TB20 and WO after machining at cutting speed of 250 m/min, respectively. Observations of cross-section revealed the depth of wear and the extent of the damage to the tool surface. From the SEM images, the depth of flank wear of TB20 was about 50 µm (Fig. 6a), and the depth of flank wear of WO was > 100 µm (Fig. 7a).
The white arrows in Fig. 6b and Fig. 7b corresponded to the EDS lines scan plot shown in Fig. 6c and Fig. 7c, respectively. There was a marked change in material composition from the surface of the crater of TB20 towards the tool substrate. Based on EDS data, the pitch-like adherent material with the thickness of about 30 µm came from the Ti6Al4V workpiece, Fig. 6b. In addition, the EDS data confirmed that the adhesive layer (dark) with the thickness of about 40 µm resulting from the workpiece was also observed on the crater and the flank face of WO, Fig. 7b. On the other hand, tool material particles carried away by the adhesive layer were found on the flank face of WO, and cracks that would led to a chunk of exfoliation from tool material were observed on the rake face, Fig. 7a. It was generally well accepted that the dominant wear mechanism of tungsten-carbide tools during turning of titanium alloys was adhesion resulting from dissolution and diffusion process [26]. The large forces and high temperature during cutting, combined with the high titanium chemical reactivity, would lead to diffusion and adhesion of the tool elements into the Ti6Al4V chips and at the same time for the workpiece material elements bonded onto the tool surfaces [27].
Observations showed that thinner adherent layer, better integrity of cutting edge, and more legible borderline between layer and tool bulk were evident in the TB20, which suggested that the diffusion of tool elements into the Ti6Al4V alloy was very minor even at the high cutting temperature.

For ultra-hard cutting tool materials, the resistance to plastic deformation at elevated temperatures would be an important intrinsic material property [28]. In compared with tungsten-carbides, TiB2-B4C ceramics could achieve a longer tool life and better performance in high speed cutting of Ti6Al4V alloys due to better high temperature properties.
It was noted that the hardness of TB80 was much higher than that of TB20, but the tool life of TB80 was shorter than that of TB20. The hardness of TB20 was about 20.87 GPa, which was adequate for machining relative soft metals like titanium alloy.

In the final stage, the fracture toughness of the cutting tool material would play a more important role in determining the lifetime performance. The hardness of TiB2-B4C increased with the decrease of TiB2 content, while the fracture toughness decreased. Chipping of the cutting edge would be the main failure mode of the cutting tools as TiB2 content decreased. In addition, Ti could react with B4C in vacuum at temperature above 1100 °C by the following reaction [29]: (1) 3Ti + B 4 C=TiB 2 + TiC
Reaction (1) could be initiated at a relatively lower temperature with the incorporation of air [30]. So, presumably, TiB2-B4C ceramic cutting tools with higher TiB2 content could have better cutting performance and longer tool life in cutting of Ti6Al4V alloys.

Conclusions:
TiB2–20vol%B4C (TB20) and TiB2–80vol%B4C (TB80) ceramic cutting tool materials were prepared by hot pressing. Vikers hardness of TB80 was about 27.99 GPa, 34% higher than that of TB20, whereas fracture toughness of TB80 was about 4.66 MPa m1/2, 26% lower than that of TB20. In continuous cutting of Ti6Al4V alloy, the effective cutting length of TB20 was about one third longer than that of TB80 and cemented carbide (WO). Cutting temperature increments of TB20 and TB80 from VB=0 to 600 μm were much lower than that of WO. Wear mechanism was mainly adhesive wear for TB20, adhesive wear and chipping for TB80, and adhesive wear and temperature deterioration for WO. Hard particles plunk out through detaching of adhesive layer of TB20 and TB80,while diffusion through thick workpiece layer on WO gave rise to carried away of tool materials. Compared with tungsten carbides, the high wear resistance of TiB2-B4C cutting tools were resulted from their higher hardness and lower chemical affinity with titanium. TiB2-B4C ceramic cutting tools with higher TiB2 content may have better cutting performance and longer tool life in cutting of Ti6Al4V alloys, due to the increased toughness and decreased chemical affinity with titanium.

Body:
High speed precision machining has been developed with several advantages such as high removal rates, low cutting forces, excellent dimensional accuracy [1], and surface finishing quality as well as surface integrity [2]. Titanium alloy is one of the most difficult-to-cut materials that only allows very low cutting speed to achieve adequate dimensional tolerance and surface finish in traditional cutting process. In cutting of Ti6Al4V alloys, the cutting force decreased with the increase in cutting speed because of the occurrence of conflicting work hardening–thermal softening processes with the deformation phase of the chip segment [3]. The cutting temperature would increase slightly as the cutting speed increased [4], but would increase dramatically with increasing flank wear of the cutting tools [5]. Tungsten carbide is one of the most commonly used tools for machining titanium alloys, but with increasing cutting speed, its tool life would drop rapidly due to severely unpredicted tool wear [6]. Wear mechanism of uncoated cemented carbides included adhesive wear, crater wear [7], and diffusion that would gradually become dominant as cutting speed and attrition increased [8]. Tool life of uncoated carbides would decrease to less than 2 min when cutting speed reaches 150 m/min in cutting of Ti6Al4V [9]. In order to increase cutting speed and efficiency, and improve surface finish quality, tungsten carbides with various coatings have been developed. One of them was boride coatings with high hardness and excellent thermal conductivity. In turning of Ti6Al4V, Cherukuri and Molian [10] demonstrated that AlMgB14–20%TiB2 coated carbide inserts exhibited two times longer lifetime in flank and nose wears than uncoated carbide inserts at cutting speed of 61 m/min. Corduan [11] also showed that TiB2 monolayer could be used in cutting of Ti6Al4V without problems of adhesion in relative low cutting speed. On the other hand, researchers have manufactured TiB2-based ceramic cutting tools for interest of its high hardness, high strength, high melting point, high fracture toughness, and high wear resistance [12,13]. Therefore, TiB2 based bulk cutting tools are considered to be excellent cutting tool candidate to machine high strength metals such as titanium and nickel-based alloy. However, the cutting performance of TiB2-based ceramic cutting tools has been rarely studied and reported, especially in titanium alloys, in open literatures.

The cutting performance of TiB2-B4C ceramic cutting tools in high speed turning of Ti6Al4V alloy was evaluated in the present study. The objective of this study was to provide insight into the relationship between tool life and wear mechanisms, which could in turn offer fundamental guide lines to optimize the TiB2-based ceramic cutting tools for high speed machining of difficult-to-cut materials.

TiB2-B4C composite materials were prepared from TiB2 (99.5% in purity, mean size 5 µm) and B4C (99% in purity, mean size 3 µm) powders. The composites of TB20 and TB80 with 20 and 80 vol% B4C powders, respectively, as shown in Table 1,were mixed for 24 h in a polyethylene jar using ethyl alcohol and Si3N4 balls, and dried in rotary evaporator. The dried powder mixtures were hot-pressed in graphite element resistance furnace at 2000 °C for 60 min under 30 MPa in 1 atm Ar atmosphere.

The bulk density of the sintered composites was measured using Archimedes principle in distilled water. Microstructure of the metallographic samples were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova NanoSEM430, FEI, The Netherlands), equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer analysis system (EDS) for compositional analysis. Vickers hardness was measured by the indentation method using a load of 24.5 N for 10 s on a polished surface. Fracture toughness was determined using both indentation method and single-edge notched beam (SENB) test. Fracture toughness measured by indentation method was using a Vickers indenter with an indentation load of 98 N according to the equation proposed by Anstis [14]. Fracture toughness measured by SENB test was using rectangular (25 mm × 5 mm × 2.5 mm) bars with 2.5 mm notched depth and 0.2 mm notched width, with span width of 20 mm and a crosshead displacement of 0.05 mm/min. The flexural strength was measured in a four-point bending test fixture with an inter span width of 10 mm and an outer span width of 20 mm, and a crosshead displacement of 0.5 mm/min on rectangular (25 mm × 2 mm × 1.5 mm) bars at room temperature.

The prepared TiB2-B4C materials were processed into standard cutting tools of ISO SNGN120408 (12.7 mm × 12.7 mm, 4.76 mm thickness, 0.8 mm nose radius) [15]. In addition, all inserts have a chamfered edge of 0.2 mm long with a 20° normal rake. A commercially available cobalt cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co) cutting tool, named as WO, (Zhuzhou Cemented Carbide Cutting Tools co., LTD, China) with the same geometry was also acquired for experimental comparison with TiB2-B4C cutting tools.

Only hardness and indentation toughness of WO were measured because of the limited geometry size of the tool pieces. Cutting tests were carried out on a NC (Numerical Control) lathe system (ETC3650h, China) equipped with a commercial tool holder having the geometry: rake angle γ o=−6°, clearance angle α o=6°, inclination angle λ s=−6°, side cutting edge angle K r=45°. A 100-mm-diameter cylinder Ti6Al4V alloy in the as-forged condition were used for the cutting tool evaluation (Baoti group co., LTD). Hardness of the Ti6Al4V alloy was determined as 3.83±0.03 GPa (about 40.5HRC) by indentation method with indentation load of 9.8 N for 10 s.

The tool rejection and failure criteria for the experiments were the localized flank wear (VB) > 0.6 mm and excessive chipping, flaking and/or fracturing of the cutting edge. Cutting conditions employed in this study are: cutting speeds V c in the range of 150–300 m/min, feed rates f of 0.1 mm/r, depths of cut a p of 0.5 mm. Flank wear was observed and measured using an optical microscope system linked via transducers to a digital read out. When flank wear reached 600 µm, the accumulated cutting length (L) was regarded as tool life. Cutting temperature was determined using an infrared thermal image system (TVS-500EX, NEC, Japan). Analysis of worn rake and flank regions on the tools and chemical analysis of the worn regions was performed using the scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova NanoSEM430, FEI, The Netherlands).

Microstructural analysis showed that the TB20 and TB80 composites had a homogeneous microstructure, as shown in Fig. 1. The black and grey phases were identified as B4C and TiB2, respectively. More pores were observed in TB20, compared with TB80 and this was consistent with the measurements of relative densities of TB20 and TB80, which were 95.5% and 98.1%, respectively. Microstructure of commercial WO cutting tool was also shown in Fig. 1. According to the EDS analysis in the rectangle area of Fig. 1c, Co content of the WO cutting tool was ~ 4 wt%.

Results of flexural strength, fracture toughness, and Vickers hardness of TB20 and TB80 were presented in Table 1. Flexure strength of TB20 was slightly lower than that of TB80 due to the relative low density, but fracture toughness was higher in TB20. Hardness of TB80 was 34% higher than that of TB20, due to the intrinsic high hardness of B4C phase. Vickers hardness of WO was about 15% lower than TB20, but fracture toughness of WO was about 135% higher, also seen in Table 1. It was found that mechanical properties of TB20, TB80, and WO were comparable with reported values on mechanical properties of TiB2-B4C and WC-Co materials in literatures [16–18], as shown in Table 1.

Cutting performance of TB20, TB80 and WO were studied. In general, the cutting processes were stable without catastrophic failure of the cutting edge during the machining for all of the materials evaluated. Fig. 2 showed four plots of flank wear (VB) of the three cutting tools versus cutting length (L): TB20, TB80, and WO, at four different cutting speeds: 150, 200, 250, and 300 m/min. It can be seen that the wear rates of flank wear of TB20 and TB80 were high at the beginning of machining, and then become steady state with the increase in cutting length. On the other hand, the wear rate of WO was relative slow as compared to both TB20 and TB80 in the beginning of the cutting process, but increased dramatically as the cutting length increased at the later stage of machining, possibly suggestive of the end of tool life. The progressive and stable tool-wear rate was observed in both TB20 and TB80 during the cutting process, which was in sharp contrast to that of WO tool. Result of flank wear behavior suggested that the TiB2-B4C ceramic cutting tools exhibited a much longer lifetime performance than the commercially available cemented tungsten carbide cutting tool.

Fig. 3 shows the variation in effective cutting length of the tools with varying cutting speeds. Note that the tool life defined in the present study is when the flank wear reaches 600 µm. The effective cutting length of each tool dropped dramatically with increasing cutting speed. Among three cutting tools, the TB20 had the longest tool life at each cutting speed.

The cutting temperatures corresponding to different tool flank wear were also measured. Measurements of the cutting temperature increased almost linearly with the increase of flank wear as shown in Fig. 4. At the beginning of turning when cutting tool was almost intact, the cutting temperatures of TB20, TB80, and WO were about 590 °C, 630 °C and 450 °C, respectively. When VB was about reaching 600 µm, the cutting temperature increased to about 850 °C, 840 °C and 800 °C for TB20, TB80, and WO, respectively. The temperature increment of WO was about 120 °C higher than that of TiB2-B4C cutting tools with the increase of VB from 0 to 600 µm. Temperature corresponding to each flank wear content was obtained in the very beginning of each feed after measurement of the flank wear, so temperature increment implied the damage degree of cutting edge condition. Presumably, cutting edge of WO would deteriorate severely as cutting continued, while TB20 and TB80 comparatively held a smooth wear rate.

Observations of SEM images of the wear morphology projecting toward flank face, in dry turning of Ti6Al4V at cutting speed of 250 m/min, were shown in Fig. 5. The integrity of cutting edge of TB20 (Fig. 5a) was the best as compared with that observed in TB80 (Fig. 5c) and WO (Fig. 5e), which suggested that TB20 might be still in stable wear stage. The main tool wear modes were also identified in Fig. 5. As for TiB2-B4C cutting tools, several chippings with small size were observed in TB20, and work piece material build-up was developed in the chippings (Fig. 5b). However, because of lower fracture toughness, chippings of TB80, especially in the position where in contact with work surface, were too large to be negligible. It was attributed to the work hardening of work surface of Ti6Al4V that chipping happened more severely at the boundary of the cutting edge where in contact with work surface. In the TB80, chipping mode would finally develop into notch wear (Fig. 5c) under high speed intermittent impact of harden burr of work surface. As for TB20, due to the higher toughness, chipping size was relatively small and also very minor change occurred in the cutting edge structure, thus it was less prone to introduce burr and form notch wear.

Toughness of WO was relatively much higher, so tipping would hardly happen. Nevertheless, the high-temperature resistance and high-temperature strength of cemented carbide was usually lower than TiB2-B4C ceramics, which led to high temperature deterioration of WO. As for TiB2-based, B4C-based or TiB2-B4C ceramics, considerable studies have shown that bending strength can maintain room temperature strength up to 1500 °C without reduction, or even slightly increase as temperature increasing [17,19–21]. For WC-Co composites, however, remarkable reduction in the bending strength at around 600 °C was observed, which was mainly due to the softening of the Co matrix, and further reduction at around 900 °C was predominately derived from WC softening [22–25]. As a result, the crater wear of WO was deeper when VB reached 600 µm (Fig. 5e). In addition, thermal attack in the crater from hot cutting chips gave rise to cracks and then adhesive and peel-off wear in WO (Fig. 5f).

Adhesive wear was prevalent in the rake face and flank face of WO, while adherent workpiece was most likely to gather on the small chippings and the boundary between crater and rake face of TB20 and TB80. The build-up workpiece on chippings might easily break way, but the strongly adherent pitch-like workpiece maintained an intimate and sustained contact with the rake face (Fig. 5b, d). In addition, adhesive layer could be identified as a very thin film on the flank face of TB20 and TB80. Therefore, it could be proposed that the main wear mechanism was adhesive wear for TB20, adhesive wear and chipping for TB80, and adhesive wear and temperature deterioration for WO.

Since adhesive wear was the dominant mechanism in these three tools, the detailed analysis of adhesive layer on the rake and flank face was conducted using SEM. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 showed the microstructure and element distribution of cross-section perpendicular to the cutting edge of TB20 and WO after machining at cutting speed of 250 m/min, respectively. Observations of cross-section revealed the depth of wear and the extent of the damage to the tool surface. From the SEM images, the depth of flank wear of TB20 was about 50 µm (Fig. 6a), and the depth of flank wear of WO was > 100 µm (Fig. 7a).

The white arrows in Fig. 6b and Fig. 7b corresponded to the EDS lines scan plot shown in Fig. 6c and Fig. 7c, respectively. There was a marked change in material composition from the surface of the crater of TB20 towards the tool substrate. Based on EDS data, the pitch-like adherent material with the thickness of about 30 µm came from the Ti6Al4V workpiece, Fig. 6b. In addition, the EDS data confirmed that the adhesive layer (dark) with the thickness of about 40 µm resulting from the workpiece was also observed on the crater and the flank face of WO, Fig. 7b. On the other hand, tool material particles carried away by the adhesive layer were found on the flank face of WO, and cracks that would led to a chunk of exfoliation from tool material were observed on the rake face, Fig. 7a. It was generally well accepted that the dominant wear mechanism of tungsten-carbide tools during turning of titanium alloys was adhesion resulting from dissolution and diffusion process [26]. The large forces and high temperature during cutting, combined with the high titanium chemical reactivity, would lead to diffusion and adhesion of the tool elements into the Ti6Al4V chips and at the same time for the workpiece material elements bonded onto the tool surfaces [27].

Observations showed that thinner adherent layer, better integrity of cutting edge, and more legible borderline between layer and tool bulk were evident in the TB20, which suggested that the diffusion of tool elements into the Ti6Al4V alloy was very minor even at the high cutting temperature. Nevertheless, when the intimate layer was detached from the chip or workpiece, the high adhesive forces were likely to result in the plunking out of hard particles from the tool causing its surface to become groove and crater as well as flank wear depth to increase. For ultra-hard cutting tool materials, the resistance to plastic deformation at elevated temperatures would be an important intrinsic material property [28]. In compared with tungsten-carbides, TiB2-B4C ceramics could achieve a longer tool life and better performance in high speed cutting of Ti6Al4V alloys due to better high temperature properties.

It was noted that the hardness of TB80 was much higher than that of TB20, but the tool life of TB80 was shorter than that of TB20. The hardness of TB20 was about 20.87 GPa, which was adequate for machining relative soft metals like titanium alloy. However, because of adhesive wear, the combination of crater and flank wear would undermine the integrity of cutting edge and those unsupported pieces would then break away [27]. In the final stage, the fracture toughness of the cutting tool material would play a more important role in determining the lifetime performance. The hardness of TiB2-B4C increased with the decrease of TiB2 content, while the fracture toughness decreased. Chipping of the cutting edge would be the main failure mode of the cutting tools as TiB2 content decreased. In addition, Ti could react with B4C in vacuum at temperature above 1100 °C by the following reaction [29]: (1) 3Ti + B 4 C=TiB 2 + TiC

Reaction (1) could be initiated at a relatively lower temperature with the incorporation of air [30]. So, presumably, TiB2-B4C ceramic cutting tools with higher TiB2 content could have better cutting performance and longer tool life in cutting of Ti6Al4V alloys.

TiB2–20vol%B4C (TB20) and TiB2–80vol%B4C (TB80) ceramic cutting tool materials were prepared by hot pressing. Vikers hardness of TB80 was about 27.99 GPa, 34% higher than that of TB20, whereas fracture toughness of TB80 was about 4.66 MPa m1/2, 26% lower than that of TB20. In continuous cutting of Ti6Al4V alloy, the effective cutting length of TB20 was about one third longer than that of TB80 and cemented carbide (WO). Cutting temperature increments of TB20 and TB80 from VB=0 to 600 μm were much lower than that of WO. Wear mechanism was mainly adhesive wear for TB20, adhesive wear and chipping for TB80, and adhesive wear and temperature deterioration for WO. Hard particles plunk out through detaching of adhesive layer of TB20 and TB80,while diffusion through thick workpiece layer on WO gave rise to carried away of tool materials. Compared with tungsten carbides, the high wear resistance of TiB2-B4C cutting tools were resulted from their higher hardness and lower chemical affinity with titanium. TiB2-B4C ceramic cutting tools with higher TiB2 content may have better cutting performance and longer tool life in cutting of Ti6Al4V alloys, due to the increased toughness and decreased chemical affinity with titanium.

Title:
Optical and devitrification kinetic studies of chloro-antimonate glasses

Abstract:
In this present work optical and devitrification studies of the synthesized 80 Sb2O3 –10 SrCl2 – 10 CdCl2 glasses were explored. The samples were annealed at temperature 455 °C by the different time range from 10 to 25 min with an interval of 5 min. All the synthesized samples have been characterized by spectroscopic techniques viz., UV–visible transmission, Fourier Transform Infrared transmission and Urbach plot was the complementary for the optical band gap calculation, finally the refractive index of the glass sample has been determined. The synthesized glass sample has a large optical window operating between 361 nm and 7.51 μm and has a high refractive index close to 1.7. The Urbach's plot shows that the optical band gap of the glass sample reaches a higher order value 3.25 eV. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination confirms that devitrification obeyed superficial mechanism, when controlled by the specific pre-nucleation process, which is based on self-creation of rough areas and the crystallization diffusion depth. On surface crystals formed in different morphologies like polyhedron; hemispherical (rarely); lath and needle. The progression of crystallization towards the interior is done layer by layer mode (nested lamellae) whereas the contour of the assembly is in a root mode. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shows that the crystalline structure is composed of Valentenite. The kinetic parameters such as crystallization energy (150 kJ/mol) and the Avrami's (n=3.405) index were calculated according to Chen's and Ozawa's methods. The attractive optical qualities and kinetic parameters indicate that the synthesized glass sample is a good stability against devitrification.

Introduction:
The crystallization of a glass is an exothermic phenomenon leading to the thermodynamic equilibrium of the material and is carried out by nucleation, growth, and managed by several different mechanisms [1–3]. The earliest proof of Winberg, Zanatto and Fokin [4–6] studies, addressing the fundamental aspect of nucleation whereas the Johnson - Mehl - Avrami - Kolmogorov [7] model describes the kinetics of phase transition accounting for the nucleation and growth. The crystallization of glass is a crucial importance for optimizing nano and microstructured glass-ceramics [6–17] and also making an optical fiber drawing is a technologically challenging matter [18,19]. However, Sb2O3 antimonate glasses have potential optronic applications, due to their nonlinear third order (χ3) susceptibility, low phonon energy and broad optical window i.e. from visible to mid-infrared wavelength range [20–24].
Over the past two decades the research dealing with the crystallization of antimonate based glasses; represent a limited number of articles [18,25–29]. Therefore, we gave the emphasis to the crystallization and the present article is devoted to the crystallization study of 80 Sb2O3 – 10 CdCl2 – 10 SrCl2 glasses. Before approaching the crystallization study, we proceeded to an optical characterization for the calculation of the refractive index, the limits of the optical window and the optical band gap, whereas amorphous nature and glass transition temperature details were reported in our previous article [20].
In the present studies a crystallization annealing temperature 455 °C has been applied to the four vitreous samples to the treatment time varies from 10 min to 25 min by an interval of 5 min. The mechanisms of crystal growth and morphologies have been explored by using SEM studies and also crystallization of the glasses was discussed. X-ray diffraction pattern has shown that glass crystallizes in Valentinite the one of the allotropic forms of antimonate.
The final part of the present work is emphases to the determination of the kinetic parameters of crystallization, namely the crystallization activation energy and the Avrami's index by using the Chen's [30], Ozawa's [31] methods for different heating rates via Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements.

Experimental:
Glass sample synthesis is carried out with reagent grade chemicals, following melt-quenching method and the details are mentioned in our previous work [20]. The refractive index of the prepared sample was determined by measuring the critical angle Θc for the sample/prism interface using different laser beam wavelengths, especially 633 nm; 1311 nm and 1551 nm by using the instrument Metricon-2010 model. This apparatus operates as a refractometer, providing accurate measurement of refractive index (±0.001). The prism index must be higher than the expected glass index, for total internal reflection of the input beam will occur, and the detector will receive a large intensity. It is important to note that adequate pressure must be applied between the prism and glass for coupling to occur. This pressure serves to minimize the air gap between the two materials, resulting a maximum coupling between the prism and sample. Optical transmission in the UV–visible range was recorded between 350 nm and 800 nm by a PerkinElmer spectrophotometer. Infrared absorption spectrum was measured between 400 cm−1 and 4000 cm−1 using a TENSOR 37 FTIR Infrared spectrophotometer.
We have given to four bulk samples of glass composition 80 Sb2O3 – 10 CdCl2 – 10 SrCl2 an isothermal annealing for devitrification at temperature 455 °C and it corresponds to TX + 5 °C (TX=onset point of crystallization) with respect to the crystallization peak at heating rate 2 °C/min. The annealing is done in chamber furnace with Nabertherm model. After heating, each sample was quenched in fresh air for conserving the structure at fixed times.
The only variable in this process is the treatment time and is taken as 10 min; 15 min; 20 min and 25 min. Before treatment the four samples have the same temperature and the samples have a disk shape with the diameter 10 mm and the thickness 5 mm. Each sample must be broken in two pieces by bending and then conferred a gold sputter deposit to facilitate the SEM examination. The micrographs were made both for the surface and the transverse side. JEOL JSM 840 model with a voltage of 7 kV is used for the SEM measurements. In other side DSC measurements were made for four different heating rates 2; 4; 6; and 8 K/min for the kinetic study. A DSC apparatus of Q2O model with sensitivity 0.1 °C with the argon atmosphere installation has been employed in the thermal studies. In these measurements we have encapsulated the coarse particles of glass within the well-sealed aluminum crucibles. XRD pattern is taken from a crystallized sample at room temperature by a Bruker D8 type diffractometer and the measuring is carried out by copper Kα radiation at the 1.54 A° wavelength. The generator settings are under 40 kV, and 40 mA voltage and current respectively. The standard scanning angle (2θ) is done from 8° to 90°; with step size of 0.02°.

Results And Discussion:
3.1 Optical properties The preliminary results (reported in Table 1 ) of this study related to the fundamental optical properties of the prepared glass sample. The energy band gap between the valence and conduction electronic layers of a material affects the UV–visible and can be determined by the Urbach method. From the UV–visible transmission curve (Fig. 1 ) the cut-off wavelength361 nm is determined by extrapolation the tangent for intercepting the x-axis. Similarly, the optical gap energy 3.25 eV is determined by the Tauc plot (Fig. 2 ) [32]. The multiphonon relaxation wavelength 7.61 μm corresponds to the zero value of infrared transmission is as shown in Fig. 3 . The infrared transmission curve has absorption bands consecutive to OH contamination between 3500 and 3200 cm−1 and SiO at the limit of 1800 cm−1. The presence of OH alters the optical window of the glass, and infrared transmission begins practically after this absorption band, starting at 3200 cm−1. These effects can be reduced with the use of a gold crucible and the addition of fluorinated agent during the synthesis of the glass in order to release hydrogen as shown by the following chemical reaction: F − + O H − → H F ↑ + O 2 − Refractive index measurements of a prepared sample show a little bit high value around 1.7 this value exceed those of conventional glasses. 3.1.1 Sample 1- Review at 10 min After 10 min in annealing; we found that the crystallization occurs only on the surface, in prime areas. Fig. 4 .a shows the appearance of roughness of the glass surface and also observed their multiplication in other superficial area and a crystal growth takes place in this rough zone. It has formed a polyhedron and hemispherical shapes (Fig. 4.b). Another type of lath-shaped crystals is formed in the surface cavities (Fig. 4.c). In this process, the crystallization phenomenon remains confined in favors sites in surface and do not diffuse in the depth of the sample. 3.1.2 Sample 2- Review at 15 min 15 min afterwards the crystallization starts from the surface and diffuse in the depth of the sample, as shown in Fig. 5 .a. It is noted that the crystal growth is done by nested lamella. Whole crystalline region is taking the root form, since the length of the lamella decreases from the surface to the depth. The micrograph of Fig. 5.b shows an intense surface crystalline development, as needles and laths-like randomly oriented and interfere with each other. Fig. 5.c micrograph further clarifies this situation under high magnification. 3.1.3 Sample 3- Review at 20 min Later 20 min, polyhedral crystals are formed in rough and smooth surface areas (Fig. 6 .a, b). Therefore crystallization on a smooth area appears late compared to that in a rough area. In Fig. 6.c, we found that the crystallization propagates in different directions towards the sample's core. This crystalline development starts from the same zone of germination of the superficial crystals. In this case the crystalline growth towards the depth is most intense with respect to the sample (2), whereas crystallization has been developed in isolated root. 3.1.4 Sample 4- Review at 25 min In the next 25 min, the glass surface is completely covered by a crystalline film of thickness 70 μm (Fig. 7 .a). Fig. 7.b represents a magnification of the previous one; where lamellar crystals formant roots and this process leads the meeting of lamella of two adjacent roots. At this stage crystal/glass interfaces disappear, however the volume fraction of amorphous phase decreases. This process decreases the free energy of the system and makes it more stable. Fig. 7.c presents the opportunity for a more detail on the surface where the coalescence of different crystals is covered on the surface.
3.2 X ray diffraction [sample (5); treated at 455 °C] Fig. 8.a & 8. b show the XRD patterns and the peaks are listed with the associate phase. However the identified structure is Valentinite, it is orthorhombic variety of antimonate Sb2O3. We used software installed in the machine for phase determination. Peaks research met the following criteria: Minimum significance=2, Minimum tip width=0.01, Maximum tip width=1, Peak base width=2 and the method is second derivative minimum.
3.3 Crystallization kinetic study We emphasis a non-isothermal study for the determination of the kinetic parameters of glass's crystallization. DSC measurements were made for four heating rates, as shown in Fig. 9 .a. Table 2 reports the data extracted from the DSC curves, which are needed to calculate the crystallization energy and the Avrami's index. The peak area of crystallization is limited between the baseline of DSC and the heat flux curve. The crystallization energy was calculated by linear regression at TP (temperature at a maximum flux of crystallization's peak); using Chen's [30] and Ozawa's [31] formulas (equations (1) and (2) respectively): (1) d l n ( T 2 / α ) d ( 1 / T ) | X=E R (2) d l n α d ( 1 / T ) | X=− E R Where, E=crystallization energy, T=temperature, α=heating rate and R=ideal gas constant. X=the fraction transformed during crystallization; and it is equal to the ratio of the partial and total areas of crystallization peak. Fig. 9.b shows the regressions where the crystallization energy equals 143.72 KJ/mol according to Chen and 156.53 KJ/mol according to Ozawa. The Avrami's index is calculated by linear regression of the Ozawa's [31] formula (equation (3)): (3) d ( ln ( − ln ( 1 − X ) ) d ( l n α ) | T=− n Where, n=Avrami's index. Fig. 9.c represents a plot of experimental data and their associate linear fittings used to determine the Avrami's indexes. These values are listed in Table 3 and the average of these values is 3.405. Usually this value indicates that the crystallization is made by interface-controlled and rate-increasing two dimensional nucleation mode. The chloro-antimonate 80 Sb2O3 -10 CdCl2 -10 SrCl2 glass has interesting optical qualities. In particular its large optical window, which covers the visible range to mid-infrared. This property is a consequence of low phonon energy 600 cm−1 of the Sb–O bond [22]. The high value of the refractive index depends on the polarizability of the glassy former [20]. A high refractive index increases the probability of radiative transitions in glass matrices doped with lanthanides. These aspects make the study of mechanism and kinetics of crystallization of paramount importance. The SEM examination confirms that the devitrification of the 80 Sb2O3 –10 SrCl2 – 10 CdCl2 glasses obeys the surface mechanism. Devitrification begins at specific sites on the surface and the main process consists of the formation of roughness and also which constitute favorable sites for the germination and growth of polyhedral crystals. The roughness appear in a limited area and then widens, following the thermal agitation of the super cooled liquid. From our point of view, the three concepts, namely, the kinetic theory of liquids, model describing surface and the theory explaining the creation of surface roughness following the matter exchange are necessary to explain this phenomenon. In the kinetic theory of liquids, atoms on the surface have low bond energy. They migrate under thermal agitation, which creates vacancies allowing the atoms of sub-adjacent layers to fill them [33]. At the atomic scale the surface of a material can be described by the TLK model (terrace - ledge - kink) and TSK model (terrace - step - kink) [34,35]. According to Elwell and Scheel [36] the arrival of material flow at the surface leads to the formation of clusters or bunches of steps (step is an element of TSK model) which will form a rough surface on a microscopic scale. The latter offers the diffusing entity several possibilities of chemical bonds, which initiate nucleation and growth. Therefore the crystallization process on rough surfaces is faster compared to smooth surfaces. The crystallization catalyst roughness appear spontaneously by thermal effect and constitutes a pre-nucleation process distinguishing chloro-antimonate glass. But amorphous phase separation (APS) and spinodal decomposition constitute the pre-nucleation processes for certain classic and special glasses. APS and spinodal decomposition appear throughout the volume [1,11]. On the other hand the mechanism of pre-nucleation of chloro-antimonate glass is of a superficial nature. Surface defects (at the micron scale) such as cavities and porosities are precursors to the germination and growth of crystals in the form of laths-like and needles. We believe that it is the confinement of roughness at the tips of these defects which promotes one-dimensional or pseudo one-dimensional (lath-like) crystal growth. Generally the value of the Avrami's index n=3.405 indicates that the growth is done by the exchange at the interface with a decreasing nucleation rate [37]. Depending on the specificity of the case physically there are other alternatives associated with this value. Indeed, high values of Avrami's index 3 ≤ n ≤ 4 can represent a specific mode of rapid crystallization. We cite the formation of precipitates in grain boundaries, and crystal growth on impurities [38]. In our case the rough zones accelerate and dominate the crystallization on the surface and also the calculated value of the Avrami's index n=3.405. The calculated values of the crystallization energy have a high energy barrier to crystallization; promoting good stability of the studied glass. However the lamellar growth mechanism inside the glass requires a large number of interfaces in molar volume; and increases the energy barrier. Each time additional energy require to form a new interface between lamellae. The DSC analysis presents a single crystallization peak for the different heating rates and X-ray diffraction patterns shows that the glass crystallizes into valentinite. The single-phase nature of the crystallization is returned to the quantitative dominance of antimonate (80% Sb2O3) and good solubility of the cadmium and strontium chlorides in this matrix. Indeed valentinite plays the role of solvent and the chlorides are the solutes.

Optical Properties:
The preliminary results (reported in Table 1 ) of this study related to the fundamental optical properties of the prepared glass sample. The energy band gap between the valence and conduction electronic layers of a material affects the UV–visible and can be determined by the Urbach method. From the UV–visible transmission curve (Fig. 1 ) the cut-off wavelength361 nm is determined by extrapolation the tangent for intercepting the x-axis. Similarly, the optical gap energy 3.25 eV is determined by the Tauc plot (Fig. 2 ) [32]. The multiphonon relaxation wavelength 7.61 μm corresponds to the zero value of infrared transmission is as shown in Fig. 3 .
The infrared transmission curve has absorption bands consecutive to OH contamination between 3500 and 3200 cm−1 and SiO at the limit of 1800 cm−1. The presence of OH alters the optical window of the glass, and infrared transmission begins practically after this absorption band, starting at 3200 cm−1. These effects can be reduced with the use of a gold crucible and the addition of fluorinated agent during the synthesis of the glass in order to release hydrogen as shown by the following chemical reaction: F − + O H − → H F ↑ + O 2 −
Refractive index measurements of a prepared sample show a little bit high value around 1.7 this value exceed those of conventional glasses.

Conclusion:
80 Sb2O3 –10 SrCl2 – 10 CdCl2 glasses have been prepared by using melt quenching method and at 455 °C annealing temperature the crystallization of four glass samples were studied. The chloro-antimonate glass has a large optical window of cut-off wavelength 361 nm, multiphonons relaxation wavelength 7.51 μm, high optical band gap 3.25 eV and a high refractive index close to 1.7 in the visible and near infrared. The devitrification study remains complementary and essential in order to assess the conditions of application of the glass. SEM micrographs are noted at different treatment times between 10 and 25 min. Crystallization starts on the surface crystals of different morphology viz., polyhedral, needle, lath-like and rarely hemispherical. The surface porosity promotes the formation of needle crystals, while those in lath-like are developed in the cavities. The germination and growth of polyhedral crystals take place in rough areas of the surface. Roughness is a pre-germination process; and it accelerates crystallization compared to smooth surfaces.
Crystallization develops from the surface towards the interior in the form of overlapping lamellae and are grouped together in sets, each has the outer profile of a root. Growth takes place in transverse directions until the lamellae of different roots meet. After 25 min of annealing, a crystalline film is formed covering the surface with an average thickness of 70 μm. X-ray diffraction pattern shows the single-phase nature of the crystallization structure in the form of Valentinite. The kinetic parameters of crystallization via DSC measurements were calculated for different heating rates 2, 4, 6 and 8 °C/min and the average crystallization energy is found 150 KJ/mol shows good stability against devitrification. The Arami's index has an average value 3.405 attributes to crystallization in rough areas of the surface.

Body:
The crystallization of a glass is an exothermic phenomenon leading to the thermodynamic equilibrium of the material and is carried out by nucleation, growth, and managed by several different mechanisms [1–3]. The earliest proof of Winberg, Zanatto and Fokin [4–6] studies, addressing the fundamental aspect of nucleation whereas the Johnson - Mehl - Avrami - Kolmogorov [7] model describes the kinetics of phase transition accounting for the nucleation and growth. The crystallization of glass is a crucial importance for optimizing nano and microstructured glass-ceramics [6–17] and also making an optical fiber drawing is a technologically challenging matter [18,19]. However, Sb2O3 antimonate glasses have potential optronic applications, due to their nonlinear third order (χ3) susceptibility, low phonon energy and broad optical window i.e. from visible to mid-infrared wavelength range [20–24].

Over the past two decades the research dealing with the crystallization of antimonate based glasses; represent a limited number of articles [18,25–29]. Therefore, we gave the emphasis to the crystallization and the present article is devoted to the crystallization study of 80 Sb2O3 – 10 CdCl2 – 10 SrCl2 glasses. Before approaching the crystallization study, we proceeded to an optical characterization for the calculation of the refractive index, the limits of the optical window and the optical band gap, whereas amorphous nature and glass transition temperature details were reported in our previous article [20].

In the present studies a crystallization annealing temperature 455 °C has been applied to the four vitreous samples to the treatment time varies from 10 min to 25 min by an interval of 5 min. The mechanisms of crystal growth and morphologies have been explored by using SEM studies and also crystallization of the glasses was discussed. X-ray diffraction pattern has shown that glass crystallizes in Valentinite the one of the allotropic forms of antimonate.

The final part of the present work is emphases to the determination of the kinetic parameters of crystallization, namely the crystallization activation energy and the Avrami's index by using the Chen's [30], Ozawa's [31] methods for different heating rates via Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements.

Glass sample synthesis is carried out with reagent grade chemicals, following melt-quenching method and the details are mentioned in our previous work [20]. The refractive index of the prepared sample was determined by measuring the critical angle Θc for the sample/prism interface using different laser beam wavelengths, especially 633 nm; 1311 nm and 1551 nm by using the instrument Metricon-2010 model. This apparatus operates as a refractometer, providing accurate measurement of refractive index (±0.001). The prism index must be higher than the expected glass index, for total internal reflection of the input beam will occur, and the detector will receive a large intensity. It is important to note that adequate pressure must be applied between the prism and glass for coupling to occur. This pressure serves to minimize the air gap between the two materials, resulting a maximum coupling between the prism and sample. Optical transmission in the UV–visible range was recorded between 350 nm and 800 nm by a PerkinElmer spectrophotometer. Infrared absorption spectrum was measured between 400 cm−1 and 4000 cm−1 using a TENSOR 37 FTIR Infrared spectrophotometer.

We have given to four bulk samples of glass composition 80 Sb2O3 – 10 CdCl2 – 10 SrCl2 an isothermal annealing for devitrification at temperature 455 °C and it corresponds to TX + 5 °C (TX=onset point of crystallization) with respect to the crystallization peak at heating rate 2 °C/min. The annealing is done in chamber furnace with Nabertherm model. After heating, each sample was quenched in fresh air for conserving the structure at fixed times.

The only variable in this process is the treatment time and is taken as 10 min; 15 min; 20 min and 25 min. Before treatment the four samples have the same temperature and the samples have a disk shape with the diameter 10 mm and the thickness 5 mm. Each sample must be broken in two pieces by bending and then conferred a gold sputter deposit to facilitate the SEM examination. The micrographs were made both for the surface and the transverse side. JEOL JSM 840 model with a voltage of 7 kV is used for the SEM measurements. In other side DSC measurements were made for four different heating rates 2; 4; 6; and 8 K/min for the kinetic study. A DSC apparatus of Q2O model with sensitivity 0.1 °C with the argon atmosphere installation has been employed in the thermal studies. In these measurements we have encapsulated the coarse particles of glass within the well-sealed aluminum crucibles. XRD pattern is taken from a crystallized sample at room temperature by a Bruker D8 type diffractometer and the measuring is carried out by copper Kα radiation at the 1.54 A° wavelength. The generator settings are under 40 kV, and 40 mA voltage and current respectively. The standard scanning angle (2θ) is done from 8° to 90°; with step size of 0.02°.

The preliminary results (reported in Table 1 ) of this study related to the fundamental optical properties of the prepared glass sample. The energy band gap between the valence and conduction electronic layers of a material affects the UV–visible and can be determined by the Urbach method. From the UV–visible transmission curve (Fig. 1 ) the cut-off wavelength361 nm is determined by extrapolation the tangent for intercepting the x-axis. Similarly, the optical gap energy 3.25 eV is determined by the Tauc plot (Fig. 2 ) [32]. The multiphonon relaxation wavelength 7.61 μm corresponds to the zero value of infrared transmission is as shown in Fig. 3 .

The infrared transmission curve has absorption bands consecutive to OH contamination between 3500 and 3200 cm−1 and SiO at the limit of 1800 cm−1. The presence of OH alters the optical window of the glass, and infrared transmission begins practically after this absorption band, starting at 3200 cm−1. These effects can be reduced with the use of a gold crucible and the addition of fluorinated agent during the synthesis of the glass in order to release hydrogen as shown by the following chemical reaction: F − + O H − → H F ↑ + O 2 −

Refractive index measurements of a prepared sample show a little bit high value around 1.7 this value exceed those of conventional glasses.

After 10 min in annealing; we found that the crystallization occurs only on the surface, in prime areas. Fig. 4 .a shows the appearance of roughness of the glass surface and also observed their multiplication in other superficial area and a crystal growth takes place in this rough zone. It has formed a polyhedron and hemispherical shapes (Fig. 4.b). Another type of lath-shaped crystals is formed in the surface cavities (Fig. 4.c). In this process, the crystallization phenomenon remains confined in favors sites in surface and do not diffuse in the depth of the sample.

15 min afterwards the crystallization starts from the surface and diffuse in the depth of the sample, as shown in Fig. 5 .a. It is noted that the crystal growth is done by nested lamella. Whole crystalline region is taking the root form, since the length of the lamella decreases from the surface to the depth. The micrograph of Fig. 5.b shows an intense surface crystalline development, as needles and laths-like randomly oriented and interfere with each other. Fig. 5.c micrograph further clarifies this situation under high magnification.

Later 20 min, polyhedral crystals are formed in rough and smooth surface areas (Fig. 6 .a, b). Therefore crystallization on a smooth area appears late compared to that in a rough area. In Fig. 6.c, we found that the crystallization propagates in different directions towards the sample's core. This crystalline development starts from the same zone of germination of the superficial crystals. In this case the crystalline growth towards the depth is most intense with respect to the sample (2), whereas crystallization has been developed in isolated root.

In the next 25 min, the glass surface is completely covered by a crystalline film of thickness 70 μm (Fig. 7 .a). Fig. 7.b represents a magnification of the previous one; where lamellar crystals formant roots and this process leads the meeting of lamella of two adjacent roots. At this stage crystal/glass interfaces disappear, however the volume fraction of amorphous phase decreases. This process decreases the free energy of the system and makes it more stable. Fig. 7.c presents the opportunity for a more detail on the surface where the coalescence of different crystals is covered on the surface.

Fig. 8.a & 8. b show the XRD patterns and the peaks are listed with the associate phase. However the identified structure is Valentinite, it is orthorhombic variety of antimonate Sb2O3. We used software installed in the machine for phase determination. Peaks research met the following criteria:

Minimum significance=2, Minimum tip width=0.01, Maximum tip width=1, Peak base width=2 and the method is second derivative minimum.

We emphasis a non-isothermal study for the determination of the kinetic parameters of glass's crystallization. DSC measurements were made for four heating rates, as shown in Fig. 9 .a. Table 2 reports the data extracted from the DSC curves, which are needed to calculate the crystallization energy and the Avrami's index. The peak area of crystallization is limited between the baseline of DSC and the heat flux curve.

The crystallization energy was calculated by linear regression at TP (temperature at a maximum flux of crystallization's peak); using Chen's [30] and Ozawa's [31] formulas (equations (1) and (2) respectively): (1) d l n ( T 2 / α ) d ( 1 / T ) | X=E R (2) d l n α d ( 1 / T ) | X=− E R Where, E=crystallization energy, T=temperature, α=heating rate and R=ideal gas constant. X=the fraction transformed during crystallization; and it is equal to the ratio of the partial and total areas of crystallization peak.

Where, E=crystallization energy, T=temperature, α=heating rate and R=ideal gas constant.

X=the fraction transformed during crystallization; and it is equal to the ratio of the partial and total areas of crystallization peak.

Fig. 9.b shows the regressions where the crystallization energy equals 143.72 KJ/mol according to Chen and 156.53 KJ/mol according to Ozawa. The Avrami's index is calculated by linear regression of the Ozawa's [31] formula (equation (3)): (3) d ( ln ( − ln ( 1 − X ) ) d ( l n α ) | T=− n Where, n=Avrami's index.

Fig. 9.c represents a plot of experimental data and their associate linear fittings used to determine the Avrami's indexes. These values are listed in Table 3 and the average of these values is 3.405. Usually this value indicates that the crystallization is made by interface-controlled and rate-increasing two dimensional nucleation mode.

The chloro-antimonate 80 Sb2O3 -10 CdCl2 -10 SrCl2 glass has interesting optical qualities. In particular its large optical window, which covers the visible range to mid-infrared. This property is a consequence of low phonon energy 600 cm−1 of the Sb–O bond [22]. The high value of the refractive index depends on the polarizability of the glassy former [20]. A high refractive index increases the probability of radiative transitions in glass matrices doped with lanthanides. These aspects make the study of mechanism and kinetics of crystallization of paramount importance.

The SEM examination confirms that the devitrification of the 80 Sb2O3 –10 SrCl2 – 10 CdCl2 glasses obeys the surface mechanism. Devitrification begins at specific sites on the surface and the main process consists of the formation of roughness and also which constitute favorable sites for the germination and growth of polyhedral crystals. The roughness appear in a limited area and then widens, following the thermal agitation of the super cooled liquid. From our point of view, the three concepts, namely, the kinetic theory of liquids, model describing surface and the theory explaining the creation of surface roughness following the matter exchange are necessary to explain this phenomenon. In the kinetic theory of liquids, atoms on the surface have low bond energy. They migrate under thermal agitation, which creates vacancies allowing the atoms of sub-adjacent layers to fill them [33]. At the atomic scale the surface of a material can be described by the TLK model (terrace - ledge - kink) and TSK model (terrace - step - kink) [34,35].

According to Elwell and Scheel [36] the arrival of material flow at the surface leads to the formation of clusters or bunches of steps (step is an element of TSK model) which will form a rough surface on a microscopic scale. The latter offers the diffusing entity several possibilities of chemical bonds, which initiate nucleation and growth. Therefore the crystallization process on rough surfaces is faster compared to smooth surfaces. The crystallization catalyst roughness appear spontaneously by thermal effect and constitutes a pre-nucleation process distinguishing chloro-antimonate glass. But amorphous phase separation (APS) and spinodal decomposition constitute the pre-nucleation processes for certain classic and special glasses. APS and spinodal decomposition appear throughout the volume [1,11]. On the other hand the mechanism of pre-nucleation of chloro-antimonate glass is of a superficial nature. Surface defects (at the micron scale) such as cavities and porosities are precursors to the germination and growth of crystals in the form of laths-like and needles. We believe that it is the confinement of roughness at the tips of these defects which promotes one-dimensional or pseudo one-dimensional (lath-like) crystal growth.

Generally the value of the Avrami's index n=3.405 indicates that the growth is done by the exchange at the interface with a decreasing nucleation rate [37]. Depending on the specificity of the case physically there are other alternatives associated with this value. Indeed, high values of Avrami's index 3 ≤ n ≤ 4 can represent a specific mode of rapid crystallization. We cite the formation of precipitates in grain boundaries, and crystal growth on impurities [38]. In our case the rough zones accelerate and dominate the crystallization on the surface and also the calculated value of the Avrami's index n=3.405.

The calculated values of the crystallization energy have a high energy barrier to crystallization; promoting good stability of the studied glass. However the lamellar growth mechanism inside the glass requires a large number of interfaces in molar volume; and increases the energy barrier. Each time additional energy require to form a new interface between lamellae. The DSC analysis presents a single crystallization peak for the different heating rates and X-ray diffraction patterns shows that the glass crystallizes into valentinite. The single-phase nature of the crystallization is returned to the quantitative dominance of antimonate (80% Sb2O3) and good solubility of the cadmium and strontium chlorides in this matrix. Indeed valentinite plays the role of solvent and the chlorides are the solutes.

80 Sb2O3 –10 SrCl2 – 10 CdCl2 glasses have been prepared by using melt quenching method and at 455 °C annealing temperature the crystallization of four glass samples were studied. The chloro-antimonate glass has a large optical window of cut-off wavelength 361 nm, multiphonons relaxation wavelength 7.51 μm, high optical band gap 3.25 eV and a high refractive index close to 1.7 in the visible and near infrared. The devitrification study remains complementary and essential in order to assess the conditions of application of the glass. SEM micrographs are noted at different treatment times between 10 and 25 min. Crystallization starts on the surface crystals of different morphology viz., polyhedral, needle, lath-like and rarely hemispherical. The surface porosity promotes the formation of needle crystals, while those in lath-like are developed in the cavities. The germination and growth of polyhedral crystals take place in rough areas of the surface. Roughness is a pre-germination process; and it accelerates crystallization compared to smooth surfaces.

Crystallization develops from the surface towards the interior in the form of overlapping lamellae and are grouped together in sets, each has the outer profile of a root. Growth takes place in transverse directions until the lamellae of different roots meet. After 25 min of annealing, a crystalline film is formed covering the surface with an average thickness of 70 μm. X-ray diffraction pattern shows the single-phase nature of the crystallization structure in the form of Valentinite. The kinetic parameters of crystallization via DSC measurements were calculated for different heating rates 2, 4, 6 and 8 °C/min and the average crystallization energy is found 150 KJ/mol shows good stability against devitrification. The Arami's index has an average value 3.405 attributes to crystallization in rough areas of the surface.

Title:
Ultra-stable X9R type CaCu

Abstract:
CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 (x=0.00, 0.05 and 0.10) precursor powders were prepared by the polymer pyrolysis (PP) solution method. Ultra-stable X9R type capacitor with very low loss tangent (tanδ) ~0.017 varied within a value of less than 0.05 in a wide temperature range of −60 to 150 °C and high dielectric constants (ε ′) ~9200 with Δε′ ≤±15% in a wide temperature range of −60 to 210 °C was achieved in CaCu2.95Zn0.05Ti4.1O12 (Zn05-1) ceramic obtained by sintering the precursor powder (x=0.05) at 1060 °C for 8 h. A major role for the validity of ε ′ and tanδ in these wider temperature ranges was suggested to originated from the very high grain boundary resistance (R gb ~413,190 Ω cm), resulting from the effect of Zn2+ doping and TiO2-rich at grain boundary. With the excellent dielectric properties of (Zn05-1) ceramic, it was suggested to be applied for X8R and X9R capacitors. Interestingly, improvements of nonlinear properties with very high nonlinear coefficient (α ~ 25.94) and breakdown field (E b ~ 3146.25 V.cm−1) values were achieved in (Zn05-1) ceramic, as well.

Introduction:
So far, investigation on the improvement of dielectric and electrical properties with the temperature stability of dielectric constant (Δε ′=100 ×(ε ′ T-ε ′ 30 °C)/ ε ′ 30 °C) of the CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) [1–9] and related compounds [10–12] have been continuously studied and become even more attractive issue for researchers. Although these dielectric materials have been extensively investigated, however it was infrequently successful to achieve all requirements of very high dielectric performance in a wide temperature and frequency range, especially for the X8R and X9R capacitors. In general, the EIA code X8R and X9R capacitors are operated at a temperature higher than 125 °C without external cooling, which is a requirement for aerospace, military mobile communications and energy production industries [13]. In addition, it is specific that the condition of Δε ′ to satisfy for X8R and X9R capacitors should be less than±15% in a temperature range of −55 to 150 °C and −55 to 200 °C, respectively. Accordingly, investigation for X8R capacitors has been extensively studied and there are only a few articles that reported for CCTO-based compound [2,14,15]. However, there are no reports for X9R capacitor based on CCTO ceramic materials. Generally, X9R capacitors have been intensively studied and reported in ferroelectric perovskite compounds [13,16], normally sintered at high temperature, which is a disadvantage of the preparation process due to high energy consumption and might probably cause a seriously environmental problem. In order to improve the dielectric and electrical properties with a novel satisfy condition for Δε ′ of CCTO-based compound to meet the X8R and X9R capacitors, many approaches have been proposed for the preparation of the materials such as (1) doping and co-doping with various metals in CCTO ceramics to improve the electrical properties of grain boundaries (GBs) [2,17–19], (2) doping with some metals in CCTO/CaTiO3 composites [15,20], (3) using appropriate sintering conditions to enhance GB layers [21–23] and (4) increasing the Ti molar concentration in CCTO compound to produce TiO2-rich CCTO ceramics [24–27], Among these approaches, (1), (2) and (3) are the most ones that have been intensively reported [15,17–19,28,29] with a few of them that can successfully achieve for X8R capacitors such as the studies on Mg2+ doped CCTO/CaTiO3 [15], La3+ doped CCTO [8] and Zn-doping CCTO [2]. Furthermore, the study by approach (4) reported only the dielectric properties at room temperature without the study of Δε ′. For instance, Lin and coworkers [25] reported the effect of TiO2-rich in the microstructure and dielectric properties of CCTO (CaCu3Ti4+xO12; x=0.00–1.5) ceramics prepared by solid state reaction method. They found that TiO2 impurity phase trended to increase with increasing Ti content, resulting in the decrease of ε ′ and tanδ values to ~4233 and ~0.03, respectively. In addition to this, the nonlinear J–E properties could be improved as well. Ouyang and coworkers [24] reported the dielectric properties (ε ′ ~5.5 ×104 and tanδ ~0.2) of TiO2-rich CCTO ceramics derived by a sol gel method. Hao and coworkers [30] reported the preparation of CCTO/xTiO2 (x=0.0–2.0) ceramics by using a sol gel technique and found that the tanδ and ε ′ values decreased with increasing Ti content, due to the presence of TiO2 secondary phase. Other than this, it was also found that the CCTO/TiO2 composite ceramics had an advantage over the ferroelectric perovskite materials, because it could be prepared by a one-step process from a nominal CaCu3Ti4+xO12 composition [24,25] with sintering temperature lower than that of ferroelectric perovskite compounds. Consequently, it will be superior that the dielectric properties, nonlinear characteristics and Δε ′ of the CCTO/TiO2 ceramics can be concurrently improved with a novel innovation that might support the capacitors technology. Recently, it was also found that Zn2+ doping in CCTO-based ceramics [2,31–34] and co-doping with others metal [19,35] could improve not only the electrical properties, but also simultaneously enhance the Δε ′. For instance, high performance dielectric properties with the satisfy Δε ′ for X8R capacitor could be achieved in the Zn2+ ions doped CaCu2Ti4O12 ceramics [2]. According to this report and literature, it is supposed that Zn2+-doped CaCu2Ti4O12/TiO2 ceramics could simultaneously improve the dielectric properties with the satisfy Δε ′ for the X8R and X9R capacitors.
In this work, CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 (x=0.00, 0.05 and 0.10) precursor powders were prepared by the polymer pyrolysis (PP) solution method [9,20]. Effect of Zn2+ doping on the dielectric properties, nonlinear (J–E curve) characteristics and Δε ′ of all ceramic samples prepared from these precursor powders were studied and discussed based on the promotion of oxygen vacancy at grain boundary (GB). Interestingly, excellent dielectric properties (ε ′ ~9200 and tanδ ~0.017) with a wide valid temperature range (ΔT) of −60 to 210 °C for Δε′ ≤±15% and −60 to 150 °C for tanδ ≤ 0.05 were achieved. Moreover, the highest value of α (~49.66) and E b (~13146.25 V.cm−1) were obtained in this study. In order to elucidate the effect of Zn2+ ions on the dielectric properties and nonlinear characteristics of all prepared ceramic samples, impedance spectroscopy were performed.

Experimental:
CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 (x=0.00, 0.05 and 0.10, abbreviated as Ti01, Zn05 and Zn10, respectively) powders were prepared by the PP method. Acrylic acid (CH2=CHCOOH, Sigma Aldrich), Ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O4), Calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O), Zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), Copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) and Titanium solution (C16H28O6Ti 75 wt% in isopropanol) were employed as starting materials. The complete details of the PP method were described in our previous work [9]. The pellets of Ti01, Zn05 and Zn10 samples with approximate thickness of 1 mm and diameter of 9 mm were prepared by using the uniaxial compression at ~50 MPa. These pellet samples were sintered in air at two different sintering conditions of 1060 °C for 8 h (abbreviated as Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics) and 1100 °C for 5 h (abbreviated as Ti01-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics).
Microstructure and elemental mapping of ceramic samples were explored by scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6510LV, Oxford Instrument) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDXS). Standard line intercept technique was used to calculate the average grain sizes (AGs) of ceramic samples. Phase compositions were investigated by X-ray diffraction (Bruker/D8 Advance; Bruker BioSpin AG; λ=0.15406 nm). Prior to measurements of dielectric properties and nonlinear J–E curves, all ceramic pellets were polished and cleaned on both sides to obtain the smooth surfaces. Subsequently, both surfaces were coated with Au using a sputtering unit (Polaron SC500). Dielectric properties were measured in a wide temperature (−60 to 210 °C) and frequency (100 Hz to 1 MHz) ranges using an impedance gain phase analyzer (Hewlett Packard 4194A). Nonlinear J–E curves were examined at 30 °C using a high voltage measurement unit (Keithley Model 247). Two important values of nonlinear characteristics i.e. breakdown electric field (E b ) and nonlinear coefficient (α) were determined by a method described in our previous work [21,36]. The oxidation state of Ti ion in ceramic samples were verified using X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, Multiple X-ray, Energy 4–18 keV, Current 100 mA, 107–1010 photon s−1). The percentage of Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio in all ceramic samples was calculated using equation provided in our previous work [36]. The complete details of XANES technique and data analysis were described elsewhere [37,38].

Results And Discussion:
Fig. 1(a)–(f) display the Rietveld refinement profile fits (RRPFs) [39] of the XRD patterns of all ceramic samples, which can be identified to correspond with the standard data for CaCu3Ti4O12 (ICSD card No.95714), having the body center cubic (bcc) structure. As expected, a minor peak of TiO2 phase (ICSD card No. 26715) is observed in the XRD patterns of all Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics with no detection of ZnO impurity phase due to the insensitivity of the XRD technique to any phase of concentration less than 0.5 wt% [40,41]. According to the RRPFs, the CaCu3Ti4O12:TiO2 ratios of Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1, T101-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics were determined and found to be 100.0:0.0, 97.9:2.1, 94.9:5.1, 100.0:0.0, 97.0:3.0, 95.7:4.3, respectively. It is notable that the TiO2 fraction significantly increases with increasing Zn2+ doping content. According to the RRPFs, lattice parameters (a), theoretical densities (D xrd ), GOF and the quality of the refinement of all ceramic samples are determined and all of the results are listed in Table 1. The RRPFs of high quality for all ceramic samples are confirmed by the low values of goodness of fit (GOF) in a range of ~1.2–1.5 and those of the residual (R p, R exp and R wp) values in a range of ~7‒11%, where R p is the profile residual, R exp is the expected residual and R wp is the weighted profile residual, as seen in Table 1. In addition, the lattice parameter a values of all ceramic samples reveal no significant change with the increase of Zn2+ content due to the slightly different ionic radius of Cu2+ (0.87 Å) and Zn2+ (0.88 Å). Moreover, all lattice parameters (a) are comparable with that of the CCTO ceramics (a=7.391 Å) reported in literature [21,42]. Additionally, the theoretical densities (D xrd ) of undoped-CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics are lower than those of the Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics due to the replacement of a lighter Cu atom (63.546 amu) by a heavier Zn atom (65.380 amu).
Generally, dielectric and nonlinear characteristic of CCTO-based ceramics are significantly dependent on their microstructure [21,43]. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the microstructure evolutions of these CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 ceramics. Fig. 2(a)–(c) and (d)–(f) are SEM images of polished surface-ceramic samples sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h and 1100 °C for 5 h, respectively. The average grain sizes (AGs) of these samples were determined and summarized in Table 1. Obviously seen in Table 1 that, the AGs of all ceramic samples decrease with increasing Zn2+ doping content due to the solute drag mechanism [36,44] originate from the slight difference in ionic radii of Zn2+ (0.86 Å) dopant and Cu2+ (0.87 Å) host ions, including the existence of TiO2 phase. Furthermore, AGs of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics significantly increase with the sintering temperature, as obviously seen in Table 1. This behavior is similar to those observed in the microstructure of CCTO-based ceramics [21,23].
The frequency dependence of ε ′ and tanδ for Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are shown in Fig. 3(a) and inset (1) of Fig. 3(a), respectively. In Fig. 3(a), ε ′ values (at 30 °C and 1 kHz) of Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1 ceramics are found to be 130,566, 9200 and 4985, respectively. It is notable that ε ′ value of Ti01-1 ceramic decreases with increasing Zn2+ content. Interestingly, ε ′ values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are almost stable in the frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 MHz and further rapidly drop above 1 MHz, while that of Ti01-1 ceramic slightly decreases in the range of 100 Hz to 0.2 MHz and then rapidly drop above 0.2 MHz. The rapid drop of ε ′ in these ceramic samples is attributed to the Maxwell-Wagner relaxation model. According to this model, the dielectric relaxation is governed by the difference of electrical response of the grain and grain boundaries (GBs), which cause charge accumulation at the GBs [45,46]. In addition, it is found that ε ′ values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are approximately 14 and 26 times lower than that of the Ti01-1 ceramic. Nevertheless, these values are still large and sufficient for commercial applications. In addition to a high ε ′ value, tanδ value of a commercial dielectric material should be less than 0.05 [23]. As seen in the inset (1) of Fig. 3(a), at 30 °C and 1 kHz, tanδ values are found to be 0.09, 0.017 and 0.026 for Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1 ceramics, respectively. Surprisingly, it is found that tanδ values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are under the red dashed line (the red dashed line signifies tanδ=0.05) in a wide frequency range of 100–30,000 Hz and 100–10,000 Hz, respectively. Meanwhile, tanδ value of Ti01-1 ceramic is above this red dashed line with value higher than 0.05 for the whole range of frequency. Inset (2) of Fig. 3(a) displays a nonlinear J–E characteristic of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics. At 30 °C, α and E b value of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics were determined and found to be (4.51, 25.94, 49.66) and (599.45, 13146.25, 6626.06 V.cm−1), respectively. It is obvious that the lowest tanδ value of 0.017 observed in the Zn05-1 ceramic is consistent with the highest E b value. This might be due to the very high grain boundary resistance (R gb ), resulting from the TiO2-rich and Zn2+-doping effect. All values of ε ′, tanδ, α and E b of these ceramics are summarized in Table 2.
Fig. 3(b) and its inset (1) display the frequency dependence of ε ′ and tanδ of Ti01–2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics. At 30 °C and 1 kHz, ε ′ and tanδ value of Ti01–2, Zn05-2, Zn10-2 ceramics were determined and found to be (120,187, 26,558 and 14,574) and (0.090, 0.034 and 0.012), respectively. As seen in the inset (1) of Fig. 3(b), tanδ value of less than 0.05 for Zn10-2 ceramic is in a wide frequency range of 100–80000 Hz, while that of the Zn05-2 ceramic is in a narrow frequency range of 300–5000 Hz. It is notable that tanδ value of Ti01-2 ceramic is higher than 0.05 in the whole range of frequency measurement. Interestingly, tanδ values at 30 °C of Zn10-2 and Zn05-2 ceramics greatly decrease to approximately 7.5 and 3 times less than that of the Ti01-2 ceramic, whereas their ε ′ values are still perfectly high (higher than 1.2 × 104) enough for capacitor application. Interestingly, the lowest tanδ value is obtained in the Zn10-2 ceramic, which is suggested to originate from the highest R gb value (the highest potential barrier at grain boundary). As obviously seen in the inset (2) of Fig. 3(b), the highest E b value of 6029.65 V.cm−1 is obtained for the Zn10-2 ceramic with the lower values of 683.05 and 3070.25 V.cm−1 for Ti01–2 and Zn05-2 samples, respectively. In addition, α values were determined and found to be 5.63, 7.57 and 13.29 for the Ti01-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics, respectively. Interestingly, it is found that tanδ values at 30 °C of all Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics are lower and valid in a wider frequency range than those reported in literature for undoped and doped CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramics [15,21,24–28,30,31] with the comparable values to those reported in literature for capacitor materials sintered at high temperature [47–49]. According to their high performance of dielectric properties (high ε ′ and very low tanδ) of all Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics, they are suggested for X8R and X9R capacitor applications.
Remarkably, α and E b values of Ti01-1 and Ti01-2 ceramics can be improved by Zn2+ doping. The highest E b values in the Zn05-1 ceramic (~13146.25 V.cm−1) and the Zn10-2 ceramic (~6029.65 V.cm−1) correspond to the lowest tanδ values of them, as obviously seen in the inset (1) and (2) of Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. In addition, α values of Ti01-1 and Ti01–2 ceramics increase with increasing the Zn2+ doping content, as shown in Table 2. The highest α values obtained in Zn10-1 (α ~49.66) and Zn10-2 (α ~13.29) ceramics are comparable with those reported in literature [2,21,22,50] and the varistor material ZnO [51]. It is remarkable that the improvement of E b and α values might originate from an immense enhancement of R gb , resulting from the Zn2+ dopants and the existence of TiO2-rich phase.
In order to commercialize these ceramic samples for capacitor application, besides the high ε ′ and low tanδ, the Δε ′ value within a valid range of±15% is an important factor to be considered. Principally, this Δε ′ value is defined for X9R, X8R, X7R and X5R capacitors in a different temperature range (ΔT) of −55 to 200 °C, −55 to 150 °C, −55 to 125 °C and −55 to 85 °C, respectively [52]. As seen in Fig. 4(a) and (b) are the temperature dependence of Δε ′ for all ceramic samples determined at 30 °C and 1 kHz. From Fig. 4(a) and (b), the validity of temperature range (ΔT) for Δε ′ <±15% of all ceramic samples were determined and listed in Table 2. As seen in Table 2, Zn05-1, Zn10-2, Zn10-1 and Zn05-2 ceramics can be adequately applied for the EIA code X9R, X8R, X7R and X5R capacitors, respectively. Remarkably, a valid temperature range (Δε ′ <±15%) for X9R capacitor were rarely reported for CCTO-based compounds [2,4–6,9,15,17,19,36]. Thus, it is suggested that Zn2+-doped Ti01 ceramics is one of the most efficient materials, having appropriate dielectric properties for application in all kinds of capacitor including the X9R one. To our knowledge, this discovery has never been reported in literature for CCTO-based ceramics. Fig. 4(c) and (d) display the temperature dependence of ε ′ in a range of −60 to 210 °C for all ceramic samples. It is clearly seen in Fig. 4(c) and (d) that ε ′ of undoped Ti01 (Ti01-1 and Ti01-2) ceramics slightly increase with increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the Zn2+-doped Ti01 (Zn05-1 and Zn10-2) ceramics are independent on the temperature in the range of −60 to 210 °C. It is also found that temperature dependence of ε ′ for undoped Ti01 ceramics is similar to those observed in CCTO-based ceramics reported in literature [3,27]. Interestingly, Zn2+ doping in Ti01 ceramics contributes not only the temperature stability of ε ′, but also concurrently improve the temperature stability of tanδ. Fig. 4(e) and (f) display tanδ values at 1 kHz as a function of temperature for all ceramic samples. As seen in Fig. 4(e) and (f), tanδ values of both undoped Ti01 ceramics are higher than 0.05 when temperature increases above −30 °C, while those of the Zn05-1, Zn10-1, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics occur above 150 °C, 70 °C, 50 °C and 110 °C, respectively. Surprisingly, tanδ values of the Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics are less than 0.05 over the ΔT of −60 to 150 °C and −60 to 110 °C, respectively. This behavior of tanδ values in a wide temperature range has never been formerly reported in CCTO-based compounds [1,2,5,15] and other related materials [10,11,18]. The ΔT of Δε ′ <±15% and tanδ < 0.05 for all ceramic samples are listed in Table 2. Notably, very high ε ′ and very low tanδ values with the excellent temperature stability of ε ′ in Zn-doped Ti01 ceramics can be accomplished by optimization the concentration of Zn2+ dopant and appropriate sintering conditions. Remarkably, very high performance dielectric properties of Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics are infrequent to achieve in pure, doped, and co-doped CCTO based ceramics.
In order to investigate the distribution of Ca, Cu, Ti, and O elements in high performance dielectric Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics, mappings of these elements in both ceramics were performed using EDXS technique. EDXS results (not show) confirm the existence of Ca: Cu: Ti: O element in both grain (point 1) and grain boundary (point 2), as shown in Fig. 2(f) for Zn10-2 ceramic. However, EDXS peak of Zn metal cannot be observed in both GBs and grain, due to the low concentration of Zn2+ ions and the low resolution limit of the instrument and/or the existence of them as a liquid film at the GB, which is difficult to detect. Obviously seen in Fig. 5(a) and (b), the Ca, Cu, Ti, and O mapping images intensely confirm the existence of Ca, Cu, Ti, and O elements. As illustrated in Fig. 5(a) and (b), TiO2-rich phase (green lines) is observed along the GBs regions in both Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics. Furthermore, CaTiO3 secondary phase can be detected at the GBs in Zn10-2 ceramic. Obviously, only Ca, Ti and O elemental mapping are observed in the yellow dash circle in Fig. 5(b).
To further understand the diversity in the values of ε ′ and tanδ for all ceramic samples, the grain and grain boundary resistance (R g and R gb ) are investigated and discussed. In principle, R g and R gb of CCTO-based compounds are determined by the semicircular arc at high- and low-frequency range of impedance complex plane (Z*) plot, respectively [1,2,6,9,22,29,53]. In some case, Z* plot shows only the semicircular arc for the determination of R gb value and the R g value is determined from the nonzero intercept on the Z ′ axis [1]. Fig. 6(a) shows the frequency dependence of -Z″ of the Zn10-1 ceramic in the temperature range of 130–200 °C. As seen in Fig. 6(a), the peak height decreases with increasing temperature. In addition, the relaxation peaks occur at a low frequency range when the temperature decreases. As illustrated in Fig. 6(b), the peak height of ceramic samples sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h increases with increasing Zn2+ doping content to x=0.05 (Zn05-1 ceramic), and further decreases for x=0.10 (Zn10-1 ceramic). Obviously, both peaks shift to a lower frequency. Similarly, the peak height of ceramic samples sintered at 1100 °C for 5 h (Fig. 6(c)) is approximate the same for x=0.05 with the shift of peak to a higher frequency. Differently, the highest peak is observed for Zn10-2 ceramic with the shift of peak to a lower frequency. In general, R gb can be calculated by using the relationship R gb=2Z″max, where Z″max is the maximum peak height. As seen in Fig. 6(b) and (c), at 190 °C, R gb values of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are found to be 453, 413,190 and 18,951 Ω.cm, respectively. Meanwhile, those of Ti01–2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics are 1272, 1074 and 60,693 Ω.cm, respectively. Notably, these R gb values are consistent with the peak height (Z″max) and the low tanδ value of each ceramic. Moreover, the maximum R gb values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics correspond to the lowest tanδ values of them, as seen in the insets (1) of Fig. 4(e) and (f). This behavior is similar to those observed in other CCTO-based ceramics reported in literature [54–60]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the very high performance dielectric (high ε ′ and low tanδ) can be achieved in Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics, resulting from the high R gb value of each sample.
As revealed in Fig. 6(d) and its inset are the temperature dependence of grain boundary conductivity (σ gb, defined as σ gb=1/R gb) for ceramic samples sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h and those sintered at 1100 °C for 5 h, respectively. σ gb can be calculated by using Eq. (1), (1) ln σ g b=( − E g b k B T ) + ln σ 0 where σ0 is the pre-exponential term, k B and T are the Boltzmann constant and the absolute temperature, E gb is the activation energy for conduction at grain boundaries. By using Eq. (1) and slope of each ceramic sample (as seen in Fig. 6(d) and its inset), E gb values of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics were calculated and found to be 0.603, 0.636 and 0.614 eV, respectively. For Ti01–2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics, E gb are evaluated to be 0.636, 0.619 and 0.642 eV, respectively. These E gb values are comparable with those values previously reported for CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramics (E gb ~ 0.47–0.74 eV) [5,7,21,60], Ln 3+ -doped CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramics (E gb ~ 0.55–0.76 eV) [4,36] and co-doped CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramics (E gb ~ 0.61–0.81 eV) [17,19,61]. Remarkably, the highest E gb values are observed in Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics, corresponding to the lowest tanδ values of both ceramics. The values of E gb for all ceramics are listed in Table 2. It is notable that the E gb values of Zn2+-doped Ti01 ceramics significantly increase with increasing Zn2+ doping content, suggesting the decrease of oxygen vacancy at grain boundary. Generally, substitution of Zn2+ ions at the Cu2+ site does not generate free electron. Thus, the decrease of oxygen vacancy in these Zn2+-doped Ti01 ceramic might be related with the concentration of the single- and double-ionized oxygen vacancy [62], as expressed by Eqs. (2)–(5). In general, under the sintering process, oxygen vacancies can be generated by the release of oxygen from the crystal structure (Eq. (2)). (2) O 0 ⇔ 1 2 O 2 + V 0 (3) V 0 ⇔ e ′ + V 0 ′ (4) V 0 ′ ′ ⇔ e ′ + V 0 ′ (5) T i 3 + ⇔ e ′ + T i 4 + where e′ is the captured or released electron, V 0 is the loss of oxygen vacancy, V 0 ′ ′ and V 0 ′ are the double- and single-ionized oxygen vacancy, respectively. According to Eq. (5), electron ionized from oxygen vacancy can be trapped at Ti4+ site leading to the reduction of Ti3+. However, with increasing Zn2+ doping content, Ti3+ ions are not observed to increase due to their small amount compare to Ti4+ ions arisen from the TiO2 phase (as shown by the XRD results).
In order to verify the oxidation state of Ti ions in all ceramic samples, XANES measurements were performed. As shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b) are the normalized Ti K-edge XANES spectra of Ti2O3 (Ti3+) and TiO2 (Ti4+) standards with those of ceramic samples sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h and 1100 °C for 5 h, respectively. In Fig. 7(a) and (b), it is observed that the energy edge positions of Ti2O3 and TiO2 standards appear at approximately 4977.00 and 4979.60 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, those of the Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1, Ti01-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics appear at approximately 4979.48, 4979.50, 4979.56, 4979.49, 4979.55 and 4979.56 eV, respectively. It is obviously seen that the energy edge positions of these ceramic samples are close to the value 4979.76 eV of the standard TiO2, indicating the oxidation state of +4 for Ti ions in all of these samples. However, the slight change in energy edge positions of these ceramic samples can be observed, indicating the existence of Ti3+ ions. According to our previous work [36], the percentage ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ ions for these ceramic samples sintered at different conditions were calculated and found to decrease with increasing Zn2+ doping content. These results indicate the n-type semiconducting grain of these ceramic samples, occurring by the electron hopping between Ti3+ and Ti4+ ions. Therefore, it is suggested that the promotion of oxygen vacancies is influenced by Zn2+ doping content. The calculated percentage ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ ions for all ceramic samples are summarized in Table 2.

Conclusion:
The dielectric properties of CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics can be successfully improved by doping with Zn2+ ions. The decrease in grain sizes and the existence of TiO2 at grain boundary due to the Zn2+ doping are suggested to be the important factors in the reduction of tanδ value. Very high performance dielectric properties of giant dielectric constants (ε ′~9200) and very low tanδ (~0.017) at 1 kHz with the perfect temperature coefficient (Δε ′) less than±15% in a wide temperature range of −60 °C to 210 °C are successfully accomplished in the CaCu2.95Zn0.05Ti4.1O12 ceramic sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h. It is suggested that this ceramic has a potential to be applied for the EIA code X8R and X9R capacitors. Moreover, the excellent nonlinear properties with α ~ 25.94 and E b ~ 13146.25 V.cm−1 are obtained in this ceramic as well. The improvement of dielectric properties and nonlinear J–E characteristics are suggested to originate from the immense increase in R gb value, resulting from the Zn2+ ions doping and the appropriate sintering conditions.

Body:
So far, investigation on the improvement of dielectric and electrical properties with the temperature stability of dielectric constant (Δε ′=100 ×(ε ′ T-ε ′ 30 °C)/ ε ′ 30 °C) of the CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) [1–9] and related compounds [10–12] have been continuously studied and become even more attractive issue for researchers. Although these dielectric materials have been extensively investigated, however it was infrequently successful to achieve all requirements of very high dielectric performance in a wide temperature and frequency range, especially for the X8R and X9R capacitors. In general, the EIA code X8R and X9R capacitors are operated at a temperature higher than 125 °C without external cooling, which is a requirement for aerospace, military mobile communications and energy production industries [13]. In addition, it is specific that the condition of Δε ′ to satisfy for X8R and X9R capacitors should be less than±15% in a temperature range of −55 to 150 °C and −55 to 200 °C, respectively. Accordingly, investigation for X8R capacitors has been extensively studied and there are only a few articles that reported for CCTO-based compound [2,14,15]. However, there are no reports for X9R capacitor based on CCTO ceramic materials. Generally, X9R capacitors have been intensively studied and reported in ferroelectric perovskite compounds [13,16], normally sintered at high temperature, which is a disadvantage of the preparation process due to high energy consumption and might probably cause a seriously environmental problem. In order to improve the dielectric and electrical properties with a novel satisfy condition for Δε ′ of CCTO-based compound to meet the X8R and X9R capacitors, many approaches have been proposed for the preparation of the materials such as (1) doping and co-doping with various metals in CCTO ceramics to improve the electrical properties of grain boundaries (GBs) [2,17–19], (2) doping with some metals in CCTO/CaTiO3 composites [15,20], (3) using appropriate sintering conditions to enhance GB layers [21–23] and (4) increasing the Ti molar concentration in CCTO compound to produce TiO2-rich CCTO ceramics [24–27], Among these approaches, (1), (2) and (3) are the most ones that have been intensively reported [15,17–19,28,29] with a few of them that can successfully achieve for X8R capacitors such as the studies on Mg2+ doped CCTO/CaTiO3 [15], La3+ doped CCTO [8] and Zn-doping CCTO [2]. Furthermore, the study by approach (4) reported only the dielectric properties at room temperature without the study of Δε ′. For instance, Lin and coworkers [25] reported the effect of TiO2-rich in the microstructure and dielectric properties of CCTO (CaCu3Ti4+xO12; x=0.00–1.5) ceramics prepared by solid state reaction method. They found that TiO2 impurity phase trended to increase with increasing Ti content, resulting in the decrease of ε ′ and tanδ values to ~4233 and ~0.03, respectively. In addition to this, the nonlinear J–E properties could be improved as well. Ouyang and coworkers [24] reported the dielectric properties (ε ′ ~5.5 ×104 and tanδ ~0.2) of TiO2-rich CCTO ceramics derived by a sol gel method. Hao and coworkers [30] reported the preparation of CCTO/xTiO2 (x=0.0–2.0) ceramics by using a sol gel technique and found that the tanδ and ε ′ values decreased with increasing Ti content, due to the presence of TiO2 secondary phase. Other than this, it was also found that the CCTO/TiO2 composite ceramics had an advantage over the ferroelectric perovskite materials, because it could be prepared by a one-step process from a nominal CaCu3Ti4+xO12 composition [24,25] with sintering temperature lower than that of ferroelectric perovskite compounds. Consequently, it will be superior that the dielectric properties, nonlinear characteristics and Δε ′ of the CCTO/TiO2 ceramics can be concurrently improved with a novel innovation that might support the capacitors technology. Recently, it was also found that Zn2+ doping in CCTO-based ceramics [2,31–34] and co-doping with others metal [19,35] could improve not only the electrical properties, but also simultaneously enhance the Δε ′. For instance, high performance dielectric properties with the satisfy Δε ′ for X8R capacitor could be achieved in the Zn2+ ions doped CaCu2Ti4O12 ceramics [2]. According to this report and literature, it is supposed that Zn2+-doped CaCu2Ti4O12/TiO2 ceramics could simultaneously improve the dielectric properties with the satisfy Δε ′ for the X8R and X9R capacitors.

In this work, CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 (x=0.00, 0.05 and 0.10) precursor powders were prepared by the polymer pyrolysis (PP) solution method [9,20]. Effect of Zn2+ doping on the dielectric properties, nonlinear (J–E curve) characteristics and Δε ′ of all ceramic samples prepared from these precursor powders were studied and discussed based on the promotion of oxygen vacancy at grain boundary (GB). Interestingly, excellent dielectric properties (ε ′ ~9200 and tanδ ~0.017) with a wide valid temperature range (ΔT) of −60 to 210 °C for Δε′ ≤±15% and −60 to 150 °C for tanδ ≤ 0.05 were achieved. Moreover, the highest value of α (~49.66) and E b (~13146.25 V.cm−1) were obtained in this study. In order to elucidate the effect of Zn2+ ions on the dielectric properties and nonlinear characteristics of all prepared ceramic samples, impedance spectroscopy were performed.

CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 (x=0.00, 0.05 and 0.10, abbreviated as Ti01, Zn05 and Zn10, respectively) powders were prepared by the PP method. Acrylic acid (CH2=CHCOOH, Sigma Aldrich), Ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O4), Calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O), Zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), Copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) and Titanium solution (C16H28O6Ti 75 wt% in isopropanol) were employed as starting materials. The complete details of the PP method were described in our previous work [9]. The pellets of Ti01, Zn05 and Zn10 samples with approximate thickness of 1 mm and diameter of 9 mm were prepared by using the uniaxial compression at ~50 MPa. These pellet samples were sintered in air at two different sintering conditions of 1060 °C for 8 h (abbreviated as Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics) and 1100 °C for 5 h (abbreviated as Ti01-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics).

Microstructure and elemental mapping of ceramic samples were explored by scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6510LV, Oxford Instrument) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDXS). Standard line intercept technique was used to calculate the average grain sizes (AGs) of ceramic samples. Phase compositions were investigated by X-ray diffraction (Bruker/D8 Advance; Bruker BioSpin AG; λ=0.15406 nm). Prior to measurements of dielectric properties and nonlinear J–E curves, all ceramic pellets were polished and cleaned on both sides to obtain the smooth surfaces. Subsequently, both surfaces were coated with Au using a sputtering unit (Polaron SC500). Dielectric properties were measured in a wide temperature (−60 to 210 °C) and frequency (100 Hz to 1 MHz) ranges using an impedance gain phase analyzer (Hewlett Packard 4194A). Nonlinear J–E curves were examined at 30 °C using a high voltage measurement unit (Keithley Model 247). Two important values of nonlinear characteristics i.e. breakdown electric field (E b ) and nonlinear coefficient (α) were determined by a method described in our previous work [21,36]. The oxidation state of Ti ion in ceramic samples were verified using X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, Multiple X-ray, Energy 4–18 keV, Current 100 mA, 107–1010 photon s−1). The percentage of Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio in all ceramic samples was calculated using equation provided in our previous work [36]. The complete details of XANES technique and data analysis were described elsewhere [37,38].

Fig. 1(a)–(f) display the Rietveld refinement profile fits (RRPFs) [39] of the XRD patterns of all ceramic samples, which can be identified to correspond with the standard data for CaCu3Ti4O12 (ICSD card No.95714), having the body center cubic (bcc) structure. As expected, a minor peak of TiO2 phase (ICSD card No. 26715) is observed in the XRD patterns of all Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics with no detection of ZnO impurity phase due to the insensitivity of the XRD technique to any phase of concentration less than 0.5 wt% [40,41]. According to the RRPFs, the CaCu3Ti4O12:TiO2 ratios of Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1, T101-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics were determined and found to be 100.0:0.0, 97.9:2.1, 94.9:5.1, 100.0:0.0, 97.0:3.0, 95.7:4.3, respectively. It is notable that the TiO2 fraction significantly increases with increasing Zn2+ doping content. According to the RRPFs, lattice parameters (a), theoretical densities (D xrd ), GOF and the quality of the refinement of all ceramic samples are determined and all of the results are listed in Table 1. The RRPFs of high quality for all ceramic samples are confirmed by the low values of goodness of fit (GOF) in a range of ~1.2–1.5 and those of the residual (R p, R exp and R wp) values in a range of ~7‒11%, where R p is the profile residual, R exp is the expected residual and R wp is the weighted profile residual, as seen in Table 1. In addition, the lattice parameter a values of all ceramic samples reveal no significant change with the increase of Zn2+ content due to the slightly different ionic radius of Cu2+ (0.87 Å) and Zn2+ (0.88 Å). Moreover, all lattice parameters (a) are comparable with that of the CCTO ceramics (a=7.391 Å) reported in literature [21,42]. Additionally, the theoretical densities (D xrd ) of undoped-CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics are lower than those of the Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics due to the replacement of a lighter Cu atom (63.546 amu) by a heavier Zn atom (65.380 amu).

Generally, dielectric and nonlinear characteristic of CCTO-based ceramics are significantly dependent on their microstructure [21,43]. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the microstructure evolutions of these CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 ceramics. Fig. 2(a)–(c) and (d)–(f) are SEM images of polished surface-ceramic samples sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h and 1100 °C for 5 h, respectively. The average grain sizes (AGs) of these samples were determined and summarized in Table 1. Obviously seen in Table 1 that, the AGs of all ceramic samples decrease with increasing Zn2+ doping content due to the solute drag mechanism [36,44] originate from the slight difference in ionic radii of Zn2+ (0.86 Å) dopant and Cu2+ (0.87 Å) host ions, including the existence of TiO2 phase. Furthermore, AGs of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics significantly increase with the sintering temperature, as obviously seen in Table 1. This behavior is similar to those observed in the microstructure of CCTO-based ceramics [21,23].

The frequency dependence of ε ′ and tanδ for Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are shown in Fig. 3(a) and inset (1) of Fig. 3(a), respectively. In Fig. 3(a), ε ′ values (at 30 °C and 1 kHz) of Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1 ceramics are found to be 130,566, 9200 and 4985, respectively. It is notable that ε ′ value of Ti01-1 ceramic decreases with increasing Zn2+ content. Interestingly, ε ′ values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are almost stable in the frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 MHz and further rapidly drop above 1 MHz, while that of Ti01-1 ceramic slightly decreases in the range of 100 Hz to 0.2 MHz and then rapidly drop above 0.2 MHz. The rapid drop of ε ′ in these ceramic samples is attributed to the Maxwell-Wagner relaxation model. According to this model, the dielectric relaxation is governed by the difference of electrical response of the grain and grain boundaries (GBs), which cause charge accumulation at the GBs [45,46]. In addition, it is found that ε ′ values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are approximately 14 and 26 times lower than that of the Ti01-1 ceramic. Nevertheless, these values are still large and sufficient for commercial applications. In addition to a high ε ′ value, tanδ value of a commercial dielectric material should be less than 0.05 [23]. As seen in the inset (1) of Fig. 3(a), at 30 °C and 1 kHz, tanδ values are found to be 0.09, 0.017 and 0.026 for Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1 ceramics, respectively. Surprisingly, it is found that tanδ values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are under the red dashed line (the red dashed line signifies tanδ=0.05) in a wide frequency range of 100–30,000 Hz and 100–10,000 Hz, respectively. Meanwhile, tanδ value of Ti01-1 ceramic is above this red dashed line with value higher than 0.05 for the whole range of frequency. Inset (2) of Fig. 3(a) displays a nonlinear J–E characteristic of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics. At 30 °C, α and E b value of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics were determined and found to be (4.51, 25.94, 49.66) and (599.45, 13146.25, 6626.06 V.cm−1), respectively. It is obvious that the lowest tanδ value of 0.017 observed in the Zn05-1 ceramic is consistent with the highest E b value. This might be due to the very high grain boundary resistance (R gb ), resulting from the TiO2-rich and Zn2+-doping effect. All values of ε ′, tanδ, α and E b of these ceramics are summarized in Table 2.

Fig. 3(b) and its inset (1) display the frequency dependence of ε ′ and tanδ of Ti01–2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics. At 30 °C and 1 kHz, ε ′ and tanδ value of Ti01–2, Zn05-2, Zn10-2 ceramics were determined and found to be (120,187, 26,558 and 14,574) and (0.090, 0.034 and 0.012), respectively. As seen in the inset (1) of Fig. 3(b), tanδ value of less than 0.05 for Zn10-2 ceramic is in a wide frequency range of 100–80000 Hz, while that of the Zn05-2 ceramic is in a narrow frequency range of 300–5000 Hz. It is notable that tanδ value of Ti01-2 ceramic is higher than 0.05 in the whole range of frequency measurement. Interestingly, tanδ values at 30 °C of Zn10-2 and Zn05-2 ceramics greatly decrease to approximately 7.5 and 3 times less than that of the Ti01-2 ceramic, whereas their ε ′ values are still perfectly high (higher than 1.2 × 104) enough for capacitor application. Interestingly, the lowest tanδ value is obtained in the Zn10-2 ceramic, which is suggested to originate from the highest R gb value (the highest potential barrier at grain boundary). As obviously seen in the inset (2) of Fig. 3(b), the highest E b value of 6029.65 V.cm−1 is obtained for the Zn10-2 ceramic with the lower values of 683.05 and 3070.25 V.cm−1 for Ti01–2 and Zn05-2 samples, respectively. In addition, α values were determined and found to be 5.63, 7.57 and 13.29 for the Ti01-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics, respectively. Interestingly, it is found that tanδ values at 30 °C of all Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics are lower and valid in a wider frequency range than those reported in literature for undoped and doped CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramics [15,21,24–28,30,31] with the comparable values to those reported in literature for capacitor materials sintered at high temperature [47–49]. According to their high performance of dielectric properties (high ε ′ and very low tanδ) of all Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics, they are suggested for X8R and X9R capacitor applications.

Remarkably, α and E b values of Ti01-1 and Ti01-2 ceramics can be improved by Zn2+ doping. The highest E b values in the Zn05-1 ceramic (~13146.25 V.cm−1) and the Zn10-2 ceramic (~6029.65 V.cm−1) correspond to the lowest tanδ values of them, as obviously seen in the inset (1) and (2) of Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. In addition, α values of Ti01-1 and Ti01–2 ceramics increase with increasing the Zn2+ doping content, as shown in Table 2. The highest α values obtained in Zn10-1 (α ~49.66) and Zn10-2 (α ~13.29) ceramics are comparable with those reported in literature [2,21,22,50] and the varistor material ZnO [51]. It is remarkable that the improvement of E b and α values might originate from an immense enhancement of R gb , resulting from the Zn2+ dopants and the existence of TiO2-rich phase.

In order to commercialize these ceramic samples for capacitor application, besides the high ε ′ and low tanδ, the Δε ′ value within a valid range of±15% is an important factor to be considered. Principally, this Δε ′ value is defined for X9R, X8R, X7R and X5R capacitors in a different temperature range (ΔT) of −55 to 200 °C, −55 to 150 °C, −55 to 125 °C and −55 to 85 °C, respectively [52]. As seen in Fig. 4(a) and (b) are the temperature dependence of Δε ′ for all ceramic samples determined at 30 °C and 1 kHz. From Fig. 4(a) and (b), the validity of temperature range (ΔT) for Δε ′ <±15% of all ceramic samples were determined and listed in Table 2. As seen in Table 2, Zn05-1, Zn10-2, Zn10-1 and Zn05-2 ceramics can be adequately applied for the EIA code X9R, X8R, X7R and X5R capacitors, respectively. Remarkably, a valid temperature range (Δε ′ <±15%) for X9R capacitor were rarely reported for CCTO-based compounds [2,4–6,9,15,17,19,36]. Thus, it is suggested that Zn2+-doped Ti01 ceramics is one of the most efficient materials, having appropriate dielectric properties for application in all kinds of capacitor including the X9R one. To our knowledge, this discovery has never been reported in literature for CCTO-based ceramics. Fig. 4(c) and (d) display the temperature dependence of ε ′ in a range of −60 to 210 °C for all ceramic samples. It is clearly seen in Fig. 4(c) and (d) that ε ′ of undoped Ti01 (Ti01-1 and Ti01-2) ceramics slightly increase with increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the Zn2+-doped Ti01 (Zn05-1 and Zn10-2) ceramics are independent on the temperature in the range of −60 to 210 °C. It is also found that temperature dependence of ε ′ for undoped Ti01 ceramics is similar to those observed in CCTO-based ceramics reported in literature [3,27]. Interestingly, Zn2+ doping in Ti01 ceramics contributes not only the temperature stability of ε ′, but also concurrently improve the temperature stability of tanδ. Fig. 4(e) and (f) display tanδ values at 1 kHz as a function of temperature for all ceramic samples. As seen in Fig. 4(e) and (f), tanδ values of both undoped Ti01 ceramics are higher than 0.05 when temperature increases above −30 °C, while those of the Zn05-1, Zn10-1, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics occur above 150 °C, 70 °C, 50 °C and 110 °C, respectively. Surprisingly, tanδ values of the Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics are less than 0.05 over the ΔT of −60 to 150 °C and −60 to 110 °C, respectively. This behavior of tanδ values in a wide temperature range has never been formerly reported in CCTO-based compounds [1,2,5,15] and other related materials [10,11,18]. The ΔT of Δε ′ <±15% and tanδ < 0.05 for all ceramic samples are listed in Table 2. Notably, very high ε ′ and very low tanδ values with the excellent temperature stability of ε ′ in Zn-doped Ti01 ceramics can be accomplished by optimization the concentration of Zn2+ dopant and appropriate sintering conditions. Remarkably, very high performance dielectric properties of Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics are infrequent to achieve in pure, doped, and co-doped CCTO based ceramics.

In order to investigate the distribution of Ca, Cu, Ti, and O elements in high performance dielectric Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics, mappings of these elements in both ceramics were performed using EDXS technique. EDXS results (not show) confirm the existence of Ca: Cu: Ti: O element in both grain (point 1) and grain boundary (point 2), as shown in Fig. 2(f) for Zn10-2 ceramic. However, EDXS peak of Zn metal cannot be observed in both GBs and grain, due to the low concentration of Zn2+ ions and the low resolution limit of the instrument and/or the existence of them as a liquid film at the GB, which is difficult to detect. Obviously seen in Fig. 5(a) and (b), the Ca, Cu, Ti, and O mapping images intensely confirm the existence of Ca, Cu, Ti, and O elements. As illustrated in Fig. 5(a) and (b), TiO2-rich phase (green lines) is observed along the GBs regions in both Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics. Furthermore, CaTiO3 secondary phase can be detected at the GBs in Zn10-2 ceramic. Obviously, only Ca, Ti and O elemental mapping are observed in the yellow dash circle in Fig. 5(b).

To further understand the diversity in the values of ε ′ and tanδ for all ceramic samples, the grain and grain boundary resistance (R g and R gb ) are investigated and discussed. In principle, R g and R gb of CCTO-based compounds are determined by the semicircular arc at high- and low-frequency range of impedance complex plane (Z*) plot, respectively [1,2,6,9,22,29,53]. In some case, Z* plot shows only the semicircular arc for the determination of R gb value and the R g value is determined from the nonzero intercept on the Z ′ axis [1]. Fig. 6(a) shows the frequency dependence of -Z″ of the Zn10-1 ceramic in the temperature range of 130–200 °C. As seen in Fig. 6(a), the peak height decreases with increasing temperature. In addition, the relaxation peaks occur at a low frequency range when the temperature decreases. As illustrated in Fig. 6(b), the peak height of ceramic samples sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h increases with increasing Zn2+ doping content to x=0.05 (Zn05-1 ceramic), and further decreases for x=0.10 (Zn10-1 ceramic). Obviously, both peaks shift to a lower frequency. Similarly, the peak height of ceramic samples sintered at 1100 °C for 5 h (Fig. 6(c)) is approximate the same for x=0.05 with the shift of peak to a higher frequency. Differently, the highest peak is observed for Zn10-2 ceramic with the shift of peak to a lower frequency. In general, R gb can be calculated by using the relationship R gb=2Z″max, where Z″max is the maximum peak height. As seen in Fig. 6(b) and (c), at 190 °C, R gb values of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are found to be 453, 413,190 and 18,951 Ω.cm, respectively. Meanwhile, those of Ti01–2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics are 1272, 1074 and 60,693 Ω.cm, respectively. Notably, these R gb values are consistent with the peak height (Z″max) and the low tanδ value of each ceramic. Moreover, the maximum R gb values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics correspond to the lowest tanδ values of them, as seen in the insets (1) of Fig. 4(e) and (f). This behavior is similar to those observed in other CCTO-based ceramics reported in literature [54–60]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the very high performance dielectric (high ε ′ and low tanδ) can be achieved in Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics, resulting from the high R gb value of each sample.

As revealed in Fig. 6(d) and its inset are the temperature dependence of grain boundary conductivity (σ gb, defined as σ gb=1/R gb) for ceramic samples sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h and those sintered at 1100 °C for 5 h, respectively. σ gb can be calculated by using Eq. (1), (1) ln σ g b=( − E g b k B T ) + ln σ 0 where σ0 is the pre-exponential term, k B and T are the Boltzmann constant and the absolute temperature, E gb is the activation energy for conduction at grain boundaries. By using Eq. (1) and slope of each ceramic sample (as seen in Fig. 6(d) and its inset), E gb values of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics were calculated and found to be 0.603, 0.636 and 0.614 eV, respectively. For Ti01–2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics, E gb are evaluated to be 0.636, 0.619 and 0.642 eV, respectively. These E gb values are comparable with those values previously reported for CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramics (E gb ~ 0.47–0.74 eV) [5,7,21,60], Ln 3+ -doped CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramics (E gb ~ 0.55–0.76 eV) [4,36] and co-doped CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramics (E gb ~ 0.61–0.81 eV) [17,19,61]. Remarkably, the highest E gb values are observed in Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics, corresponding to the lowest tanδ values of both ceramics. The values of E gb for all ceramics are listed in Table 2. It is notable that the E gb values of Zn2+-doped Ti01 ceramics significantly increase with increasing Zn2+ doping content, suggesting the decrease of oxygen vacancy at grain boundary. Generally, substitution of Zn2+ ions at the Cu2+ site does not generate free electron. Thus, the decrease of oxygen vacancy in these Zn2+-doped Ti01 ceramic might be related with the concentration of the single- and double-ionized oxygen vacancy [62], as expressed by Eqs. (2)–(5). In general, under the sintering process, oxygen vacancies can be generated by the release of oxygen from the crystal structure (Eq. (2)). (2) O 0 ⇔ 1 2 O 2 + V 0 (3) V 0 ⇔ e ′ + V 0 ′ (4) V 0 ′ ′ ⇔ e ′ + V 0 ′ (5) T i 3 + ⇔ e ′ + T i 4 + where e′ is the captured or released electron, V 0 is the loss of oxygen vacancy, V 0 ′ ′ and V 0 ′ are the double- and single-ionized oxygen vacancy, respectively. According to Eq. (5), electron ionized from oxygen vacancy can be trapped at Ti4+ site leading to the reduction of Ti3+. However, with increasing Zn2+ doping content, Ti3+ ions are not observed to increase due to their small amount compare to Ti4+ ions arisen from the TiO2 phase (as shown by the XRD results).

In order to verify the oxidation state of Ti ions in all ceramic samples, XANES measurements were performed. As shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b) are the normalized Ti K-edge XANES spectra of Ti2O3 (Ti3+) and TiO2 (Ti4+) standards with those of ceramic samples sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h and 1100 °C for 5 h, respectively. In Fig. 7(a) and (b), it is observed that the energy edge positions of Ti2O3 and TiO2 standards appear at approximately 4977.00 and 4979.60 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, those of the Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1, Ti01-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics appear at approximately 4979.48, 4979.50, 4979.56, 4979.49, 4979.55 and 4979.56 eV, respectively. It is obviously seen that the energy edge positions of these ceramic samples are close to the value 4979.76 eV of the standard TiO2, indicating the oxidation state of +4 for Ti ions in all of these samples. However, the slight change in energy edge positions of these ceramic samples can be observed, indicating the existence of Ti3+ ions. According to our previous work [36], the percentage ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ ions for these ceramic samples sintered at different conditions were calculated and found to decrease with increasing Zn2+ doping content. These results indicate the n-type semiconducting grain of these ceramic samples, occurring by the electron hopping between Ti3+ and Ti4+ ions. Therefore, it is suggested that the promotion of oxygen vacancies is influenced by Zn2+ doping content. The calculated percentage ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ ions for all ceramic samples are summarized in Table 2.

The dielectric properties of CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics can be successfully improved by doping with Zn2+ ions. The decrease in grain sizes and the existence of TiO2 at grain boundary due to the Zn2+ doping are suggested to be the important factors in the reduction of tanδ value. Very high performance dielectric properties of giant dielectric constants (ε ′~9200) and very low tanδ (~0.017) at 1 kHz with the perfect temperature coefficient (Δε ′) less than±15% in a wide temperature range of −60 °C to 210 °C are successfully accomplished in the CaCu2.95Zn0.05Ti4.1O12 ceramic sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h. It is suggested that this ceramic has a potential to be applied for the EIA code X8R and X9R capacitors. Moreover, the excellent nonlinear properties with α ~ 25.94 and E b ~ 13146.25 V.cm−1 are obtained in this ceramic as well. The improvement of dielectric properties and nonlinear J–E characteristics are suggested to originate from the immense increase in R gb value, resulting from the Zn2+ ions doping and the appropriate sintering conditions.

Title:
BaZnRu

Abstract:
Single crystals of the novel compound BaZnRu5O11 were grown from a barium chloride flux. The composition was determined from refinements of single crystal X-ray diffraction data and microprobe analysis. BaZnRu5O11 crystallizes in a supercell of the R-type ferrite structure with doubled a and b unit cell parameters (space group P63/m, Z=8, a=11.7411(2) Å, c=13.6842(4) Å). The reason for the superstructure is the formation of Ru–Ru pairs with short distances within the idealized kagome net extending in (001). No indication of Zn/Ru mixed occupied sites was observed. BaZnRu5O11 does not show any sign of magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K. A large negative Curie–Weiss temperature ΘW ⊥=−290 K (ΘW ||=−230 K) suggests strong Ru3+ (S=½) antiferromagnetic interactions frustrated on the kagome network of this compound. It is suggested that distortion of the well-ordered kagome sublattice gives rise to unusual behaviour of magnetic and electrical transport properties at low temperatures: BaZnRu5O11 single crystals exhibit a susceptibility χ∼1 − T and electrical resistivity ρ∼T 1.6 below about 10 K which may indicate a non-Fermi liquid.

Introduction:
Ruthenium oxides, one of the most interesting families of transition metal oxides, have been intensively investigated during the last decades due to their unusual physical properties. One of the most important features of 4d transition metal oxides is the large spatial extension of d electron orbitals. The 4d valence electrons of Ru are, therefore, expected to show weaker localization and should be more conducting than their 3d analogs. Furthermore, the extended d orbitals lead to significant d-p hybridization between the transition metal and oxygen, and enhance also crystalline-electric field effects. These features have shown to be responsible for the diversity of intriguing physical properties in ruthenium oxides (Ref. [1], and references therein).
Recently, we have succeeded in synthesizing ternary ruthenium ferrites with chemical formula (Ba,Sr) M 2±x R u 4 + − x O 11 (M=Fe, Co, Mn), which crystallize in the so-called R-type hexagonal structure [2–5]. The homogeneity range is generated by variable occupation of two octahedrally coordinated metal sites by 3d and 4d metals, while a trigonal-pyramidal (tetrahedrally) coordinated site is exclusively occupied by 3d metals (Fig. 1 ). Within (001) layers of edge-sharing octahedra (M,Ru)O6 are located, of which the central metal atoms form a kagome sublattice. An especially attractive characteristic of ternary ruthenium ferrites is that the magnetic and electrical properties of these materials can be widely varied by changing the ratio of the 3d/4d elements within the homogeneity range. It was found that some compositions of Fe-bearing ferrites exhibit a unique coexistence of narrow-gap semiconductivity with ferrimagnetic order below unusually high Curie temperatures TC∼490 K. The substitution of Fe2+/Fe3+ for Ru3+/Ru5+ appears to be vital for the control of the magnetic and transport properties, which makes R-type ferrites attractive for spintronic applications [3]. Furthermore, the consequent replacement of Fe2+/Fe3+ for Co2+ or for Cu2+ tunes the system from magnetic semiconductors to magnetic or even non-magnetic metals [3,6]. An interesting feature of the R-type ferrites family is that despite the magnetic frustration inherent for this structure, when canted antiferromagnetic order in Co or Mn analogous exists on the kagome planes, it is possible to produce a robust magnetic ground state with non-zero spin-chirality [6,7]. The presence of spin-chirality may play a crucial role in important phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity [8] and anomalous Hall effect [9–11]. Non-zero scalar chirality is known to drive locally a Hall current and leads to anomalous Hall effect of topological origin, which is independent of the conventional spin-orbit contribution and shows distinct low-temperature behavior. An abnormal Hall effect associated with the non-trivial spin configuration (non-zero scalar chirality) was observed in Co- and Mn-bearing ferrites [6,7].
In this paper we report the magnetic properties of single crystals BaZnRu5O11, which are closely related to crystal structure details. We also briefly compare the properties of BaZnRu5O11 to those of R-type Fe, Co or Mn ferrites investigated in our previous studies [3–5,7]. In contrast to the previously studied members of the R-type family no 3d/4d disorder is observed in BaZnRu5O11. The study of the fully ordered compound would be of great importance since the ordered structure appears to relieve the magnetic frustration within the distorted kagome planes extending in (001). Hence, the formation of different ground states within one structural family and the access to the quantum critical state becomes possible.

Experimental:
Single crystals of BaZnRu5O11 were grown in the form of black, hexagonal plates from BaCl2 flux, as described elsewhere [2]. Well shaped crystals were selected for single crystal X-ray diffraction data collection. The measurements were performed using a 4 circle diffractometer (NONIUS-κ-CCD, Bruker AXS GmbH) with monochromatic MoK α radiation. Selected information concerning the data collection and structure refinements are gathered in Tables 1–4 . Further details of the crystal structure investigations may be obtained from Fachinformationszentrum Karlsruhe, 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany (fax: +49-7247-808-666; e-mail: crysdata@fiz-karlsruhe.de, http://www.fiz-informationsienste.de/en/DB/icsd/depot_anforderung.html) on quoting the deposition number CSD-423536.
Chemical μ-probe analyses result in very consistent compositions observed for all crystals investigated, and the inferred atomic density ratios n(Ba)/n(Zn)/n(Ru)=0.98±1: 0.99±6: 5.01±6 (the oxygen content could not be quantified with this technique) are in excellent agreement with the composition BaZnRu5O11 obtained from the X-ray diffraction data refinements. No additional elements were detected.
The DC magnetization of oriented single crystals was measured over a temperature range 2K ≤ T ≤ 300 K in applied magnetic fields 0 ≤ μ o H ≤ 5 T using a Quantum Design MPMS7 Magnetometer. The electrical resistivity was measured by a standard dc-method in the temperature range 1K ≤ T ≤ 300 K.

Results And Discussion:
3.1 Crystal structure Fig. 1 shows the usual unit cell of R-type ferrite compounds, for BaZnRu5O11 with a=5.8706(2) Å and c=13.6842(6) Å (in centrosymmetric space group P63/mmc). The crystal structure consists of layers of edge-sharing octahedra RuO6 which are interconnected in [001] direction via face-sharing octahedra-doubles Ru2O9 and trigonal bipyramids ZnO5. The latter metal atom within trigonal bipyramids is actually located in one of the two constituting tetrahedra, but typically static or dynamically disordered over both positions depending on temperature. Ordered cases were also described (typical description in the noncentrosymmetric space group P63 mc). It is worth pointing out, that the Ru atoms within the planes of edge-sharing octahedra for this subcell are arranged in the motif of an ideal kagome net with distances d(Ru–Ru)=2.9353(4) Å. This completely ordered arrangement of Ru and Zn within the different coordination environments was earlier described for, e. g., BaCuRu5O11 [5] and no indication for a significant disorder like in (Ba,Sr) M 2±x R u 4 + − x O 11 (M=Fe, Co) could be found [2–4]. These crystal structure refinements are in excellent agreement with the results from chemical analysis via μ-probe resulting in atomic ratios of n(Ba)/n(Zn)/n(Ru) of 0.98±1: 0.99±6: 5.01±6. Taking additional weak superstructure reflections in the X-ray diffraction experiment into account a unit cell with a=11.7411(3) Å and c=13.6842(6) Å results. The reason for this superstructure lies mostly within the kagome nets, which distort because every two Ru atoms form pairs with short distances d(Ru–Ru) ≈ 2.632(1) Å, while the remaining interatomic separations within the plane are enlarged to about 3.0 Å. Fig. 2 gives an impression of the arrangement of the Ru–Ru pairs within the distorted kagome net. Similar pairing of d 5-Ru3+ ions is known from, e. g., β-RuCl3 [12]: In this crystal structure the Ru3+ ions are located in chains of face-sharing octahedra formed from Cl−. In the high-temperature form of RuCl3 above 206 K the Ru along the chain are arranged equidistant with d(Ru–Ru) ≈ 2.827 Å, in the low-temperature phase pair formation is observed with alternating distances of d(Ru–Ru) ≈ 2.633 Å and 3.001 Å. A similar, yet fundamentally different distortion of the kagome lattice of R-type ferrites has been observed, e. g., for the vanadates NaV6O11, SrV6O11 and PbV6O11 below 245 K, 320 K, and 560 K, respectively [13]. A more detailed structure discussion is given in another paper on isostructural compounds with the same type of distortion within the kagome plane [14]. It was indicated, that in units built from two face-sharing octahedra Ru2O9 the Ru–Ru distance is an indicative of the oxidation state of Ru, since the higher the oxidation state the larger the repulsion. The observed separations d(Ru–Ru)=2.653(2) Å/2.750(3) Å are in the expected range for Ru+4.5 and Ru+5 compared to data taken from a large number of fully ordered 6H-perovskite ruthenates [15,16]. Provided +2 for Ba and Zn and –2 for O charge balance leads to +3 for Ru within the kagome planes and in turn +4.5 for Ru in face-sharing octahedra as likely assignments for oxidation states.
3.2 Magnetic properties The magnetic lattice of BaZnRu5O11 consists of 4d 5 Ru3+ (S=½) ions forming a distorted kagome lattice within the (001) plane, which is separated from the adjacent kagome layers by non-magnetic Zn2+ and doubles of ruthenium, with mixed Ru(IV)/Ru(V) valency according to crystal structure arguments (see above). Fig. 3 shows data for the magnetic susceptibility χ=M/H for a BaZnRu5O11 single crystal oriented perpendicular to the c-axis in an applied field of μH=1 T. We did not find any evidence of magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K. A similar behavior of the magnetic susceptibility is observed when magnetic field is applied parallel to the c-axis (Fig. 4 ). As shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the inverse field-cooled (FC) dc-susceptibility (H⊥c) presents a change in slope above 50 K and a linear behavior above 100 K. A Curie–Weiss fit of the data in the temperature interval 100 < T < 300 K gives a Curie–Weiss temperature Θ W⊥=−290 K and an effective magnetic moment of 2.37 μ B/Ru, which is noticeably lower than the theoretical spin-only value of 3.87 μ B for Ru5+ (S=3/2), and only slightly reduced compared to the spin-only value of μeff=2.83 μB expected for Ru4+ (S=1). A deviation in the experimental value of the effective magnetic moment from the theoretical one expected for Ru5+ or Ru4+ could be attributed to strong hybridization between the Ru 4d and O 2p electronic states, which often leads to the loss of the local magnetic moment in ruthenium oxides [1] and to direct Ru–Ru bonding interactions. The susceptibility of single crystals BaZnRu5O11 is anisotropic and is about two times lower for H∥c. Above 100 K χ∥ follows a Curie–Weiss law with Θ W∥=−230 K, and μ eff=1.78 μ B/Ru (inset in Fig. 3). This value is very close to the theoretical spin-only value of μ eff=1.73 μ B expected for trivalent low-spin Ru3+ (S=½) in octahedral coordination. The observed difference in effective magnetic moment for two crystallographic directions could be related to the different valence states of Ru within and between the kagome layers. The large negative Curie–Weiss temperature is consistent with the dominance of antiferromagnetic Ru–Ru interactions in the magnetic exchange within and between kagome layers. Therefore, in contrast to the strong ferrimagnets (Ba,Sr) M 2±x R u 4 + − x O 11 (M=Fe, Co, Mn) [4,6,7], the Zn analogue does not display long-range magnetic order down to 1.8 K. This result points to the presence of much stronger geometrical frustrations in the Zn-bearing compound due to the lack of disorder on the Ru sites of the kagome planes. The magnetization curves of BaZnRu5O11 are qualitatively the same for both field orientations, i. e., the isothermal magnetization increases with magnetic field in a linear manner without saturation at the maximum applied field of 5 T, showing a weak anisotropy (Fig. 5 ). This behavior is typical of weak magnetic materials. We focus now our attention on the low-temperature region of the magnetic susceptibility. The low-temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of BaZnRu5O11 single crystals under a magnetic field of H=1 T applied perpendicular or parallel to the c-axis is presented in Fig. 6 . The main result is that the susceptibility below 6 K deviates from the Curie law, exhibiting a non-analytic temperature dependence of the form χ(T)∼1– T . The magnetic susceptibility of the sample can be fitted with the following expression: (1) χ=a − b T , where a=8.02 × 10−3 (3.44 × 10−3) emu/mol, and b=1.77 × 10−3 (4.2 × 10−4) emu/mol are the best fitting coefficients for H⊥c (H∥c). The square-root form of the low-temperature behavior of the bulk properties may indicate a non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior, which is frequently observed near low-temperature quantum critical point between paramagnetic and magnetically ordered states in metals with heavy quasiparticles [17]. Therefore, the low-temperature divergence of the magnetic susceptibility suggests the existence of unusual magnetic excitations, whose properties are distinct of those familiar Fermi-liquids. In current NFL theories developed for heavy fermion intermetallics [18], the role of geometrical frustration in the formation of NFL state near quantum criticality has not received much attention. However, there are indications that the geometrical frustration plays an important role in the development of quantum critical state in a number of metallic magnets based on frustrated lattices [19–22]. This issue remains unsettled and calls for systematic theoretical and experimental studies on a diverse set of novel metallic magnets based on geometrically frustrated lattices. BaZnRu5O11 seems to be a novel candidate for testing the influence of geometrical frustration on low-temperature properties of metallic magnets. It is instructive to view BaZnRu5O11 as an ordered version of R-type ferrites with strong magnetic frustrations inherent to the kagome planes located in (001) of this structure. In the isostructural Co-bearing (T c=105 K) metallic ferrite there is a 3d/4d disorder on the kagome net forming sites [4]. Consequently, the magnetic frustrations are reduced and long-range ferro-(ferri)-magnetic ordering occurs at relatively high temperatures. Upon substitution of Co with Zn the structural disorder in the kagome planes disappears. Furthermore, in the Zn-bearing compound, the electrons become more itinerant than in the Co-containing phase, most probably due to an increased number of 3d electrons and reduction of disorder in the system. Therefore, the magnetic frustrations in the kagome network cannot be removed, and no magnetic ordering is observed in BaZnRu5O11. However, Ru spins may still have the tendency to be ordered at very low temperatures due to distortion of the kagome lattice of BaZnRu5O11 as evidenced from the crystal structure refinement. In this situation the competition between the geometrical frustration and local coupling of Ru3+ spins on distorted kagome lattice may play an essential role in the precise nature of the ground state of BaZnRu5O11. The frustration due to lattice geometry in Ru3+ (S=1/2) triangular lattice antiferromagnet would result in infinite ground-state degeneracy with no long-range order at any temperature, however, in the presence of lattice distortion the residual interactions between the Ru spins tend to order the system magnetically. If these two processes are about equal in strength, than the system would be lying in the vicinity of a quantum critical point.
3.3 Electrical resistivity The temperature dependences of the in-plane resistivity ρ(T) of the BaZnRu5O11 single crystal is shown in Fig. 7 . The positive slope dρ/dT gt; 0 and small variation of the resistivity from 5.1 to 3.4 mΩ cm as the temperature falls from 300 to 1 K allow to classify this material as a semimetal. Moreover, the basal-plane electrical resistance of our single crystal BaZnRu5O11 is ρ300 K about 5 mΩ cm, which is more than three orders of magnitude lower compared to semiconducting (Ba,Sr) F e 2±x R u 4 + − x O 11 analogues, and in the range of the typical metal BaCo1.8Ru4.2O11 [4]. It is particularly noteworthy that complete replacement of Ru (thought to be mixed valent 3+/5+ [2]) by Ti4+ yields a wide-gapped insulator [6,23], while partial replacement of Ru by Co2+/Co3+ and Cu2+ yields metallic or weakly metallic states with soft ferrimagnetism below room temperature or even a non-magnetic state [4,5]; and partial replacement of Ru by Fe2+/Fe3+ yields narrow-gap semiconductors with magnetic transition temperatures as high as 490 K [4,24]. The difference in the transport behavior of R-type ferrites is a consequence of different electronic structures of these materials. As a possible explanation, we suggest that the increase of the density of electronic states as the 3d metal shifts from Ti to Zn closes a gap at the Fermi surface of Ti- and Fe-bearing ferrites, resulting in metallic behavior of Co-, Cu- and Zn-containing compounds. Below 12 K the resistivity can be fitted to a T 1.6-dependence. The best fit is shown in the inset of Fig. 7. In the limit T → 0 K, the Fermi liquid theory predicts a T 2-dependence of the electrical resistivity. The reduction of the resistivity exponent below 2 is expected for an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point, since the strong scattering of electrons takes place at particular antiferromagnetic wavevectors around the Fermi surface, allowing larger areas of the Fermi surface to “short out” this strong scattering with conventional Fermi-liquid transport [25]. The deviation of the data from this power law below 12 K is consistent with the NFL behavior and an estimate of the characteristic temperature T∼10 K derived from the magnetic properties. It is clear that the transport and magnetic properties of BaZnRu5O11 cannot be explained solely within the Fermi liquid theory. Therefore, we think that BaZnRu5O11 is a promising candidate to probe geometrical frustration in metallic systems and is likely to reveal new intriguing phenomena in low-temperature physics.

Crystal Structure:
Fig. 1 shows the usual unit cell of R-type ferrite compounds, for BaZnRu5O11 with a=5.8706(2) Å and c=13.6842(6) Å (in centrosymmetric space group P63/mmc). The crystal structure consists of layers of edge-sharing octahedra RuO6 which are interconnected in [001] direction via face-sharing octahedra-doubles Ru2O9 and trigonal bipyramids ZnO5. The latter metal atom within trigonal bipyramids is actually located in one of the two constituting tetrahedra, but typically static or dynamically disordered over both positions depending on temperature. Ordered cases were also described (typical description in the noncentrosymmetric space group P63 mc). It is worth pointing out, that the Ru atoms within the planes of edge-sharing octahedra for this subcell are arranged in the motif of an ideal kagome net with distances d(Ru–Ru)=2.9353(4) Å. This completely ordered arrangement of Ru and Zn within the different coordination environments was earlier described for, e. g., BaCuRu5O11 [5] and no indication for a significant disorder like in (Ba,Sr) M 2±x R u 4 + − x O 11 (M=Fe, Co) could be found [2–4]. These crystal structure refinements are in excellent agreement with the results from chemical analysis via μ-probe resulting in atomic ratios of n(Ba)/n(Zn)/n(Ru) of 0.98±1: 0.99±6: 5.01±6.
Taking additional weak superstructure reflections in the X-ray diffraction experiment into account a unit cell with a=11.7411(3) Å and c=13.6842(6) Å results. The reason for this superstructure lies mostly within the kagome nets, which distort because every two Ru atoms form pairs with short distances d(Ru–Ru) ≈ 2.632(1) Å, while the remaining interatomic separations within the plane are enlarged to about 3.0 Å. Fig. 2 gives an impression of the arrangement of the Ru–Ru pairs within the distorted kagome net. Similar pairing of d 5-Ru3+ ions is known from, e. g., β-RuCl3 [12]: In this crystal structure the Ru3+ ions are located in chains of face-sharing octahedra formed from Cl−. In the high-temperature form of RuCl3 above 206 K the Ru along the chain are arranged equidistant with d(Ru–Ru) ≈ 2.827 Å, in the low-temperature phase pair formation is observed with alternating distances of d(Ru–Ru) ≈ 2.633 Å and 3.001 Å. A similar, yet fundamentally different distortion of the kagome lattice of R-type ferrites has been observed, e. g., for the vanadates NaV6O11, SrV6O11 and PbV6O11 below 245 K, 320 K, and 560 K, respectively [13]. A more detailed structure discussion is given in another paper on isostructural compounds with the same type of distortion within the kagome plane [14].
It was indicated, that in units built from two face-sharing octahedra Ru2O9 the Ru–Ru distance is an indicative of the oxidation state of Ru, since the higher the oxidation state the larger the repulsion. The observed separations d(Ru–Ru)=2.653(2) Å/2.750(3) Å are in the expected range for Ru+4.5 and Ru+5 compared to data taken from a large number of fully ordered 6H-perovskite ruthenates [15,16]. Provided +2 for Ba and Zn and –2 for O charge balance leads to +3 for Ru within the kagome planes and in turn +4.5 for Ru in face-sharing octahedra as likely assignments for oxidation states.

Magnetic Properties:
The magnetic lattice of BaZnRu5O11 consists of 4d 5 Ru3+ (S=½) ions forming a distorted kagome lattice within the (001) plane, which is separated from the adjacent kagome layers by non-magnetic Zn2+ and doubles of ruthenium, with mixed Ru(IV)/Ru(V) valency according to crystal structure arguments (see above).
Fig. 3 shows data for the magnetic susceptibility χ=M/H for a BaZnRu5O11 single crystal oriented perpendicular to the c-axis in an applied field of μH=1 T. We did not find any evidence of magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K. A similar behavior of the magnetic susceptibility is observed when magnetic field is applied parallel to the c-axis (Fig. 4 ). As shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the inverse field-cooled (FC) dc-susceptibility (H⊥c) presents a change in slope above 50 K and a linear behavior above 100 K. A Curie–Weiss fit of the data in the temperature interval 100 < T < 300 K gives a Curie–Weiss temperature Θ W⊥=−290 K and an effective magnetic moment of 2.37 μ B/Ru, which is noticeably lower than the theoretical spin-only value of 3.87 μ B for Ru5+ (S=3/2), and only slightly reduced compared to the spin-only value of μeff=2.83 μB expected for Ru4+ (S=1). A deviation in the experimental value of the effective magnetic moment from the theoretical one expected for Ru5+ or Ru4+ could be attributed to strong hybridization between the Ru 4d and O 2p electronic states, which often leads to the loss of the local magnetic moment in ruthenium oxides [1] and to direct Ru–Ru bonding interactions.
The susceptibility of single crystals BaZnRu5O11 is anisotropic and is about two times lower for H∥c. Above 100 K χ∥ follows a Curie–Weiss law with Θ W∥=−230 K, and μ eff=1.78 μ B/Ru (inset in Fig. 3). This value is very close to the theoretical spin-only value of μ eff=1.73 μ B expected for trivalent low-spin Ru3+ (S=½) in octahedral coordination. The observed difference in effective magnetic moment for two crystallographic directions could be related to the different valence states of Ru within and between the kagome layers. The large negative Curie–Weiss temperature is consistent with the dominance of antiferromagnetic Ru–Ru interactions in the magnetic exchange within and between kagome layers. Therefore, in contrast to the strong ferrimagnets (Ba,Sr) M 2±x R u 4 + − x O 11 (M=Fe, Co, Mn) [4,6,7], the Zn analogue does not display long-range magnetic order down to 1.8 K. This result points to the presence of much stronger geometrical frustrations in the Zn-bearing compound due to the lack of disorder on the Ru sites of the kagome planes. The magnetization curves of BaZnRu5O11 are qualitatively the same for both field orientations, i. e., the isothermal magnetization increases with magnetic field in a linear manner without saturation at the maximum applied field of 5 T, showing a weak anisotropy (Fig. 5 ). This behavior is typical of weak magnetic materials.
We focus now our attention on the low-temperature region of the magnetic susceptibility. The low-temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of BaZnRu5O11 single crystals under a magnetic field of H=1 T applied perpendicular or parallel to the c-axis is presented in Fig. 6 . The main result is that the susceptibility below 6 K deviates from the Curie law, exhibiting a non-analytic temperature dependence of the form χ(T)∼1– T . The magnetic susceptibility of the sample can be fitted with the following expression: (1) χ=a − b T , where a=8.02 × 10−3 (3.44 × 10−3) emu/mol, and b=1.77 × 10−3 (4.2 × 10−4) emu/mol are the best fitting coefficients for H⊥c (H∥c). The square-root form of the low-temperature behavior of the bulk properties may indicate a non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior, which is frequently observed near low-temperature quantum critical point between paramagnetic and magnetically ordered states in metals with heavy quasiparticles [17]. Therefore, the low-temperature divergence of the magnetic susceptibility suggests the existence of unusual magnetic excitations, whose properties are distinct of those familiar Fermi-liquids. In current NFL theories developed for heavy fermion intermetallics [18], the role of geometrical frustration in the formation of NFL state near quantum criticality has not received much attention. However, there are indications that the geometrical frustration plays an important role in the development of quantum critical state in a number of metallic magnets based on frustrated lattices [19–22]. This issue remains unsettled and calls for systematic theoretical and experimental studies on a diverse set of novel metallic magnets based on geometrically frustrated lattices. BaZnRu5O11 seems to be a novel candidate for testing the influence of geometrical frustration on low-temperature properties of metallic magnets. It is instructive to view BaZnRu5O11 as an ordered version of R-type ferrites with strong magnetic frustrations inherent to the kagome planes located in (001) of this structure. In the isostructural Co-bearing (T c=105 K) metallic ferrite there is a 3d/4d disorder on the kagome net forming sites [4]. Consequently, the magnetic frustrations are reduced and long-range ferro-(ferri)-magnetic ordering occurs at relatively high temperatures. Upon substitution of Co with Zn the structural disorder in the kagome planes disappears. Furthermore, in the Zn-bearing compound, the electrons become more itinerant than in the Co-containing phase, most probably due to an increased number of 3d electrons and reduction of disorder in the system. Therefore, the magnetic frustrations in the kagome network cannot be removed, and no magnetic ordering is observed in BaZnRu5O11. However, Ru spins may still have the tendency to be ordered at very low temperatures due to distortion of the kagome lattice of BaZnRu5O11 as evidenced from the crystal structure refinement. In this situation the competition between the geometrical frustration and local coupling of Ru3+ spins on distorted kagome lattice may play an essential role in the precise nature of the ground state of BaZnRu5O11. The frustration due to lattice geometry in Ru3+ (S=1/2) triangular lattice antiferromagnet would result in infinite ground-state degeneracy with no long-range order at any temperature, however, in the presence of lattice distortion the residual interactions between the Ru spins tend to order the system magnetically. If these two processes are about equal in strength, than the system would be lying in the vicinity of a quantum critical point.

Electrical Resistivity:
The temperature dependences of the in-plane resistivity ρ(T) of the BaZnRu5O11 single crystal is shown in Fig. 7 . The positive slope dρ/dT gt; 0 and small variation of the resistivity from 5.1 to 3.4 mΩ cm as the temperature falls from 300 to 1 K allow to classify this material as a semimetal. Moreover, the basal-plane electrical resistance of our single crystal BaZnRu5O11 is ρ300 K about 5 mΩ cm, which is more than three orders of magnitude lower compared to semiconducting (Ba,Sr) F e 2±x R u 4 + − x O 11 analogues, and in the range of the typical metal BaCo1.8Ru4.2O11 [4]. It is particularly noteworthy that complete replacement of Ru (thought to be mixed valent 3+/5+ [2]) by Ti4+ yields a wide-gapped insulator [6,23], while partial replacement of Ru by Co2+/Co3+ and Cu2+ yields metallic or weakly metallic states with soft ferrimagnetism below room temperature or even a non-magnetic state [4,5]; and partial replacement of Ru by Fe2+/Fe3+ yields narrow-gap semiconductors with magnetic transition temperatures as high as 490 K [4,24]. The difference in the transport behavior of R-type ferrites is a consequence of different electronic structures of these materials. As a possible explanation, we suggest that the increase of the density of electronic states as the 3d metal shifts from Ti to Zn closes a gap at the Fermi surface of Ti- and Fe-bearing ferrites, resulting in metallic behavior of Co-, Cu- and Zn-containing compounds.
Below 12 K the resistivity can be fitted to a T 1.6-dependence. The best fit is shown in the inset of Fig. 7. In the limit T → 0 K, the Fermi liquid theory predicts a T 2-dependence of the electrical resistivity. The reduction of the resistivity exponent below 2 is expected for an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point, since the strong scattering of electrons takes place at particular antiferromagnetic wavevectors around the Fermi surface, allowing larger areas of the Fermi surface to “short out” this strong scattering with conventional Fermi-liquid transport [25]. The deviation of the data from this power law below 12 K is consistent with the NFL behavior and an estimate of the characteristic temperature T∼10 K derived from the magnetic properties. It is clear that the transport and magnetic properties of BaZnRu5O11 cannot be explained solely within the Fermi liquid theory. Therefore, we think that BaZnRu5O11 is a promising candidate to probe geometrical frustration in metallic systems and is likely to reveal new intriguing phenomena in low-temperature physics.

Conclusion:
BaZnRu5O11 presents an example of an ordered version of R-type ferrites with strong magnetic frustrations inherent to the (001) kagome planes of the crystal structure. The magnetic lattice of this compound is formed by Ru ions, which are coupled antiferromagnetically with a magnetic moment of μeff=2.83 μ B and μeff=1.73 μ B along and perpendicular to the c-axis, respectively. Despite the large negative Weiss temperature ΘW ⊥=−290 K (ΘW ∥=−230 K) no indication on magnetic order is observed down to 1.8 K in BaZnRu5O11. This suggests that the Ru3+ (S=1/2) spins are strongly frustrated within the kagome network of this compound. Our magnetic and transport measurements of BaZnRu5O11 single crystals have indicated an NFL behavior below about 10 K. We speculate that an important role in the formation of this state is played by competition between the geometrical frustration created by a two-dimensional kagome lattice of Ru3+ (S=1/2) spins and the residual Ru3+–Ru3+ spins interaction due to the lattice distortion. Clarification of the exact nature of the NFL state in BaZnRu5O11 requires further experimental investigations on this material.

Body:
Ruthenium oxides, one of the most interesting families of transition metal oxides, have been intensively investigated during the last decades due to their unusual physical properties. One of the most important features of 4d transition metal oxides is the large spatial extension of d electron orbitals. The 4d valence electrons of Ru are, therefore, expected to show weaker localization and should be more conducting than their 3d analogs. Furthermore, the extended d orbitals lead to significant d-p hybridization between the transition metal and oxygen, and enhance also crystalline-electric field effects. These features have shown to be responsible for the diversity of intriguing physical properties in ruthenium oxides (Ref. [1], and references therein).

Recently, we have succeeded in synthesizing ternary ruthenium ferrites with chemical formula (Ba,Sr) M 2±x R u 4 + − x O 11 (M=Fe, Co, Mn), which crystallize in the so-called R-type hexagonal structure [2–5]. The homogeneity range is generated by variable occupation of two octahedrally coordinated metal sites by 3d and 4d metals, while a trigonal-pyramidal (tetrahedrally) coordinated site is exclusively occupied by 3d metals (Fig. 1 ). Within (001) layers of edge-sharing octahedra (M,Ru)O6 are located, of which the central metal atoms form a kagome sublattice. An especially attractive characteristic of ternary ruthenium ferrites is that the magnetic and electrical properties of these materials can be widely varied by changing the ratio of the 3d/4d elements within the homogeneity range. It was found that some compositions of Fe-bearing ferrites exhibit a unique coexistence of narrow-gap semiconductivity with ferrimagnetic order below unusually high Curie temperatures TC∼490 K. The substitution of Fe2+/Fe3+ for Ru3+/Ru5+ appears to be vital for the control of the magnetic and transport properties, which makes R-type ferrites attractive for spintronic applications [3]. Furthermore, the consequent replacement of Fe2+/Fe3+ for Co2+ or for Cu2+ tunes the system from magnetic semiconductors to magnetic or even non-magnetic metals [3,6]. An interesting feature of the R-type ferrites family is that despite the magnetic frustration inherent for this structure, when canted antiferromagnetic order in Co or Mn analogous exists on the kagome planes, it is possible to produce a robust magnetic ground state with non-zero spin-chirality [6,7]. The presence of spin-chirality may play a crucial role in important phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity [8] and anomalous Hall effect [9–11]. Non-zero scalar chirality is known to drive locally a Hall current and leads to anomalous Hall effect of topological origin, which is independent of the conventional spin-orbit contribution and shows distinct low-temperature behavior. An abnormal Hall effect associated with the non-trivial spin configuration (non-zero scalar chirality) was observed in Co- and Mn-bearing ferrites [6,7].

In this paper we report the magnetic properties of single crystals BaZnRu5O11, which are closely related to crystal structure details. We also briefly compare the properties of BaZnRu5O11 to those of R-type Fe, Co or Mn ferrites investigated in our previous studies [3–5,7]. In contrast to the previously studied members of the R-type family no 3d/4d disorder is observed in BaZnRu5O11. The study of the fully ordered compound would be of great importance since the ordered structure appears to relieve the magnetic frustration within the distorted kagome planes extending in (001). Hence, the formation of different ground states within one structural family and the access to the quantum critical state becomes possible.

Single crystals of BaZnRu5O11 were grown in the form of black, hexagonal plates from BaCl2 flux, as described elsewhere [2]. Well shaped crystals were selected for single crystal X-ray diffraction data collection. The measurements were performed using a 4 circle diffractometer (NONIUS-κ-CCD, Bruker AXS GmbH) with monochromatic MoK α radiation. Selected information concerning the data collection and structure refinements are gathered in Tables 1–4 . Further details of the crystal structure investigations may be obtained from Fachinformationszentrum Karlsruhe, 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany (fax: +49-7247-808-666; e-mail: crysdata@fiz-karlsruhe.de, http://www.fiz-informationsienste.de/en/DB/icsd/depot_anforderung.html) on quoting the deposition number CSD-423536.

Chemical μ-probe analyses result in very consistent compositions observed for all crystals investigated, and the inferred atomic density ratios n(Ba)/n(Zn)/n(Ru)=0.98±1: 0.99±6: 5.01±6 (the oxygen content could not be quantified with this technique) are in excellent agreement with the composition BaZnRu5O11 obtained from the X-ray diffraction data refinements. No additional elements were detected.

The DC magnetization of oriented single crystals was measured over a temperature range 2K ≤ T ≤ 300 K in applied magnetic fields 0 ≤ μ o H ≤ 5 T using a Quantum Design MPMS7 Magnetometer. The electrical resistivity was measured by a standard dc-method in the temperature range 1K ≤ T ≤ 300 K.

Fig. 1 shows the usual unit cell of R-type ferrite compounds, for BaZnRu5O11 with a=5.8706(2) Å and c=13.6842(6) Å (in centrosymmetric space group P63/mmc). The crystal structure consists of layers of edge-sharing octahedra RuO6 which are interconnected in [001] direction via face-sharing octahedra-doubles Ru2O9 and trigonal bipyramids ZnO5. The latter metal atom within trigonal bipyramids is actually located in one of the two constituting tetrahedra, but typically static or dynamically disordered over both positions depending on temperature. Ordered cases were also described (typical description in the noncentrosymmetric space group P63 mc). It is worth pointing out, that the Ru atoms within the planes of edge-sharing octahedra for this subcell are arranged in the motif of an ideal kagome net with distances d(Ru–Ru)=2.9353(4) Å. This completely ordered arrangement of Ru and Zn within the different coordination environments was earlier described for, e. g., BaCuRu5O11 [5] and no indication for a significant disorder like in (Ba,Sr) M 2±x R u 4 + − x O 11 (M=Fe, Co) could be found [2–4]. These crystal structure refinements are in excellent agreement with the results from chemical analysis via μ-probe resulting in atomic ratios of n(Ba)/n(Zn)/n(Ru) of 0.98±1: 0.99±6: 5.01±6.

Taking additional weak superstructure reflections in the X-ray diffraction experiment into account a unit cell with a=11.7411(3) Å and c=13.6842(6) Å results. The reason for this superstructure lies mostly within the kagome nets, which distort because every two Ru atoms form pairs with short distances d(Ru–Ru) ≈ 2.632(1) Å, while the remaining interatomic separations within the plane are enlarged to about 3.0 Å. Fig. 2 gives an impression of the arrangement of the Ru–Ru pairs within the distorted kagome net. Similar pairing of d 5-Ru3+ ions is known from, e. g., β-RuCl3 [12]: In this crystal structure the Ru3+ ions are located in chains of face-sharing octahedra formed from Cl−. In the high-temperature form of RuCl3 above 206 K the Ru along the chain are arranged equidistant with d(Ru–Ru) ≈ 2.827 Å, in the low-temperature phase pair formation is observed with alternating distances of d(Ru–Ru) ≈ 2.633 Å and 3.001 Å. A similar, yet fundamentally different distortion of the kagome lattice of R-type ferrites has been observed, e. g., for the vanadates NaV6O11, SrV6O11 and PbV6O11 below 245 K, 320 K, and 560 K, respectively [13]. A more detailed structure discussion is given in another paper on isostructural compounds with the same type of distortion within the kagome plane [14].

It was indicated, that in units built from two face-sharing octahedra Ru2O9 the Ru–Ru distance is an indicative of the oxidation state of Ru, since the higher the oxidation state the larger the repulsion. The observed separations d(Ru–Ru)=2.653(2) Å/2.750(3) Å are in the expected range for Ru+4.5 and Ru+5 compared to data taken from a large number of fully ordered 6H-perovskite ruthenates [15,16]. Provided +2 for Ba and Zn and –2 for O charge balance leads to +3 for Ru within the kagome planes and in turn +4.5 for Ru in face-sharing octahedra as likely assignments for oxidation states.

The magnetic lattice of BaZnRu5O11 consists of 4d 5 Ru3+ (S=½) ions forming a distorted kagome lattice within the (001) plane, which is separated from the adjacent kagome layers by non-magnetic Zn2+ and doubles of ruthenium, with mixed Ru(IV)/Ru(V) valency according to crystal structure arguments (see above).

Fig. 3 shows data for the magnetic susceptibility χ=M/H for a BaZnRu5O11 single crystal oriented perpendicular to the c-axis in an applied field of μH=1 T. We did not find any evidence of magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K. A similar behavior of the magnetic susceptibility is observed when magnetic field is applied parallel to the c-axis (Fig. 4 ). As shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the inverse field-cooled (FC) dc-susceptibility (H⊥c) presents a change in slope above 50 K and a linear behavior above 100 K. A Curie–Weiss fit of the data in the temperature interval 100 < T < 300 K gives a Curie–Weiss temperature Θ W⊥=−290 K and an effective magnetic moment of 2.37 μ B/Ru, which is noticeably lower than the theoretical spin-only value of 3.87 μ B for Ru5+ (S=3/2), and only slightly reduced compared to the spin-only value of μeff=2.83 μB expected for Ru4+ (S=1). A deviation in the experimental value of the effective magnetic moment from the theoretical one expected for Ru5+ or Ru4+ could be attributed to strong hybridization between the Ru 4d and O 2p electronic states, which often leads to the loss of the local magnetic moment in ruthenium oxides [1] and to direct Ru–Ru bonding interactions.

The susceptibility of single crystals BaZnRu5O11 is anisotropic and is about two times lower for H∥c. Above 100 K χ∥ follows a Curie–Weiss law with Θ W∥=−230 K, and μ eff=1.78 μ B/Ru (inset in Fig. 3). This value is very close to the theoretical spin-only value of μ eff=1.73 μ B expected for trivalent low-spin Ru3+ (S=½) in octahedral coordination. The observed difference in effective magnetic moment for two crystallographic directions could be related to the different valence states of Ru within and between the kagome layers. The large negative Curie–Weiss temperature is consistent with the dominance of antiferromagnetic Ru–Ru interactions in the magnetic exchange within and between kagome layers. Therefore, in contrast to the strong ferrimagnets (Ba,Sr) M 2±x R u 4 + − x O 11 (M=Fe, Co, Mn) [4,6,7], the Zn analogue does not display long-range magnetic order down to 1.8 K. This result points to the presence of much stronger geometrical frustrations in the Zn-bearing compound due to the lack of disorder on the Ru sites of the kagome planes. The magnetization curves of BaZnRu5O11 are qualitatively the same for both field orientations, i. e., the isothermal magnetization increases with magnetic field in a linear manner without saturation at the maximum applied field of 5 T, showing a weak anisotropy (Fig. 5 ). This behavior is typical of weak magnetic materials.

We focus now our attention on the low-temperature region of the magnetic susceptibility. The low-temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of BaZnRu5O11 single crystals under a magnetic field of H=1 T applied perpendicular or parallel to the c-axis is presented in Fig. 6 . The main result is that the susceptibility below 6 K deviates from the Curie law, exhibiting a non-analytic temperature dependence of the form χ(T)∼1– T . The magnetic susceptibility of the sample can be fitted with the following expression: (1) χ=a − b T , where a=8.02 × 10−3 (3.44 × 10−3) emu/mol, and b=1.77 × 10−3 (4.2 × 10−4) emu/mol are the best fitting coefficients for H⊥c (H∥c). The square-root form of the low-temperature behavior of the bulk properties may indicate a non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior, which is frequently observed near low-temperature quantum critical point between paramagnetic and magnetically ordered states in metals with heavy quasiparticles [17]. Therefore, the low-temperature divergence of the magnetic susceptibility suggests the existence of unusual magnetic excitations, whose properties are distinct of those familiar Fermi-liquids. In current NFL theories developed for heavy fermion intermetallics [18], the role of geometrical frustration in the formation of NFL state near quantum criticality has not received much attention. However, there are indications that the geometrical frustration plays an important role in the development of quantum critical state in a number of metallic magnets based on frustrated lattices [19–22]. This issue remains unsettled and calls for systematic theoretical and experimental studies on a diverse set of novel metallic magnets based on geometrically frustrated lattices. BaZnRu5O11 seems to be a novel candidate for testing the influence of geometrical frustration on low-temperature properties of metallic magnets. It is instructive to view BaZnRu5O11 as an ordered version of R-type ferrites with strong magnetic frustrations inherent to the kagome planes located in (001) of this structure. In the isostructural Co-bearing (T c=105 K) metallic ferrite there is a 3d/4d disorder on the kagome net forming sites [4]. Consequently, the magnetic frustrations are reduced and long-range ferro-(ferri)-magnetic ordering occurs at relatively high temperatures. Upon substitution of Co with Zn the structural disorder in the kagome planes disappears. Furthermore, in the Zn-bearing compound, the electrons become more itinerant than in the Co-containing phase, most probably due to an increased number of 3d electrons and reduction of disorder in the system. Therefore, the magnetic frustrations in the kagome network cannot be removed, and no magnetic ordering is observed in BaZnRu5O11. However, Ru spins may still have the tendency to be ordered at very low temperatures due to distortion of the kagome lattice of BaZnRu5O11 as evidenced from the crystal structure refinement. In this situation the competition between the geometrical frustration and local coupling of Ru3+ spins on distorted kagome lattice may play an essential role in the precise nature of the ground state of BaZnRu5O11. The frustration due to lattice geometry in Ru3+ (S=1/2) triangular lattice antiferromagnet would result in infinite ground-state degeneracy with no long-range order at any temperature, however, in the presence of lattice distortion the residual interactions between the Ru spins tend to order the system magnetically. If these two processes are about equal in strength, than the system would be lying in the vicinity of a quantum critical point.

The temperature dependences of the in-plane resistivity ρ(T) of the BaZnRu5O11 single crystal is shown in Fig. 7 . The positive slope dρ/dT gt; 0 and small variation of the resistivity from 5.1 to 3.4 mΩ cm as the temperature falls from 300 to 1 K allow to classify this material as a semimetal. Moreover, the basal-plane electrical resistance of our single crystal BaZnRu5O11 is ρ300 K about 5 mΩ cm, which is more than three orders of magnitude lower compared to semiconducting (Ba,Sr) F e 2±x R u 4 + − x O 11 analogues, and in the range of the typical metal BaCo1.8Ru4.2O11 [4]. It is particularly noteworthy that complete replacement of Ru (thought to be mixed valent 3+/5+ [2]) by Ti4+ yields a wide-gapped insulator [6,23], while partial replacement of Ru by Co2+/Co3+ and Cu2+ yields metallic or weakly metallic states with soft ferrimagnetism below room temperature or even a non-magnetic state [4,5]; and partial replacement of Ru by Fe2+/Fe3+ yields narrow-gap semiconductors with magnetic transition temperatures as high as 490 K [4,24]. The difference in the transport behavior of R-type ferrites is a consequence of different electronic structures of these materials. As a possible explanation, we suggest that the increase of the density of electronic states as the 3d metal shifts from Ti to Zn closes a gap at the Fermi surface of Ti- and Fe-bearing ferrites, resulting in metallic behavior of Co-, Cu- and Zn-containing compounds.

Below 12 K the resistivity can be fitted to a T 1.6-dependence. The best fit is shown in the inset of Fig. 7. In the limit T → 0 K, the Fermi liquid theory predicts a T 2-dependence of the electrical resistivity. The reduction of the resistivity exponent below 2 is expected for an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point, since the strong scattering of electrons takes place at particular antiferromagnetic wavevectors around the Fermi surface, allowing larger areas of the Fermi surface to “short out” this strong scattering with conventional Fermi-liquid transport [25]. The deviation of the data from this power law below 12 K is consistent with the NFL behavior and an estimate of the characteristic temperature T∼10 K derived from the magnetic properties. It is clear that the transport and magnetic properties of BaZnRu5O11 cannot be explained solely within the Fermi liquid theory. Therefore, we think that BaZnRu5O11 is a promising candidate to probe geometrical frustration in metallic systems and is likely to reveal new intriguing phenomena in low-temperature physics.

BaZnRu5O11 presents an example of an ordered version of R-type ferrites with strong magnetic frustrations inherent to the (001) kagome planes of the crystal structure. The magnetic lattice of this compound is formed by Ru ions, which are coupled antiferromagnetically with a magnetic moment of μeff=2.83 μ B and μeff=1.73 μ B along and perpendicular to the c-axis, respectively. Despite the large negative Weiss temperature ΘW ⊥=−290 K (ΘW ∥=−230 K) no indication on magnetic order is observed down to 1.8 K in BaZnRu5O11. This suggests that the Ru3+ (S=1/2) spins are strongly frustrated within the kagome network of this compound. Our magnetic and transport measurements of BaZnRu5O11 single crystals have indicated an NFL behavior below about 10 K. We speculate that an important role in the formation of this state is played by competition between the geometrical frustration created by a two-dimensional kagome lattice of Ru3+ (S=1/2) spins and the residual Ru3+–Ru3+ spins interaction due to the lattice distortion. Clarification of the exact nature of the NFL state in BaZnRu5O11 requires further experimental investigations on this material.

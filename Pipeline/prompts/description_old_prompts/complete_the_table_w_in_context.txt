Title:
Amoxicillin embedded in cellulose acetate-poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) fibers prepared by coaxial electrospinning: Preparation and characterization

Abstract:
The optimal conditions for the preparation of a composite material of fibers of cellulose acetate (CA), poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), containing amoxicillin (Amoxi) within the fiber, CA/PVP-Amoxi/CA, were found. The geometrical, physical–chemical and thermal properties of the fibrous membranes containing CA, PVP and amoxicillin were characterized using FTIR spectroscopy, thermal analysis, SEM and TEM. Also, mechanical characterization of the fibers showed that the tensile strength of the membrane is not affected by the presence of amoxicillin within the fiber as compared with fibers without amoxicillin; however, the rigidity of the membrane decreases by approximately 45%. The effect of the pH on the release rate of amoxicillin was also studied. The amount of amoxicillin release and the k value increased with an increasing pH, from 61% for a pH 3.0 to 79% at pH 7.2, with k values of 0.2120 and 0.2609 respectively. An empirical model for the amoxicillin release was studied; the release of amoxicillin is assumed to obey a diffusion mechanism. These composite materials are recommended for solving the problem of possible loss of drug during the process of entrapment in the matrix with potential local application in biological media to treat dental or skin infections.

Introduction:
Coaxial electrospinning has been used in different materials, such as membranes composed of dextran and poly(l-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) [1], poly(l-lactic acid) and tetracycline hydrochloride [2], composite fibers of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) with the liquid crystal 4-cyano-4′-octylbiphenyl in its smectic phase [3], poly(vinylpyrrolidone)/poly(l-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) [4], poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and N,N-dimethylacetamide [5], biodegradable nanofibrous mats [6], polycaprolactone with incorporated protein [7], poly ethylene terephthalate with Fe3O4 nanoparticles [8], and others.
Likewise, materials prepared by the electrospinning method have been used for different applications, such as drug delivery systems [9,10], tissue engineering [11,12], vascular grafts [13], fibrous filtering membranes [14], and in general for biomedical and biotechnological applications [15,16].
There are many factors that affect the optimal preparation of fibers by the electrospinning method, for example, temperature and humidity [17], solvent used [18], and polymer concentrations [19]. To obtain fibers with specific characteristics, a systematic work is necessary. Therefore, different variables are studied including the following: applied voltage, flow rate, distance between the needle and the collector plate and concentration of solutions and mixtures of solvents used.
In a previous article we reported the preparation of fibrous membranes of cellulose acetate and poly (vinylpyrrolidone) by the electrospinning method, using an array of two needles placed side by side [20]. In another article, we reported the preparation, characterization and release of amoxicillin from cellulose acetate and poly (vinylpyrrolidone) coaxially electrospun fibrous membranes [21].
However, the loading of amoxicillin in the fibers has certain problems because it was not possible to know the exact amount of amoxicillin incorporated into the fibers to be able to estimate the percentage of amoxicillin release (%).
In this work we present the feasibility of producing a fibrous composite membrane via coaxial electrospinning using both the CA and the PVP, with the amoxicillin embedded within the PVP, also, determination of the optimal conditions for the preparation, and the characterization of the geometrical, physical–chemical and mechanical properties using SEM, TEM, FTIR, thermal, mechanical, as well as the evaluation of the release rate of amoxicillin using the model proposed by Ritger and Peppas, at both pH 3 and 7.2. This study aims to develop materials that will allow the solution of problems of possible loss of drug during the tedious process of entrapment in the matrix.

Materials And Methods:
2.1 Materials The materials used in this study included cellulose acetate (CA) powder, 39.7wt% acetyl content, an average Mn of 50,000 (Aldrich); poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) white powder and average Mw of 360,000 (Aldrich); acetone, 99.7% (Aldrich); ethanol, 99.6% (Aldrich); amoxicillin (Sigma); sodium phosphate, dibasic (Meyer); sodium phosphate monobasic, monohydrate, crystal, (J.T. Baker); sodium hydroxide, pellets (Meyer); citric acid, monohydrate (Merck). All reagents, with the exception of amoxicillin, were used as received.
2.2 Fibrous membrane preparation by coaxial electrospinning For the preparation of a cellulose acetate-poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) fibrous membrane, CA/PVP-Amoxi/CA with amoxicillin incorporated into the fiber, a careful study of all the variables was performed. The variables studied were, the concentration of the polymer solution, the applied voltage, the flow of the solution, and the distance between the needle and the collector plate. In the case of the CA solution, an acetone–water mixture was used as a solvent with a polymer concentration of 8% W. For 5ml of a PVP solution an ethanol–water mixture was used with a polymer concentration of 8% W; 0.5g of sodium salt of amoxicillin was added. The solutions were transferred to the plastic syringes together with a syringe pump KDS Scientific, whose flow rate was varied in the range of 0.3–3.0mlh−1. A high voltage of 11–18kV was applied to the polymer solution, using a high-voltage power supply (Spellman, model CZE 1000R). Finally, the distance between the needle and the collector plate was set at 15cm. A square plate of aluminum (10cm×10cm) was used as a collector.
2.3 FTIR characterization Dried membranes were mixed with KBr powder and pelletized. The IR characterizations were performed using a Perkin–Elmer Spectrum GX FTIR spectrometer.
2.4 Thermal analysis Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out, using a DSC–TGA TA instruments model SDT 2960. Samples of approximately 6mg were taken, and heated from room temperature to 590°C, with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1, under a continuous flow of air of 23mlmin−1.
2.5 Mechanical analysis Tensile test was performed using a micro tensiometer equipped with a 250g load cell at a constant crosshead speed of 1.2mm/min. Before and during testing, the samples were conditioned at a 60% relative humidity and a room temperature of 25°C.
2.6 SEM imaging The morphology of the fibrous membranes was evaluated using a JEOL 5410LV scanning electron microscope (SEM), operated at both, 25kV, and 20kV. The samples were gold-sputtered prior to the SEM examination.
2.7 TEM imaging For the transmission electron microscopy imaging (TEM), a sample of the membrane was placed on a carbon film supported by a copper grid in order to obtain electron micrographs in a JEOL 2010F Electron Microscope.
2.8 Effect of pH on the release of amoxicillin In order to study the drug release kinetics, the membrane samples containing amoxicillin were immersed in 400ml of a buffer solution and were maintained with continuous magnetic agitation at 25°C. The release at both pH 3 and 7.2 was investigated. At certain time intervals, 100μl was taken out from each release system and was diluted to a final volume of 3ml. The cumulative amount of amoxicillin released at each time sampling was determined by UV–vis spectroscopy to 273nm using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 20 UV–vis spectrophotometer system. This experiment was repeated until the absorbance values were constant, that is, when the equilibrium of released drug was reached. The amounts of amoxicillin released were determined by interpolation of absorbance values in a calibration curve previously developed.
2.9 Empirical model for the amoxicillin release rate Theoretical studies by other authors [22,23] have identified a number of factors which may affect the rate at which a particular solute is released from a polymeric matrix into a liquid phase. In this study, an overall evaluation of the rate of amoxicillin release from the fibrous membrane, CA/PVP-Amoxi/CA, was done according to the exponential model developed by Ritger and Peppas [22]: (1) M t M ∞=k t n where M t and M ∞ are the mass of amoxicillin released at time t and ∞, respectively; k is a kinetic constant, and n is the diffusion exponent that can be related to the drug transport mechanism.

Effect Of Ph On The Release Of Amoxicillin:
In order to study the drug release kinetics, the membrane samples containing amoxicillin were immersed in 400ml of a buffer solution and were maintained with continuous magnetic agitation at 25°C. The release at both pH 3 and 7.2 was investigated. At certain time intervals, 100μl was taken out from each release system and was diluted to a final volume of 3ml. The cumulative amount of amoxicillin released at each time sampling was determined by UV–vis spectroscopy to 273nm using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 20 UV–vis spectrophotometer system. This experiment was repeated until the absorbance values were constant, that is, when the equilibrium of released drug was reached. The amounts of amoxicillin released were determined by interpolation of absorbance values in a calibration curve previously developed.

Empirical Model For The Amoxicillin Release Rate:
Theoretical studies by other authors [22,23] have identified a number of factors which may affect the rate at which a particular solute is released from a polymeric matrix into a liquid phase. In this study, an overall evaluation of the rate of amoxicillin release from the fibrous membrane, CA/PVP-Amoxi/CA, was done according to the exponential model developed by Ritger and Peppas [22]: (1) M t M ∞=k t n
where M t and M ∞ are the mass of amoxicillin released at time t and ∞, respectively; k is a kinetic constant, and n is the diffusion exponent that can be related to the drug transport mechanism.

Results And Discussion:
After a systematic study varying the conditions for the coaxial electrospinning method, the optimal conditions for the preparation of cellulose acetate-poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) fibers with embedded amoxicillin (CA/PVP-Amoxi/CA) were found; flow rate of 0.5mlh−1 and a high voltage of 15kV were applied to the polymer solution.
The FTIR spectroscopy of the fibers was performed in order to corroborate the existence of amoxicillin in CA/PVP-Amoxi/CA before and after the release of amoxicillin at both pH 3.0 and 7.2. The following characteristic peaks were observed: for CA, there is an ester stretching peak at around 1748cm−1, Fig. 1(a); for PVP, the band at 1665cm−1 is attributed to C═O stretching vibration of the amide group, Fig. 1(b); for amoxicillin, an amide stretching wide band at 3434cm−1, Fig. 1(c); for the CA/PVP-Amoxi/CA, characteristic peaks of CA, PVP and amoxicillin were observed, demonstrating the existence of amoxicillin in the fiber, Fig. 1(d). After release of the amoxicillin, at both pH values, the peaks of PVP and amoxicillin almost disappear showing a lack of PVP which is highly soluble in water and of amoxicillin, Fig. 1(e) and (f).
Analysis of weight loss as a function of temperature was performed for CA/PVP-Amoxi/CA membranes. Fig. 2(a) shows the thermogram of these membranes. It can be seen, that even at 590°C there is no complete degradation of the materials, and this can be explained by the presence of residual NaOH used to obtain the sodium salt of amoxicillin. The first significant weight loss, marked as (1) in Fig. 2(a), at 100°C is attributed to the loss of moisture and solvent adsorbed in the fibers. Three additional weight losses between 150°C and 500°C, marked as (2), (3) and (4) are observed in Fig. 2(a), are attributed to amoxicillin, CA and PVP, respectively. Making these assignments based on the analysis of weight loss of CA fibers and PVP fibers prepared by electrospinning, and sodium salt of amoxicillin, Fig. 2(b), for a weight loss around 300°C and 400°C respectively for CA and PVP fibers. Amoxicillin shows a weight loss around 200°C.
The presence of the amoxicillin on the CA/PVP/CA electro spun fibers [21] seems to have an effect on their mechanical properties, especially on their rigidity. Strictly speaking, the amoxicillin located in the central portion of the composite fiber and this drug is later diffused out of the fiber. No strong interactions are expected between the polymer and amoxicillin and there are no noticeable effects on either the tensile strength or the strain at break of the membrane. However, the rigidity of the membrane decreases by approximately 45%.
To study the morphology of the membranes and verify that the fibers are formed, SEM and TEM micrographs were done. Fig. 3(a) shows the fibrous membrane CA/PVP-Amoxi/CA before the release of amoxicillin. Fibers with cylindrical shape with diameter values around 1.5μm can be observed. In the case of the membranes CA/PVP-Amoxi/CA after amoxicillin release at pH 7.2, hollow fibers can be observed without the original cylindrical shape, Fig. 3(b), suggesting that PVP and amoxicillin were removed from the fiber. Membranes CA/PVP-Amoxi/CA after release amoxicillin at pH 3.0 shown in Fig. 3(c) can be observed and a more noticeable deterioration of the fiber attributed to the highly acidic conditions of the environment and subsequent release of PVP and amoxicillin. Fig. 3(d) shows the TEM micrographs for the fibrous membrane CA/PVP-Amoxi/CA before the release of amoxicillin, homogeneous fibers with a little dark area in the core of the fiber can be seen, there are no empty spaces as an Fig. 3(e) and (f) after release of amoxicillin and PVP at pH 7.2 and 3.0 respectively.
The effect of the pH on the amoxicillin release (pH 3.0 and pH 7.2) was analyzed through the kinetics of release, Fig. 3(g). The amoxicillin release kinetics from a CA/PVP-Amoxi/CA membrane in buffer solutions with pH 7.2 and 3.0 showed a final percentage of amoxicillin release of 79 at pH 7.2 and 61 at pH 3.0, both at 48h. The release at pH=7.2 is higher than at pH=3.0. These results are in agreement with those reported previously [21]; amoxicillin has the ability to form hydrogen bonds with the other components of the fiber when it is at pH 3, thus reducing its release into the environment.
Parameters k and n were obtained by plotting the experimental values of ln(M t /M ∞ ) versus ln(t) and fitting the data to a straight line. The parameter n was obtained from the slope of this plot, whereas parameter k was obtained from the intersection at ln(t)=0. Table 1 summarizes the results thus obtained. In general, the kinetic constant k, increased as the pH increased. This is consistent with the previous discussion and the values of the amount of amoxicillin release in 10min, 24h and 48h shown in Table 1. On the other hand, the parameter n decreased as the pH increased; this trend is observed in hydrogel amoxicillin releasing [24] and explained by formation or no formation of hydrogen bonds. Also, for a cylindrical geometry, a value of n equal to 0.45 or less corresponds to a Fickian diffusion mechanism [25]. Values of n between 0.26 and 0.31 indicate that the transport mechanism could be Fickian [26]. Then, according to the results obtained from the characterization of the material, a mechanism of diffusion is proposed for the release of amoxicillin from the fiber core to the surrounding medium.

Conclusions:
The optimal conditions for the preparation of fibers of cellulose acetate, poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) containing amoxicillin within the fiber were found; the physical and morphological characteristics of these fibrous membranes were corroborated by FTIR spectroscopy, thermal analysis, SEM and TEM. Formation of composite fibers of CA and PVP containing amoxicillin was evidenced. From the mechanical characterization of the fibrous membranes, in general, it can be said that the mechanical properties of the material are not affected by the presence of amoxicillin within the fiber. The effect of the pH on the release of amoxicillin was also studied. The percentage of amoxicillin release and k value was increased with the increased in pH. The release of amoxicillin was studied following an empirical model and from the parameters obtained, the release of amoxicillin may occur by diffusion. These materials are recommended for potential local application in biological media as dental or skin infections.

Title:
Synthesis  characterization  photophysical and electrochemical properties of a new non−planar perylene diimide with electron donating substituent

Abstract:
A new nonplanar and soluble, donor−acceptor−donor system (3) based on a perylene diimide chromophore (1) consisting on 5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide (2) as electron donating unit at imide position has been synthesized. The photophysical and electrochemical properties were systematically investigated in different solvents. All the results of structural characterization reveal that the thiophene units are not coplanar with the core of perylene diimide. Spectroscopic properties of 3 in solution show variations with the organic solvent used. In the polar aprotic and strongly electron donating solvents, such as DMF, DMAC and NMP, 3 exhibits intense absorption features in the UV–visible absorption spectrum covering the wavelength range of 300–800 nm with excellent absorptivity. Photoinduced electronic excitation energy transfer was noticed in polar aprotic solvents from electron donating substituent to the perylene core. The non-planar geometry of 3 prevented efficient energy transfer between donor and acceptor.

Introduction:
Development of novel materials with optimal structural properties, thermal, photochemical and electrochemical stabilities plays an important role in the research for a sustainable energy future. Thiophenes and perylenes substituted donor−acceptor architectures have been extensively investigated as the most promising class of materials in energy transfer and light−harvesting systems for photovoltaic devices [1–4]. Perylene dyes are particularly important compounds due to their stupendous absorption and emission in the spectral region from visible to near infrared (NIR), photochemical and electrochemical properties, and thermal, chemical and photochemical stabilities [1–7]. The problems such as poor solubility and high tendency to aggregate in solutions can be solved using different synthetic strategies [5–8]. Thiophenes are well known class of donor materials with their low band gap features, excellent charge transport properties and stabilities [9–12]. Charge transfer interactions in hydrogen bonded donor/acceptor systems, ambipolar field−effect transistors, different molecular architectures (acceptor−donor, acceptor−donor−acceptor and donor−acceptor−donor), and alternating copolysiloxane with terthiophene donor/perylendiimide acceptor systems have been investigated and reported [9–12]. Highly stable and soluble bay−substituted thiophenes/perylenediimide donor−acceptor systems with low band gap have shown tunable charge−transport properties [13–18]. Moreover, the disappearance of charge−transfer absorption band of bay−substituted green color perylene dyes has been explained via protonation which can be challenging for color-tunable products technologies [18]. On the other hand, perylene polymers have attracted considerable interest with their strong absorption and fluorescence, electrochemical and photochemical properties, and excellent stabilities. However, special synthetic techniques are needed for these polymers in order to overcome the poor solubility and aggregation limitations [19–24].
For the purpose of achieving broad and intense absorption and improved light harvesting properties, specifically, thiophenes were chosen in the donor−π bridge−acceptor−π bridge−donor polymers and low molecular weight materials as electron−donating units since they are known to be one of the most powerful organic electron donors (OED) [9–12].
In our work reported here, unlike the common donor−π bridge−acceptor−π bridge−donor structures with high molecular weights, a mimic of donor−acceptor−donor architecture was designed by using a multisubstituted thiophene (5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide) and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride. More specifically, we were interested in investigating low molecular weight donor−acceptor−donor system material with low bandgap, high solubility and strong electron donating/accepting ability with controllable conductivity. The band gap energy of such models can be reduced by raising the HOMO energy level selectively via powerful electron donors [1–4].
When designing the system, we considered the following important characteristics: i) The amine, 5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide (2) has three different substituents which can hinder molecular packing and increase solubility, ii) the two different electron-withdrawing substituents (cyano and amide) present in amine unit can lead to high electron affinity, iii) controllable, high electron conjugation within the molecule can extend the absorption to near infrared region for developing novel low band gap materials for photonic technology, iv) the hydrogen bonding ability of cyano substituent may control the conductivity of molecule, v) the two units, 5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide and perylenediimide, do not absorb in the same spectral regions but the fluorescence of amine overlaps well with the absorption of perylenediimide, which makes the couple adequate to achieve effective light harvesting and photoinduced electron transfer. Photophysical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized architecture in solution and solid state are investigated in detail.

Experimental:
2.1 Materials and general methods Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (1), 5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide (2), zinc acetate, isoquinoline and m-cresol were obtained from Aldrich. Isoquinoline and m-cresol were dried over activate 4 Å molecular sieves and distilled freshly prior to use. Sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF4) and ferrocene were purchased from Fluka and used as received. The solvents for spectroscopic studies were of spectroscopic grade. FTIR spectra were recorded on Mattson (USA) satellite FT-IR spectrophotometer from KBr pellets. Mass spectral data were recorded on Finnigan MAT 311A instrument and the data were represented in m/z (%) values. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on 400 MHz Bruker spectrophotometer, respectively using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) and deuterated trifluoroacetic acid (CF3CO2D). UV–Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian-Cary 100 spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectra on a Varian-Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer. Elemental analyses were measured on a Carlo Erba-1106 (C, H, and N) elemental analyzer. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) thermograms were obtained on Perkin Elmer/DSC/Jade DSC under nitrogen atmosphere and Perkin Elmer/TGA/Pyris 1 under oxygen, respectively, with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. All electrochemical measurements in solution and solid-state were performed on Gamry instruments workstation equipped with a PC computer monitoring Reference 600 Potensiostat/Galvanostat/ZRA system. Redox data from cyclic (CV) and square-wave voltammetry (SWV) measurements were obtained using a three-electrode system throughout the work, which are working-glassy carbon, counter-platinum wire, and reference-Ag/AgCl electrodes. The glassy carbon electrode was polished carefully with 0.05 μm alumina slurry to a mirror finish prior to use. The supporting electrolyte (0.1 M NaBF4 in dimethyl formamide (DMF)) solution was measured first to produce a blank surface and added the 3 (1.2 × 10−4 M) to measure their redox potentials with an internal reference ferrocene.

Results And Discussion:
3.1 Synthesis and characterization The synthesis of the new perylene dye, 3 is outlined in Scheme 1 . The imidization proceeded mainly through the amine nitrogen as expected. It is noteworthy that the polycondensation was prevented by using a large excess of 5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide, 2. The structure of the compound 3 was characterized by 1HNMR, 13CNMR, MS, IR and elemental analysis; the results clearly support the predicted chemical structure of 3 (Scheme 1). Representative 3D molecular structures of 3 at different energy levels (all rendered using MarvinSketch by ChemAxon) show clearly the non-planarity (Scheme 2 ). Table 1 lists the solubility of 3 in various organic solvents. One observes a high degree of solubility both in strong dipolar aprotic solvents, such as NMP, DMAC, DMF and DMSO, and in polar protic solvent such TFAc at room temperature. However, 3 is only partially soluble in nonpolar (TCE, CH2Cl2) and polar protic solvents (ETOH, MeOH) at 35 °C. The presence of cyano substituents sterically hinders the coplanar arrangement of the thiophene units with perylene core. Therefore, the short π-π contacts of fluorophores are prevented. Since the strong self-aggregation is hindered a high degree of solubility is observed in those organic solvents.
3.2 Photophysical properties The electronic absorption and emission spectra (1 × 10−5 M, λ exc=485 nm) of 3 recorded in nonpolar, polar protic and aprotic solvents and in solid state are displayed in Figs. 3 and 4 . The electronic absorption and fluorescence emission wavelengths of dye 3 in different solvents are listed in Table 2 . In solution, the absorption spectra of 3 show two prominent vibronically structured absorption bands consisting of relatively sharp ones at low energy region 400–550 nm similar to the characteristic absorption bands of perylene dyes [5–8], and at high energy region around 360 nm with several weak absorption features up to 431 nm as the amine contribution (see the inset of Fig. 3(a)). The former bands can be assigned to characteristic π−π* transition of perylene dyes (DMF; 528, 491, and 463 nm) and the latter high energy weak bands (DMF; 433, 369 nm) are mainly contribution of amine. Notably, a third vibronically structured and broad absorption band is noticed in the range 600–800 nm in the polar aprotic and strongly electron donating solvents such as NMP, DMAC and DMF (NMP; 703, 681 nm, Fig. 3 and Table 2). Expectedly, the peak intensities of these bands increase in parallel to the electron donating ability of solvents. Therefore, these peaks cannot be observed for DMF in the overlapped absorption spectra of 3 (Fig. 3(a)). The band at around 700 nm is indicating the higher influence of solvent polarity and suggesting the existence of solvent dependent aggregation behavior [25]. As it can be readily seen from Fig. 3(a) and Table 2, the absorption maxima (λ max) show minimal dependence on the polarity of the electron donating solvents. Whereas the fluorescence spectra show a stronger red-shift in dipolar aprotic solvents (Fig. 3(b) and Table 2: Stokes shift: 1000000, 1111111, 769231 cm−1 (TCE, DCM, MeOH); 476190, 526316, 588235, 500000 cm−1 (NMP, DMAC, DMF, DMSO)). The emission maximum in non-polar TCE appears at 541 nm and in dipolar aprotic solvent DMSO at 551 nm. This clearly indicates that the emission spectra are more sensitive to the polarity of the solvents compared to absorption spectra. Consequently, a larger charge transfer is taking place in the excited state in comparison to the ground state and the excited state has larger dipole moment than ground state. Notably, an excimer kind emission is observed in the emission spectrum of 5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide (see the inset of Fig. 3(b), in NMP, 5 × 10−5 M, λ exc=310 nm, emission range: 300–800 nm). Interestingly, a solvent dependent aggregation band is observed in strong electron donating solvents (NMP, DMAC and DMF), whereas the situation becomes inverted in nonpolar and polar protic solvents. Consequently, aggregation process can be controlled by altering the solvent used. The molar absorption coefficients at the maximum absorption wavelengths (λ max) were obtained by recording the absorbance values of five different solutions in different concentrations. The slope of plots of the absorbance versus concentration in NMP, DMAC, DMF, and DMSO solvents gives the molar absorption coefficient (ε max) of 3 at the maximum absorption wavelengths (λ max) (Table 3 ). The molar absorption coefficients in NMP and DMAC appear to be intrinsically smaller than those in DMF and DMSO probably due to the solvent dependent aggregation behavior (DMF: 101325, DMSO: 84315, NMP: 50583 and DMAC: 74693 L mol−1 cm−1) (Fig. 3) [5–7,21–23]. Similarly, the molar absorption coefficients of 2 in NMP and DMAC were determined as 10500 and 8500 mol−1dm3cm−1, respectively (Table 3). The UV–Visible absorption spectra also explain the aggregation properties of 3 in solutions and solid state [5–7]. In all of the solution spectra, the changes in the absorption ratio between 0 → 0 and 0 → 1 transitions indicate the existence of monomeric perylene dye (3) molecules in solutions probably due to the low stability of the molecular self-assembly based on nonplanar structure of the diimide 3 (Scheme 2, Fig. 3(a) and Table S1). As depicted in Figs. 3 and 4 and Table S1, the A0→0/A0→1 ratios for solid state is 1.20, which shows that it is weakly aggregated even in solid state as opposing the optical characteristics of perylene dyes [5–7,21–23]. The weak aggregation in solid state has also been confirmed by three broader, red shifted and clearly resolved absorption bands as observed in solution-absorption spectra (Fig. 4 ) [5–7]. Importantly, the excitation of 3 in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 400 nm would be possible due to the enlarged absorption toward the short wavelength range. To gain further insight into the optical properties, concentration dependence of the electronic absorption and emission spectra at two different excitation wavelengths (indirect excitation; λ exc=315, direct excitation λ exc=485 nm) of 3 in DMF, NMP and DMAC was investigated (Fig. 5 and Fig. S1, Table 4 and Table. S2). The absorption maxima (λ max) show minimal dependence on the concentration change due to the absence of strong aggregation whereas distinct absorption curves have been reported for the perylene dyes at different concentrations [6]. This result indicates that 3 exists mainly as monomeric dye molecules in all these solvents at the concentration range between 10−6 to 10−5 M. Interestingly, the shape of the emission bands and the emission maxima at two different excitation wavelengths λ exc=315 and 485 nm depend strongly on the solvent used (Fig. 5 and Fig. S1, Table. 4 and Table. S2). Fig. 5 (a–c) and Table 4 show the changes in absorption (a) and emission spectra of 3 (b; direct excitation at λ exc=485, c; indirect excitation at λ exc=315 nm) in different concentrations from 1 × 10−6 to 2 × 10−5 M in DMF. As the concentration of 3 increases both the absorption and emission intensities increase when the excitation was performed at 485 nm (Fig. 5(a) and (b)). On the other hand, upon excitation at 315 nm, two weak and structureless emission bands around 364 and 700 nm can be seen on the emission spectrum shown in Fig. 5(c) beside the characteristic emission bands for perylene diimide (in the spectral range 500–650 nm). Here, it is important to note that at high concentration, the excimer like emissions were strongly quenched (364 and 700 nm) whereas the emission intensity of the perylene core remarkably increases, which is probably caused by photoinduced intramolecular energy transfer from 2 to 3 (Fig. 5(c)). As shown in Fig. 5(c) the emission of perylene core is sensitized by energy transfer from the moieties 2 at the imide positions of 3. Notably, the shape of the emission bands and the emission maxima observed in Fig. 5(a–f) depend strongly on the solvent used. As can be seen in Fig. 5(e) and f, the excitation was performed at either 485 nm or 315 nm which results exclusively in an emission with bands at 549, 583 and 639 nm (direct excitation of perylene diimide) and 425, 549 and 583(indirect excitation of perylene diimide) nm in NMP, respectively. It is important to note that a negligible or weak fluorescence of 2 around 400 nm is detectable for 3 in NMP upon excitation at 315 nm due to the strong absorption and emission characteristics of perylene core. These results are attributed to an intramolecular energy and/or electron transfer processes from 2 to 3 in NMP. Additionally, the absorbance and fluorescence properties of 3 in DMAC are quite similar to those in DMF (Fig. S1 and Table S2). In fact, 3 has shown different colors under daylight and a UV lamp (365 nm) in different solvents as shown in the optical photographs in Fig. 5 (DMF: (a) and (c)) and (NMP: (d) and (f)). In DMF, 3 exhibits bright orange-red color under daylight and emits strong fluorescence yellow color under UV excitation (365 nm) while getting more intense as the concentration increases (insets in Fig. 5(a) and (c)). The concentration dependent colors of 3 in DMAC under daylight and under UV excitation (365 nm) are very similar to those in DMF solvent. It emits light in strong fluorescence yellow color and becoming more intense as concentration increases under UV excitation (Fig. S1). More importantly, perylene dye 3 shows significant differences in colors under daylight and UV excitation with 365 nm in NMP (insets in Fig. 5(d) and (f)). It exhibits bright Bordeaux-brown color under daylight while getting more intense as the concentration increases. Interestingly, it emits glowing fluorescence pink, yellow and orange colors under UV excitation as concentration increases. Obviously, 3 in various electron donating polar aprotic solvents exhibits more pronounced solvatochromic behavior. Most interestingly, 3 shows a pronounced color change from bright orange-red to bright Bordeaux that can easily be followed by the naked eye (Fig. 5). The tunable emission color from fluorescent yellow to fluorescent orange-red with the increase of concentration is attributed photoinduced intramolecular energy transfer from 2 at the imide positions to perylene core. The fluorescence quantum yields (Ф f) are listed in Table 5 . Relatively, low fluorescence quantum yields (at λ exc=485 nm) are obtained for 3 in all the solvents used (TCE, DCM, NMP, MeOH, DMF, DMAC and DMSO). There are many reasons for the low fluorescence quantum yield result. One of the main reasons is the non-planarity of the chromophore, which creates efficient pathways for non-radiative decay (Scheme 2). Moreover, the reason for the low fluorescence quantum yield in TCE and DCM is due to poor solubility (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 3). The lowest fluorescence quantum yield is observed in MeOH and DMSO (Ф f=0.1, Table 5). It is important to note that, the efficient fluorescence quenching of the sulfur in DMSO solvent causes consistently the lowest fluorescence quantum yield for all perylene dyes (Table 5, Ф f=0.1) [5–7]. On the other hand, the dramatic quenching in MeOH is attributed to the protonation of the amide nitrogen. Importantly, the fluorescent quantum yields decreased deeply in electron donating polar solvents DMAC and NMP also. We attribute this rapid fluorescence quenching due to the photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron-donating unit 2 to the electron-accepting perylene diimide core (Ф f (DMAC)=0.25 and Ф f (NMP)=0.30). Optical parameters such as maximum absorption wavelength (λ max), molar absorption coefficient (ε max), oscillator strength f, fluorescence quantum yield (Ф f), theoretical radiative lifetime (τ 0, ns), fluorescence lifetime (τ f, ns), fluorescence rate constant (k f), rate constant of radiationless deactivation (k d ) and singlet energy (E s, kcal mol−1) data of 3 and amine (2) in DMF and NMP are given in Table 6 , respectively. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured in argon saturated solutions. The theoretical radiative lifetimes τ 0 were calculated according to the formula: τ 0=3.5 × 108/(ν 2 max ε max Δν 1/2), where ν max stands for the wavenumber in cm−1, ε max for the molar absorption coefficient at the selected absorption wavelength and Δν 1/2 indicates the half-width of the selected absorption in units of cm−1 [25]. Fluorescence lifetimes were calculated from τ f=τ 0 × Φ f and the rates of fluorescence from k f=1/τ0 (Table 6) [24,25]. The radiationless deactivations rate constant were calculated from k d=(k f/Φ f) – k f and oscillator strength from f=4.32 × 10−9Δν 1/2 ε max [25].
3.3 Electrochemical properties Electrochemistry of perylene dye 3 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in both solution (DMF, DMAC, NMP; supporting electrolyte: 0.1 M NaBF4) and solid-state (supporting electrolyte: 1 M HCl). The results are summarized in Fig. 6 . All the electrochemical measurements were repeated with multiple cycles to confirm the reproducibility of the redox waves and all the data were tabulated in Table 7 . The reduction potentials obtained for 3 in solution and solid-state with respect to Ag/AgCl are standardized with the reference, ferrocene and ferrocenium couple (Fc/Fc+). The CVs of 3 in DMF (Fig. 6(a)) show two one-electron reversible reduction waves with E 1/2,red1=−0.734 V and E 1/2,red2=−0.951 V (vs. Fc/Fc+ couple at a scan rate of 100 mVs−1, inset of Fig. 6(a)) in the cathodic region with peak potential separations (ΔE p) of 88 and 108 mV, respectively. The two one-electron reversible reduction waves infer the successive generation of the radical anion (dye 3 –•) and dianion (dye 3 −2). However, the reduction waves are poorly resolved at higher scan rates (Fig. 6(a)). The result is in excellent agreement with our previously reported perylene dyes [5–7,19–21]. The cyclic voltammograms of 3 in polar solvents NMP and DMAC from Fig. S4 also show two reversible, one-electron reductions. In NMP, the peak potentials are noticed at −0.791 V and −1.022 V (Fig. S2a; scan rate: 100 mVs−1, vs. Fc/Fc+) with peak potential separations ΔE p1=91 and ΔE p2=91 mV, respectively. The two reversible, one-electron reduction waves infer the successive generation of the radical anion and dianion. Notably, the reduction waves are highly resolved even at higher scan rates (Fig. S2(a)). Similar behavior was noticed for 3 in DMAC. As can be seen from Fig. S2(b), the CVs of 3 in DMAc also show two, one-electron reversible reduction waves at all scan rates in the range 100–2000 mVs−1. At a scan rate of 100 mVs−1, 3 exhibits E 1/2,red1=−0.779 V and E 1/2,red2=−1.015 V (vs. Fc/Fc+ couple) in the cathodic region with peak potential separations (ΔE p) of 87 and 94 mV, respectively. The reduction waves are highly resolved even at higher scan rates. In order to explore the impact of molecular interactions in solid state arising due to the presence of both electron donating and withdrawing groups on the imide structure, dye 3 was investigated very carefully in solid state. The solid state CVs of 3 are presented in Fig. 6(b). Dye 3 demonstrates only one reversible reduction wave between −1.00 to 1.00 V, implying the formation of dye 3 –• at −0.564 V (vs. Fc/Fc+, scan rate: 100 mVs−1, inset of Fig. 6(b)) with a peak potential separation ΔE p=446 mV (Table 7). Furthermore, two isopotential points noticed on the redox system of 3 at the cathodic region; the first at low coverages, at −0.320 V and the second at higher coverages, −0.050 V probably due to the profound charge transfer interactions in solid state. It is important to note that the isopotential points can be observed when the total current can be considered as a linear combination of two or more competitive processes. Conclusively, 3 exhibits high conductivity and electron accepting nature by generating a radical anion (dye 3 –•) in solid state (Fig. 6). The HOMO-LUMO energy differences for 3 were determined using optical methods (Fig. 7 ). In order to calculate the absolute energies of LUMO level of 3 with respect to the vacuum level, the redox data are standardized to the Fc/Fc+ couple which has a calculated absolute energy of −4.8 eV [25]. The optical HOMO−LUMO gap (E g) was calculated by UV–Visible spectroscopy, using the equation E g=1240/λ from the cut-off absorption wavelengths of the charge transfer bands (DMF; 780, DMAC; 760 and NMP; 765 nm) in visible and near infrared regions [25]. The calculated optical band gap (E g) energies of 3 are much lower when compared to those of perylene dyes most probably due to the charge transfer bands in NIR region (Table 7: Eg in DMF; 1.59, NMP; 1.62, DMAC; 1.63 and solid state; 1.93 eV) [5–7,19–21]. The diffusion coefficients (D) of 3 were estimated from the reduction potential data obtained from CV based on the Randles–Sevcik equation: i p=(2.69 × 105)n 3/2 ν 1/2 D 1/2AC, where i p is the peak current (A), n is the number of transferred electrons, ν is the scan rate (V s−1), D is the diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1), A is the electrode area (cm2), C is the concentration of the electroactive species (mol cm−3). The plots of peak current (i pc) vs. square root of scan rate (ν 1/2) give straight lines implying the diffusion controlled processes in DMF solution and in solid-state (Fig. S3 and Table S3). However, CV at the scan rate of 1000 mVs−1 was excluded from the calculation due to poor resolution. Accordingly, the diffusion coefficient values of 3 in solution (DMF) and the solid state are 1.07 × 10−8 cm2 s−1 and 1.88 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 with adjacent R 2 values of 0.92 and 0.99, respectively (Fig. S3 and Table S3). The higher diffusion coefficient in solid state infers the more stabilized and controlled diffusion processes.
3.4 Thermal stability The thermal properties of 3 are studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under nitrogen and thermogravimetric analysis under oxygen atmosphere, respectively (Fig. 8 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1). The DSC thermograms of TPDI shows no thermal transitions relating to the phase change up to 440 °C (Fig. 8(a)). Obviously, the amine moiety enhances the thermal stability of 3. The decomposition of 3 was initialized around 335 °C and 5% weight loss was recorded up to 440 °C (Fig. 8(b)). Comparatively, the main weight loss occurred between 440 and 650 °C. Importantly, the overall weight loss was only 50% of the original mass up to 955 °C, giving a 50% char yield. Dye 3, showed excellent thermal stability due to the amine units on the perylene core and particularly suited for high temperature applications.

Synthesis And Characterization:
The synthesis of the new perylene dye, 3 is outlined in Scheme 1 . The imidization proceeded mainly through the amine nitrogen as expected. It is noteworthy that the polycondensation was prevented by using a large excess of 5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide, 2. The structure of the compound 3 was characterized by 1HNMR, 13CNMR, MS, IR and elemental analysis; the results clearly support the predicted chemical structure of 3 (Scheme 1). Representative 3D molecular structures of 3 at different energy levels (all rendered using MarvinSketch by ChemAxon) show clearly the non-planarity (Scheme 2 ).
Table 1 lists the solubility of 3 in various organic solvents. One observes a high degree of solubility both in strong dipolar aprotic solvents, such as NMP, DMAC, DMF and DMSO, and in polar protic solvent such TFAc at room temperature. However, 3 is only partially soluble in nonpolar (TCE, CH2Cl2) and polar protic solvents (ETOH, MeOH) at 35 °C. The presence of cyano substituents sterically hinders the coplanar arrangement of the thiophene units with perylene core. Therefore, the short π-π contacts of fluorophores are prevented. Since the strong self-aggregation is hindered a high degree of solubility is observed in those organic solvents.

Photophysical Properties:
The electronic absorption and emission spectra (1 × 10−5 M, λ exc=485 nm) of 3 recorded in nonpolar, polar protic and aprotic solvents and in solid state are displayed in Figs. 3 and 4 . The electronic absorption and fluorescence emission wavelengths of dye 3 in different solvents are listed in Table 2 . In solution, the absorption spectra of 3 show two prominent vibronically structured absorption bands consisting of relatively sharp ones at low energy region 400–550 nm similar to the characteristic absorption bands of perylene dyes [5–8], and at high energy region around 360 nm with several weak absorption features up to 431 nm as the amine contribution (see the inset of Fig. 3(a)). The former bands can be assigned to characteristic π−π* transition of perylene dyes (DMF; 528, 491, and 463 nm) and the latter high energy weak bands (DMF; 433, 369 nm) are mainly contribution of amine. Notably, a third vibronically structured and broad absorption band is noticed in the range 600–800 nm in the polar aprotic and strongly electron donating solvents such as NMP, DMAC and DMF (NMP; 703, 681 nm, Fig. 3 and Table 2). Expectedly, the peak intensities of these bands increase in parallel to the electron donating ability of solvents. Therefore, these peaks cannot be observed for DMF in the overlapped absorption spectra of 3 (Fig. 3(a)). The band at around 700 nm is indicating the higher influence of solvent polarity and suggesting the existence of solvent dependent aggregation behavior [25]. As it can be readily seen from Fig. 3(a) and Table 2, the absorption maxima (λ max) show minimal dependence on the polarity of the electron donating solvents. Whereas the fluorescence spectra show a stronger red-shift in dipolar aprotic solvents (Fig. 3(b) and Table 2: Stokes shift: 1000000, 1111111, 769231 cm−1 (TCE, DCM, MeOH); 476190, 526316, 588235, 500000 cm−1 (NMP, DMAC, DMF, DMSO)). The emission maximum in non-polar TCE appears at 541 nm and in dipolar aprotic solvent DMSO at 551 nm. This clearly indicates that the emission spectra are more sensitive to the polarity of the solvents compared to absorption spectra. Consequently, a larger charge transfer is taking place in the excited state in comparison to the ground state and the excited state has larger dipole moment than ground state. Notably, an excimer kind emission is observed in the emission spectrum of 5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide (see the inset of Fig. 3(b), in NMP, 5 × 10−5 M, λ exc=310 nm, emission range: 300–800 nm). Interestingly, a solvent dependent aggregation band is observed in strong electron donating solvents (NMP, DMAC and DMF), whereas the situation becomes inverted in nonpolar and polar protic solvents. Consequently, aggregation process can be controlled by altering the solvent used.
The molar absorption coefficients at the maximum absorption wavelengths (λ max) were obtained by recording the absorbance values of five different solutions in different concentrations. The slope of plots of the absorbance versus concentration in NMP, DMAC, DMF, and DMSO solvents gives the molar absorption coefficient (ε max) of 3 at the maximum absorption wavelengths (λ max) (Table 3 ). The molar absorption coefficients in NMP and DMAC appear to be intrinsically smaller than those in DMF and DMSO probably due to the solvent dependent aggregation behavior (DMF: 101325, DMSO: 84315, NMP: 50583 and DMAC: 74693 L mol−1 cm−1) (Fig. 3) [5–7,21–23]. Similarly, the molar absorption coefficients of 2 in NMP and DMAC were determined as 10500 and 8500 mol−1dm3cm−1, respectively (Table 3).
The UV–Visible absorption spectra also explain the aggregation properties of 3 in solutions and solid state [5–7]. In all of the solution spectra, the changes in the absorption ratio between 0 → 0 and 0 → 1 transitions indicate the existence of monomeric perylene dye (3) molecules in solutions probably due to the low stability of the molecular self-assembly based on nonplanar structure of the diimide 3 (Scheme 2, Fig. 3(a) and Table S1). As depicted in Figs. 3 and 4 and Table S1, the A0→0/A0→1 ratios for solid state is 1.20, which shows that it is weakly aggregated even in solid state as opposing the optical characteristics of perylene dyes [5–7,21–23]. The weak aggregation in solid state has also been confirmed by three broader, red shifted and clearly resolved absorption bands as observed in solution-absorption spectra (Fig. 4 ) [5–7].
Importantly, the excitation of 3 in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 400 nm would be possible due to the enlarged absorption toward the short wavelength range. To gain further insight into the optical properties, concentration dependence of the electronic absorption and emission spectra at two different excitation wavelengths (indirect excitation; λ exc=315, direct excitation λ exc=485 nm) of 3 in DMF, NMP and DMAC was investigated (Fig. 5 and Fig. S1, Table 4 and Table. S2). The absorption maxima (λ max) show minimal dependence on the concentration change due to the absence of strong aggregation whereas distinct absorption curves have been reported for the perylene dyes at different concentrations [6]. This result indicates that 3 exists mainly as monomeric dye molecules in all these solvents at the concentration range between 10−6 to 10−5 M. Interestingly, the shape of the emission bands and the emission maxima at two different excitation wavelengths λ exc=315 and 485 nm depend strongly on the solvent used (Fig. 5 and Fig. S1, Table. 4 and Table. S2).
Fig. 5 (a–c) and Table 4 show the changes in absorption (a) and emission spectra of 3 (b; direct excitation at λ exc=485, c; indirect excitation at λ exc=315 nm) in different concentrations from 1 × 10−6 to 2 × 10−5 M in DMF. As the concentration of 3 increases both the absorption and emission intensities increase when the excitation was performed at 485 nm (Fig. 5(a) and (b)). On the other hand, upon excitation at 315 nm, two weak and structureless emission bands around 364 and 700 nm can be seen on the emission spectrum shown in Fig. 5(c) beside the characteristic emission bands for perylene diimide (in the spectral range 500–650 nm). Here, it is important to note that at high concentration, the excimer like emissions were strongly quenched (364 and 700 nm) whereas the emission intensity of the perylene core remarkably increases, which is probably caused by photoinduced intramolecular energy transfer from 2 to 3 (Fig. 5(c)). As shown in Fig. 5(c) the emission of perylene core is sensitized by energy transfer from the moieties 2 at the imide positions of 3. Notably, the shape of the emission bands and the emission maxima observed in Fig. 5(a–f) depend strongly on the solvent used.
As can be seen in Fig. 5(e) and f, the excitation was performed at either 485 nm or 315 nm which results exclusively in an emission with bands at 549, 583 and 639 nm (direct excitation of perylene diimide) and 425, 549 and 583(indirect excitation of perylene diimide) nm in NMP, respectively. It is important to note that a negligible or weak fluorescence of 2 around 400 nm is detectable for 3 in NMP upon excitation at 315 nm due to the strong absorption and emission characteristics of perylene core. These results are attributed to an intramolecular energy and/or electron transfer processes from 2 to 3 in NMP. Additionally, the absorbance and fluorescence properties of 3 in DMAC are quite similar to those in DMF (Fig. S1 and Table S2).
In fact, 3 has shown different colors under daylight and a UV lamp (365 nm) in different solvents as shown in the optical photographs in Fig. 5 (DMF: (a) and (c)) and (NMP: (d) and (f)). In DMF, 3 exhibits bright orange-red color under daylight and emits strong fluorescence yellow color under UV excitation (365 nm) while getting more intense as the concentration increases (insets in Fig. 5(a) and (c)). The concentration dependent colors of 3 in DMAC under daylight and under UV excitation (365 nm) are very similar to those in DMF solvent. It emits light in strong fluorescence yellow color and becoming more intense as concentration increases under UV excitation (Fig. S1). More importantly, perylene dye 3 shows significant differences in colors under daylight and UV excitation with 365 nm in NMP (insets in Fig. 5(d) and (f)). It exhibits bright Bordeaux-brown color under daylight while getting more intense as the concentration increases. Interestingly, it emits glowing fluorescence pink, yellow and orange colors under UV excitation as concentration increases. Obviously, 3 in various electron donating polar aprotic solvents exhibits more pronounced solvatochromic behavior. Most interestingly, 3 shows a pronounced color change from bright orange-red to bright Bordeaux that can easily be followed by the naked eye (Fig. 5). The tunable emission color from fluorescent yellow to fluorescent orange-red with the increase of concentration is attributed photoinduced intramolecular energy transfer from 2 at the imide positions to perylene core.
The fluorescence quantum yields (Ф f) are listed in Table 5 . Relatively, low fluorescence quantum yields (at λ exc=485 nm) are obtained for 3 in all the solvents used (TCE, DCM, NMP, MeOH, DMF, DMAC and DMSO). There are many reasons for the low fluorescence quantum yield result. One of the main reasons is the non-planarity of the chromophore, which creates efficient pathways for non-radiative decay (Scheme 2). Moreover, the reason for the low fluorescence quantum yield in TCE and DCM is due to poor solubility (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 3). The lowest fluorescence quantum yield is observed in MeOH and DMSO (Ф f=0.1, Table 5). It is important to note that, the efficient fluorescence quenching of the sulfur in DMSO solvent causes consistently the lowest fluorescence quantum yield for all perylene dyes (Table 5, Ф f=0.1) [5–7]. On the other hand, the dramatic quenching in MeOH is attributed to the protonation of the amide nitrogen. Importantly, the fluorescent quantum yields decreased deeply in electron donating polar solvents DMAC and NMP also. We attribute this rapid fluorescence quenching due to the photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron-donating unit 2 to the electron-accepting perylene diimide core (Ф f (DMAC)=0.25 and Ф f (NMP)=0.30).
Optical parameters such as maximum absorption wavelength (λ max), molar absorption coefficient (ε max), oscillator strength f, fluorescence quantum yield (Ф f), theoretical radiative lifetime (τ 0, ns), fluorescence lifetime (τ f, ns), fluorescence rate constant (k f), rate constant of radiationless deactivation (k d ) and singlet energy (E s, kcal mol−1) data of 3 and amine (2) in DMF and NMP are given in Table 6 , respectively. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured in argon saturated solutions. The theoretical radiative lifetimes τ 0 were calculated according to the formula: τ 0=3.5 × 108/(ν 2 max ε max Δν 1/2), where ν max stands for the wavenumber in cm−1, ε max for the molar absorption coefficient at the selected absorption wavelength and Δν 1/2 indicates the half-width of the selected absorption in units of cm−1 [25]. Fluorescence lifetimes were calculated from τ f=τ 0 × Φ f and the rates of fluorescence from k f=1/τ0 (Table 6) [24,25]. The radiationless deactivations rate constant were calculated from k d=(k f/Φ f) – k f and oscillator strength from f=4.32 × 10−9Δν 1/2 ε max [25].

Electrochemical Properties:
Electrochemistry of perylene dye 3 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in both solution (DMF, DMAC, NMP; supporting electrolyte: 0.1 M NaBF4) and solid-state (supporting electrolyte: 1 M HCl). The results are summarized in Fig. 6 . All the electrochemical measurements were repeated with multiple cycles to confirm the reproducibility of the redox waves and all the data were tabulated in Table 7 . The reduction potentials obtained for 3 in solution and solid-state with respect to Ag/AgCl are standardized with the reference, ferrocene and ferrocenium couple (Fc/Fc+).
The CVs of 3 in DMF (Fig. 6(a)) show two one-electron reversible reduction waves with E 1/2,red1=−0.734 V and E 1/2,red2=−0.951 V (vs. Fc/Fc+ couple at a scan rate of 100 mVs−1, inset of Fig. 6(a)) in the cathodic region with peak potential separations (ΔE p) of 88 and 108 mV, respectively. The two one-electron reversible reduction waves infer the successive generation of the radical anion (dye 3 –•) and dianion (dye 3 −2). However, the reduction waves are poorly resolved at higher scan rates (Fig. 6(a)). The result is in excellent agreement with our previously reported perylene dyes [5–7,19–21].
The cyclic voltammograms of 3 in polar solvents NMP and DMAC from Fig. S4 also show two reversible, one-electron reductions. In NMP, the peak potentials are noticed at −0.791 V and −1.022 V (Fig. S2a; scan rate: 100 mVs−1, vs. Fc/Fc+) with peak potential separations ΔE p1=91 and ΔE p2=91 mV, respectively. The two reversible, one-electron reduction waves infer the successive generation of the radical anion and dianion. Notably, the reduction waves are highly resolved even at higher scan rates (Fig. S2(a)). Similar behavior was noticed for 3 in DMAC. As can be seen from Fig. S2(b), the CVs of 3 in DMAc also show two, one-electron reversible reduction waves at all scan rates in the range 100–2000 mVs−1. At a scan rate of 100 mVs−1, 3 exhibits E 1/2,red1=−0.779 V and E 1/2,red2=−1.015 V (vs. Fc/Fc+ couple) in the cathodic region with peak potential separations (ΔE p) of 87 and 94 mV, respectively. The reduction waves are highly resolved even at higher scan rates.
In order to explore the impact of molecular interactions in solid state arising due to the presence of both electron donating and withdrawing groups on the imide structure, dye 3 was investigated very carefully in solid state. The solid state CVs of 3 are presented in Fig. 6(b). Dye 3 demonstrates only one reversible reduction wave between −1.00 to 1.00 V, implying the formation of dye 3 –• at −0.564 V (vs. Fc/Fc+, scan rate: 100 mVs−1, inset of Fig. 6(b)) with a peak potential separation ΔE p=446 mV (Table 7). Furthermore, two isopotential points noticed on the redox system of 3 at the cathodic region; the first at low coverages, at −0.320 V and the second at higher coverages, −0.050 V probably due to the profound charge transfer interactions in solid state. It is important to note that the isopotential points can be observed when the total current can be considered as a linear combination of two or more competitive processes. Conclusively, 3 exhibits high conductivity and electron accepting nature by generating a radical anion (dye 3 –•) in solid state (Fig. 6).
The HOMO-LUMO energy differences for 3 were determined using optical methods (Fig. 7 ). In order to calculate the absolute energies of LUMO level of 3 with respect to the vacuum level, the redox data are standardized to the Fc/Fc+ couple which has a calculated absolute energy of −4.8 eV [25]. The optical HOMO−LUMO gap (E g) was calculated by UV–Visible spectroscopy, using the equation E g=1240/λ from the cut-off absorption wavelengths of the charge transfer bands (DMF; 780, DMAC; 760 and NMP; 765 nm) in visible and near infrared regions [25].
The calculated optical band gap (E g) energies of 3 are much lower when compared to those of perylene dyes most probably due to the charge transfer bands in NIR region (Table 7: Eg in DMF; 1.59, NMP; 1.62, DMAC; 1.63 and solid state; 1.93 eV) [5–7,19–21].
The diffusion coefficients (D) of 3 were estimated from the reduction potential data obtained from CV based on the Randles–Sevcik equation: i p=(2.69 × 105)n 3/2 ν 1/2 D 1/2AC, where i p is the peak current (A), n is the number of transferred electrons, ν is the scan rate (V s−1), D is the diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1), A is the electrode area (cm2), C is the concentration of the electroactive species (mol cm−3). The plots of peak current (i pc) vs. square root of scan rate (ν 1/2) give straight lines implying the diffusion controlled processes in DMF solution and in solid-state (Fig. S3 and Table S3). However, CV at the scan rate of 1000 mVs−1 was excluded from the calculation due to poor resolution. Accordingly, the diffusion coefficient values of 3 in solution (DMF) and the solid state are 1.07 × 10−8 cm2 s−1 and 1.88 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 with adjacent R 2 values of 0.92 and 0.99, respectively (Fig. S3 and Table S3). The higher diffusion coefficient in solid state infers the more stabilized and controlled diffusion processes.

Thermal Stability:
The thermal properties of 3 are studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under nitrogen and thermogravimetric analysis under oxygen atmosphere, respectively (Fig. 8 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1). The DSC thermograms of TPDI shows no thermal transitions relating to the phase change up to 440 °C (Fig. 8(a)). Obviously, the amine moiety enhances the thermal stability of 3. The decomposition of 3 was initialized around 335 °C and 5% weight loss was recorded up to 440 °C (Fig. 8(b)). Comparatively, the main weight loss occurred between 440 and 650 °C. Importantly, the overall weight loss was only 50% of the original mass up to 955 °C, giving a 50% char yield. Dye 3, showed excellent thermal stability due to the amine units on the perylene core and particularly suited for high temperature applications.

Conclusions:
In this work, we have successfully synthesized a new non-planar low bandgap perylene diimide, 3 with a high solubility, strong electron accepting ability and controllable conductivity.
In the polar aprotic and strongly electron donating solvents such as DMF, DMAC and NMP the compound has intense absorption in the visible spectrum in the wavelength range 300–800 nm. Upon excitation at 315 nm, two weak and structureless charge emission bands around 364 and 700 nm obtained. Importantly the emission of these charge transfer bands were strongly quenched whereas the emission intensity of the perylene core remarkably increases as the solution concentration increases, which is explained by photoinduced intramolecular energy transfer from 2 to 3. However, the nonplanar geometry of 3 prevented efficient energy transfer between donor and acceptor.
Pronounced solvatochromic behavior is observed in strong electron donating solvents such as NMP which is a characteristic of donor-acceptor molecules to change color. Dye 3 behaves differently in different organic solvents. In strong electron donating solvents (DMF, DMAC and NMP) charge-transfer band is observed, whereas the situation becomes inverted in nonpolar solvents. Importantly, charge transfer process can be controlled by altering the solvent used in dissolving 3.
In summary, the overall results reveal that the conjugated low band gap compound 3 is a promising candidate for high performance photonics, sensors and light harvesting systems with its tunable photophysical and electrochemical properties.

Body:
Development of novel materials with optimal structural properties, thermal, photochemical and electrochemical stabilities plays an important role in the research for a sustainable energy future. Thiophenes and perylenes substituted donor−acceptor architectures have been extensively investigated as the most promising class of materials in energy transfer and light−harvesting systems for photovoltaic devices [1–4]. Perylene dyes are particularly important compounds due to their stupendous absorption and emission in the spectral region from visible to near infrared (NIR), photochemical and electrochemical properties, and thermal, chemical and photochemical stabilities [1–7]. The problems such as poor solubility and high tendency to aggregate in solutions can be solved using different synthetic strategies [5–8]. Thiophenes are well known class of donor materials with their low band gap features, excellent charge transport properties and stabilities [9–12]. Charge transfer interactions in hydrogen bonded donor/acceptor systems, ambipolar field−effect transistors, different molecular architectures (acceptor−donor, acceptor−donor−acceptor and donor−acceptor−donor), and alternating copolysiloxane with terthiophene donor/perylendiimide acceptor systems have been investigated and reported [9–12]. Highly stable and soluble bay−substituted thiophenes/perylenediimide donor−acceptor systems with low band gap have shown tunable charge−transport properties [13–18]. Moreover, the disappearance of charge−transfer absorption band of bay−substituted green color perylene dyes has been explained via protonation which can be challenging for color-tunable products technologies [18]. On the other hand, perylene polymers have attracted considerable interest with their strong absorption and fluorescence, electrochemical and photochemical properties, and excellent stabilities. However, special synthetic techniques are needed for these polymers in order to overcome the poor solubility and aggregation limitations [19–24].

For the purpose of achieving broad and intense absorption and improved light harvesting properties, specifically, thiophenes were chosen in the donor−π bridge−acceptor−π bridge−donor polymers and low molecular weight materials as electron−donating units since they are known to be one of the most powerful organic electron donors (OED) [9–12].

In our work reported here, unlike the common donor−π bridge−acceptor−π bridge−donor structures with high molecular weights, a mimic of donor−acceptor−donor architecture was designed by using a multisubstituted thiophene (5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide) and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride. More specifically, we were interested in investigating low molecular weight donor−acceptor−donor system material with low bandgap, high solubility and strong electron donating/accepting ability with controllable conductivity. The band gap energy of such models can be reduced by raising the HOMO energy level selectively via powerful electron donors [1–4].

When designing the system, we considered the following important characteristics: i) The amine, 5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide (2) has three different substituents which can hinder molecular packing and increase solubility, ii) the two different electron-withdrawing substituents (cyano and amide) present in amine unit can lead to high electron affinity, iii) controllable, high electron conjugation within the molecule can extend the absorption to near infrared region for developing novel low band gap materials for photonic technology, iv) the hydrogen bonding ability of cyano substituent may control the conductivity of molecule, v) the two units, 5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide and perylenediimide, do not absorb in the same spectral regions but the fluorescence of amine overlaps well with the absorption of perylenediimide, which makes the couple adequate to achieve effective light harvesting and photoinduced electron transfer. Photophysical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized architecture in solution and solid state are investigated in detail.

Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (1), 5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide (2), zinc acetate, isoquinoline and m-cresol were obtained from Aldrich. Isoquinoline and m-cresol were dried over activate 4 Å molecular sieves and distilled freshly prior to use. Sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF4) and ferrocene were purchased from Fluka and used as received. The solvents for spectroscopic studies were of spectroscopic grade.

FTIR spectra were recorded on Mattson (USA) satellite FT-IR spectrophotometer from KBr pellets. Mass spectral data were recorded on Finnigan MAT 311A instrument and the data were represented in m/z (%) values. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on 400 MHz Bruker spectrophotometer, respectively using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) and deuterated trifluoroacetic acid (CF3CO2D). UV–Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian-Cary 100 spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectra on a Varian-Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer. Elemental analyses were measured on a Carlo Erba-1106 (C, H, and N) elemental analyzer. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) thermograms were obtained on Perkin Elmer/DSC/Jade DSC under nitrogen atmosphere and Perkin Elmer/TGA/Pyris 1 under oxygen, respectively, with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. All electrochemical measurements in solution and solid-state were performed on Gamry instruments workstation equipped with a PC computer monitoring Reference 600 Potensiostat/Galvanostat/ZRA system. Redox data from cyclic (CV) and square-wave voltammetry (SWV) measurements were obtained using a three-electrode system throughout the work, which are working-glassy carbon, counter-platinum wire, and reference-Ag/AgCl electrodes. The glassy carbon electrode was polished carefully with 0.05 μm alumina slurry to a mirror finish prior to use. The supporting electrolyte (0.1 M NaBF4 in dimethyl formamide (DMF)) solution was measured first to produce a blank surface and added the 3 (1.2 × 10−4 M) to measure their redox potentials with an internal reference ferrocene.

The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and poured into 100 mL cold methanol. The precipitated crude powder was filtered off, treated with methanol (MeOH) in a Soxhlet apparatus for 1 day in order to get rid of unreacted starting materials and high boiling solvents and recrystallized from N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAC) and dried under vacuum, giving dark purple solid particles.

The synthesis of the new perylene dye, 3 is outlined in Scheme 1 . The imidization proceeded mainly through the amine nitrogen as expected. It is noteworthy that the polycondensation was prevented by using a large excess of 5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide, 2. The structure of the compound 3 was characterized by 1HNMR, 13CNMR, MS, IR and elemental analysis; the results clearly support the predicted chemical structure of 3 (Scheme 1). Representative 3D molecular structures of 3 at different energy levels (all rendered using MarvinSketch by ChemAxon) show clearly the non-planarity (Scheme 2 ).

Table 1 lists the solubility of 3 in various organic solvents. One observes a high degree of solubility both in strong dipolar aprotic solvents, such as NMP, DMAC, DMF and DMSO, and in polar protic solvent such TFAc at room temperature. However, 3 is only partially soluble in nonpolar (TCE, CH2Cl2) and polar protic solvents (ETOH, MeOH) at 35 °C. The presence of cyano substituents sterically hinders the coplanar arrangement of the thiophene units with perylene core. Therefore, the short π-π contacts of fluorophores are prevented. Since the strong self-aggregation is hindered a high degree of solubility is observed in those organic solvents.

The electronic absorption and emission spectra (1 × 10−5 M, λ exc=485 nm) of 3 recorded in nonpolar, polar protic and aprotic solvents and in solid state are displayed in Figs. 3 and 4 . The electronic absorption and fluorescence emission wavelengths of dye 3 in different solvents are listed in Table 2 . In solution, the absorption spectra of 3 show two prominent vibronically structured absorption bands consisting of relatively sharp ones at low energy region 400–550 nm similar to the characteristic absorption bands of perylene dyes [5–8], and at high energy region around 360 nm with several weak absorption features up to 431 nm as the amine contribution (see the inset of Fig. 3(a)). The former bands can be assigned to characteristic π−π* transition of perylene dyes (DMF; 528, 491, and 463 nm) and the latter high energy weak bands (DMF; 433, 369 nm) are mainly contribution of amine. Notably, a third vibronically structured and broad absorption band is noticed in the range 600–800 nm in the polar aprotic and strongly electron donating solvents such as NMP, DMAC and DMF (NMP; 703, 681 nm, Fig. 3 and Table 2). Expectedly, the peak intensities of these bands increase in parallel to the electron donating ability of solvents. Therefore, these peaks cannot be observed for DMF in the overlapped absorption spectra of 3 (Fig. 3(a)). The band at around 700 nm is indicating the higher influence of solvent polarity and suggesting the existence of solvent dependent aggregation behavior [25]. As it can be readily seen from Fig. 3(a) and Table 2, the absorption maxima (λ max) show minimal dependence on the polarity of the electron donating solvents. Whereas the fluorescence spectra show a stronger red-shift in dipolar aprotic solvents (Fig. 3(b) and Table 2: Stokes shift: 1000000, 1111111, 769231 cm−1 (TCE, DCM, MeOH); 476190, 526316, 588235, 500000 cm−1 (NMP, DMAC, DMF, DMSO)). The emission maximum in non-polar TCE appears at 541 nm and in dipolar aprotic solvent DMSO at 551 nm. This clearly indicates that the emission spectra are more sensitive to the polarity of the solvents compared to absorption spectra. Consequently, a larger charge transfer is taking place in the excited state in comparison to the ground state and the excited state has larger dipole moment than ground state. Notably, an excimer kind emission is observed in the emission spectrum of 5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide (see the inset of Fig. 3(b), in NMP, 5 × 10−5 M, λ exc=310 nm, emission range: 300–800 nm). Interestingly, a solvent dependent aggregation band is observed in strong electron donating solvents (NMP, DMAC and DMF), whereas the situation becomes inverted in nonpolar and polar protic solvents. Consequently, aggregation process can be controlled by altering the solvent used.

The molar absorption coefficients at the maximum absorption wavelengths (λ max) were obtained by recording the absorbance values of five different solutions in different concentrations. The slope of plots of the absorbance versus concentration in NMP, DMAC, DMF, and DMSO solvents gives the molar absorption coefficient (ε max) of 3 at the maximum absorption wavelengths (λ max) (Table 3 ). The molar absorption coefficients in NMP and DMAC appear to be intrinsically smaller than those in DMF and DMSO probably due to the solvent dependent aggregation behavior (DMF: 101325, DMSO: 84315, NMP: 50583 and DMAC: 74693 L mol−1 cm−1) (Fig. 3) [5–7,21–23]. Similarly, the molar absorption coefficients of 2 in NMP and DMAC were determined as 10500 and 8500 mol−1dm3cm−1, respectively (Table 3).

The UV–Visible absorption spectra also explain the aggregation properties of 3 in solutions and solid state [5–7]. In all of the solution spectra, the changes in the absorption ratio between 0 → 0 and 0 → 1 transitions indicate the existence of monomeric perylene dye (3) molecules in solutions probably due to the low stability of the molecular self-assembly based on nonplanar structure of the diimide 3 (Scheme 2, Fig. 3(a) and Table S1). As depicted in Figs. 3 and 4 and Table S1, the A0→0/A0→1 ratios for solid state is 1.20, which shows that it is weakly aggregated even in solid state as opposing the optical characteristics of perylene dyes [5–7,21–23]. The weak aggregation in solid state has also been confirmed by three broader, red shifted and clearly resolved absorption bands as observed in solution-absorption spectra (Fig. 4 ) [5–7].

Importantly, the excitation of 3 in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 400 nm would be possible due to the enlarged absorption toward the short wavelength range. To gain further insight into the optical properties, concentration dependence of the electronic absorption and emission spectra at two different excitation wavelengths (indirect excitation; λ exc=315, direct excitation λ exc=485 nm) of 3 in DMF, NMP and DMAC was investigated (Fig. 5 and Fig. S1, Table 4 and Table. S2). The absorption maxima (λ max) show minimal dependence on the concentration change due to the absence of strong aggregation whereas distinct absorption curves have been reported for the perylene dyes at different concentrations [6]. This result indicates that 3 exists mainly as monomeric dye molecules in all these solvents at the concentration range between 10−6 to 10−5 M. Interestingly, the shape of the emission bands and the emission maxima at two different excitation wavelengths λ exc=315 and 485 nm depend strongly on the solvent used (Fig. 5 and Fig. S1, Table. 4 and Table. S2).

Fig. 5 (a–c) and Table 4 show the changes in absorption (a) and emission spectra of 3 (b; direct excitation at λ exc=485, c; indirect excitation at λ exc=315 nm) in different concentrations from 1 × 10−6 to 2 × 10−5 M in DMF. As the concentration of 3 increases both the absorption and emission intensities increase when the excitation was performed at 485 nm (Fig. 5(a) and (b)). On the other hand, upon excitation at 315 nm, two weak and structureless emission bands around 364 and 700 nm can be seen on the emission spectrum shown in Fig. 5(c) beside the characteristic emission bands for perylene diimide (in the spectral range 500–650 nm). Here, it is important to note that at high concentration, the excimer like emissions were strongly quenched (364 and 700 nm) whereas the emission intensity of the perylene core remarkably increases, which is probably caused by photoinduced intramolecular energy transfer from 2 to 3 (Fig. 5(c)). As shown in Fig. 5(c) the emission of perylene core is sensitized by energy transfer from the moieties 2 at the imide positions of 3. Notably, the shape of the emission bands and the emission maxima observed in Fig. 5(a–f) depend strongly on the solvent used.

As can be seen in Fig. 5(e) and f, the excitation was performed at either 485 nm or 315 nm which results exclusively in an emission with bands at 549, 583 and 639 nm (direct excitation of perylene diimide) and 425, 549 and 583(indirect excitation of perylene diimide) nm in NMP, respectively. It is important to note that a negligible or weak fluorescence of 2 around 400 nm is detectable for 3 in NMP upon excitation at 315 nm due to the strong absorption and emission characteristics of perylene core. These results are attributed to an intramolecular energy and/or electron transfer processes from 2 to 3 in NMP. Additionally, the absorbance and fluorescence properties of 3 in DMAC are quite similar to those in DMF (Fig. S1 and Table S2).

In fact, 3 has shown different colors under daylight and a UV lamp (365 nm) in different solvents as shown in the optical photographs in Fig. 5 (DMF: (a) and (c)) and (NMP: (d) and (f)). In DMF, 3 exhibits bright orange-red color under daylight and emits strong fluorescence yellow color under UV excitation (365 nm) while getting more intense as the concentration increases (insets in Fig. 5(a) and (c)). The concentration dependent colors of 3 in DMAC under daylight and under UV excitation (365 nm) are very similar to those in DMF solvent. It emits light in strong fluorescence yellow color and becoming more intense as concentration increases under UV excitation (Fig. S1). More importantly, perylene dye 3 shows significant differences in colors under daylight and UV excitation with 365 nm in NMP (insets in Fig. 5(d) and (f)). It exhibits bright Bordeaux-brown color under daylight while getting more intense as the concentration increases. Interestingly, it emits glowing fluorescence pink, yellow and orange colors under UV excitation as concentration increases. Obviously, 3 in various electron donating polar aprotic solvents exhibits more pronounced solvatochromic behavior. Most interestingly, 3 shows a pronounced color change from bright orange-red to bright Bordeaux that can easily be followed by the naked eye (Fig. 5). The tunable emission color from fluorescent yellow to fluorescent orange-red with the increase of concentration is attributed photoinduced intramolecular energy transfer from 2 at the imide positions to perylene core.

The fluorescence quantum yields (Ф f) are listed in Table 5 . Relatively, low fluorescence quantum yields (at λ exc=485 nm) are obtained for 3 in all the solvents used (TCE, DCM, NMP, MeOH, DMF, DMAC and DMSO). There are many reasons for the low fluorescence quantum yield result. One of the main reasons is the non-planarity of the chromophore, which creates efficient pathways for non-radiative decay (Scheme 2). Moreover, the reason for the low fluorescence quantum yield in TCE and DCM is due to poor solubility (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 3). The lowest fluorescence quantum yield is observed in MeOH and DMSO (Ф f=0.1, Table 5). It is important to note that, the efficient fluorescence quenching of the sulfur in DMSO solvent causes consistently the lowest fluorescence quantum yield for all perylene dyes (Table 5, Ф f=0.1) [5–7]. On the other hand, the dramatic quenching in MeOH is attributed to the protonation of the amide nitrogen. Importantly, the fluorescent quantum yields decreased deeply in electron donating polar solvents DMAC and NMP also. We attribute this rapid fluorescence quenching due to the photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron-donating unit 2 to the electron-accepting perylene diimide core (Ф f (DMAC)=0.25 and Ф f (NMP)=0.30).

Optical parameters such as maximum absorption wavelength (λ max), molar absorption coefficient (ε max), oscillator strength f, fluorescence quantum yield (Ф f), theoretical radiative lifetime (τ 0, ns), fluorescence lifetime (τ f, ns), fluorescence rate constant (k f), rate constant of radiationless deactivation (k d ) and singlet energy (E s, kcal mol−1) data of 3 and amine (2) in DMF and NMP are given in Table 6 , respectively. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured in argon saturated solutions. The theoretical radiative lifetimes τ 0 were calculated according to the formula: τ 0=3.5 × 108/(ν 2 max ε max Δν 1/2), where ν max stands for the wavenumber in cm−1, ε max for the molar absorption coefficient at the selected absorption wavelength and Δν 1/2 indicates the half-width of the selected absorption in units of cm−1 [25]. Fluorescence lifetimes were calculated from τ f=τ 0 × Φ f and the rates of fluorescence from k f=1/τ0 (Table 6) [24,25]. The radiationless deactivations rate constant were calculated from k d=(k f/Φ f) – k f and oscillator strength from f=4.32 × 10−9Δν 1/2 ε max [25].

Electrochemistry of perylene dye 3 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in both solution (DMF, DMAC, NMP; supporting electrolyte: 0.1 M NaBF4) and solid-state (supporting electrolyte: 1 M HCl). The results are summarized in Fig. 6 . All the electrochemical measurements were repeated with multiple cycles to confirm the reproducibility of the redox waves and all the data were tabulated in Table 7 . The reduction potentials obtained for 3 in solution and solid-state with respect to Ag/AgCl are standardized with the reference, ferrocene and ferrocenium couple (Fc/Fc+).

The CVs of 3 in DMF (Fig. 6(a)) show two one-electron reversible reduction waves with E 1/2,red1=−0.734 V and E 1/2,red2=−0.951 V (vs. Fc/Fc+ couple at a scan rate of 100 mVs−1, inset of Fig. 6(a)) in the cathodic region with peak potential separations (ΔE p) of 88 and 108 mV, respectively. The two one-electron reversible reduction waves infer the successive generation of the radical anion (dye 3 –•) and dianion (dye 3 −2). However, the reduction waves are poorly resolved at higher scan rates (Fig. 6(a)). The result is in excellent agreement with our previously reported perylene dyes [5–7,19–21].

The cyclic voltammograms of 3 in polar solvents NMP and DMAC from Fig. S4 also show two reversible, one-electron reductions. In NMP, the peak potentials are noticed at −0.791 V and −1.022 V (Fig. S2a; scan rate: 100 mVs−1, vs. Fc/Fc+) with peak potential separations ΔE p1=91 and ΔE p2=91 mV, respectively. The two reversible, one-electron reduction waves infer the successive generation of the radical anion and dianion. Notably, the reduction waves are highly resolved even at higher scan rates (Fig. S2(a)). Similar behavior was noticed for 3 in DMAC. As can be seen from Fig. S2(b), the CVs of 3 in DMAc also show two, one-electron reversible reduction waves at all scan rates in the range 100–2000 mVs−1. At a scan rate of 100 mVs−1, 3 exhibits E 1/2,red1=−0.779 V and E 1/2,red2=−1.015 V (vs. Fc/Fc+ couple) in the cathodic region with peak potential separations (ΔE p) of 87 and 94 mV, respectively. The reduction waves are highly resolved even at higher scan rates.

In order to explore the impact of molecular interactions in solid state arising due to the presence of both electron donating and withdrawing groups on the imide structure, dye 3 was investigated very carefully in solid state. The solid state CVs of 3 are presented in Fig. 6(b). Dye 3 demonstrates only one reversible reduction wave between −1.00 to 1.00 V, implying the formation of dye 3 –• at −0.564 V (vs. Fc/Fc+, scan rate: 100 mVs−1, inset of Fig. 6(b)) with a peak potential separation ΔE p=446 mV (Table 7). Furthermore, two isopotential points noticed on the redox system of 3 at the cathodic region; the first at low coverages, at −0.320 V and the second at higher coverages, −0.050 V probably due to the profound charge transfer interactions in solid state. It is important to note that the isopotential points can be observed when the total current can be considered as a linear combination of two or more competitive processes. Conclusively, 3 exhibits high conductivity and electron accepting nature by generating a radical anion (dye 3 –•) in solid state (Fig. 6).

The HOMO-LUMO energy differences for 3 were determined using optical methods (Fig. 7 ). In order to calculate the absolute energies of LUMO level of 3 with respect to the vacuum level, the redox data are standardized to the Fc/Fc+ couple which has a calculated absolute energy of −4.8 eV [25]. The optical HOMO−LUMO gap (E g) was calculated by UV–Visible spectroscopy, using the equation E g=1240/λ from the cut-off absorption wavelengths of the charge transfer bands (DMF; 780, DMAC; 760 and NMP; 765 nm) in visible and near infrared regions [25].

The calculated optical band gap (E g) energies of 3 are much lower when compared to those of perylene dyes most probably due to the charge transfer bands in NIR region (Table 7: Eg in DMF; 1.59, NMP; 1.62, DMAC; 1.63 and solid state; 1.93 eV) [5–7,19–21].

The diffusion coefficients (D) of 3 were estimated from the reduction potential data obtained from CV based on the Randles–Sevcik equation: i p=(2.69 × 105)n 3/2 ν 1/2 D 1/2AC, where i p is the peak current (A), n is the number of transferred electrons, ν is the scan rate (V s−1), D is the diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1), A is the electrode area (cm2), C is the concentration of the electroactive species (mol cm−3). The plots of peak current (i pc) vs. square root of scan rate (ν 1/2) give straight lines implying the diffusion controlled processes in DMF solution and in solid-state (Fig. S3 and Table S3). However, CV at the scan rate of 1000 mVs−1 was excluded from the calculation due to poor resolution. Accordingly, the diffusion coefficient values of 3 in solution (DMF) and the solid state are 1.07 × 10−8 cm2 s−1 and 1.88 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 with adjacent R 2 values of 0.92 and 0.99, respectively (Fig. S3 and Table S3). The higher diffusion coefficient in solid state infers the more stabilized and controlled diffusion processes.

The thermal properties of 3 are studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under nitrogen and thermogravimetric analysis under oxygen atmosphere, respectively (Fig. 8 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1). The DSC thermograms of TPDI shows no thermal transitions relating to the phase change up to 440 °C (Fig. 8(a)). Obviously, the amine moiety enhances the thermal stability of 3. The decomposition of 3 was initialized around 335 °C and 5% weight loss was recorded up to 440 °C (Fig. 8(b)). Comparatively, the main weight loss occurred between 440 and 650 °C. Importantly, the overall weight loss was only 50% of the original mass up to 955 °C, giving a 50% char yield. Dye 3, showed excellent thermal stability due to the amine units on the perylene core and particularly suited for high temperature applications.

In this work, we have successfully synthesized a new non-planar low bandgap perylene diimide, 3 with a high solubility, strong electron accepting ability and controllable conductivity.

In the polar aprotic and strongly electron donating solvents such as DMF, DMAC and NMP the compound has intense absorption in the visible spectrum in the wavelength range 300–800 nm. Upon excitation at 315 nm, two weak and structureless charge emission bands around 364 and 700 nm obtained. Importantly the emission of these charge transfer bands were strongly quenched whereas the emission intensity of the perylene core remarkably increases as the solution concentration increases, which is explained by photoinduced intramolecular energy transfer from 2 to 3. However, the nonplanar geometry of 3 prevented efficient energy transfer between donor and acceptor.

Pronounced solvatochromic behavior is observed in strong electron donating solvents such as NMP which is a characteristic of donor-acceptor molecules to change color. Dye 3 behaves differently in different organic solvents. In strong electron donating solvents (DMF, DMAC and NMP) charge-transfer band is observed, whereas the situation becomes inverted in nonpolar solvents. Importantly, charge transfer process can be controlled by altering the solvent used in dissolving 3.

In summary, the overall results reveal that the conjugated low band gap compound 3 is a promising candidate for high performance photonics, sensors and light harvesting systems with its tunable photophysical and electrochemical properties.

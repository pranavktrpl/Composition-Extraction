Introduction:
Due to contemporary living styles and rising population needs, the globe has experienced an energy problem in all commercial, household, technological, health, space, and research sectors in recent years. Traditional energy sources, such as power plants are damaging the environment significantly and should be changed to preserve the world and future generations. Thermoelectric materials which can convert waste heat into power are now being investigated [1–3]. Furthermore, developments in thermoelectric materials have resulted in the creation of multistage Peltier coolers that may be utilized to produce efficient cooling and heating. The efficiency of thermoelectric devices is calculated by a figure of merit (ZT) [4], which is a dimensionless quantity and can be defined as (see Table 4) (1) Z T=S 2 σ T k where S is Seebeck coefficient, σ is electrical conductivity, T is absolute temperature, k is total thermal conductivity respectively. The total thermal conductivity of the crystal is the sum of lattice thermal conductivity ( k L ) and electronic thermal conductivity ( k e l ) [5]. Half Heusler (HH) compounds have gained significant attention in research because of their application in spintronics [6–8], thermoelectrics [9–16], anti-ferromagnetism, ferromagnetism [17–19], and topological insulators [20–23]. Also, Half-Heuslers compounds attract researchers' interest for the intriguing thermoelectric properties because of their high seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity [24]. MNiSn (M=Ti, Zr, Hf) are the most reliable half Heusler compound due to their ZT value which is lying between the range 0.7 to 1.510. Thermoelectric properties of KBiX (X=Ba, Sr) are investigated by Z. F. et al. using ab inito principle and found values of ZT=2.68 (1.56) for KBiBa (KBiSr) [25]. J. Nagura and his co-workers using the first principle calculations explored the thermoelectric and mechanical properties of XHfSn (X=Ni, Pd, Pt) materials [26]. FeNbSb based half heusler compound has been explored and their value of ZT is > 1 [14], [27]. M. K. bamgbose has investigated XIrSb(X=Ti, Zr, Hf) HH compounds and found that ZT=0.87, 0.95, 0.90 for TiIrSb, TrIrSb, HfIrSb at 800 K respectively [9]. XCoSb (X=Ti, Zr, Hf) compound gain attention because of their ZT value which is equal to 1.0 at 1097 K in p-type doping [13,28]. K. Jia et al. have explored that CuLiX(X=Se, Te) are good thermoelectric material due to their high ZT value which is equal to 2.65 (1.7) for CuLiTe (CuLiSe) [29]. Fang et al. [23] have reported that due to large band degeneracy and low effective mass, the value of ZT=1.5 at 1200 K for RuTaSb half Heusler. Bi based Half Heusler compounds have investigated by A. Dey et al. using first principle calculations and reported ZT=0.7 at room temperature [30]. Thermoelectric performance of half-Heusler compounds MYSb (M=Ni, Pd, Pt) have been reported by G. Ding et al. using principle calculations [31]. In recent times, PdTaX (X=Al,Ga,In) were reported by S. Khandy with 10 times larger values of K L at 300 K. Keeping in view the above stated survey, we have designed a new PdVGa half Heusler compound using density functional theory and also explored its chemical, mechanical and dynamical stability in this manuscript. Instead of stability, we have also scrutinized the electronic and transport properties of this newly designed material. Up to our knowledge, we found that there is no theoretical and experimental work reported on this material.

Computational Details:
All the calculations are estimated using Quantum Espresso code [32] based on the density functional theory (DFT) and Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) [33] with Perdew Burke- Ernzerhof (PBE) are used for exchange-correlation functional. We have used the plane wave method with norm-conserving pseudopotential. In our calculations, the cutoff for kinetic energy is 70 Ry and for charge density cutoff is 700 Ry. Integration is calculated in the first Brillouin zone with k-points 12 × 12 × 12 under the Monkhorst-pack scheme [34]. The phonon band dispersion is computed using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [35] as implemented in Quantum Espresso package [32]. The semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory, as implemented in the BoltzTraP code [36–38] and rigid band approximation (RBA), was used to determine the thermoelectric coefficient. Deformation potential theory (DP) [39,40] based on effective mass approximation is used to determine the relaxation time (τ), which is calculated as (2) τ=8 π 1 / 2 ħ 4 C i i 3 ( m d ∗ K B T ) 3 / 2 E d 2 here m d ∗ is the effective mass of DOS, C i i is elastic constant and Ed is Deformation constant. Also, Ed is defined as (3) E d=∂ E e d g e ∂ ( Δ a a o ) where E e d g e band energy corresponding to VBM and CBM for hole and electron respectively, a o is optimized lattice constant and Δ a is distortion from equilibrium lattice parameter. The value of effective mass ( m d ∗ ) , Deformation constant (Ed) and elastic constant (Cii) Of PdVGa compound is represented in Table 2 The calculations of lattice thermal conductivity ( k L ) is done for PdVGa using Slack's equation [41–43] which is written as (4) k L=A M θ D 3 V 1 / 3 γ 2 T n 2 / 3 where M, n, V, and γ are average atomic mass, no. of atoms in the unit cell, volume and gruneisen parameter respectively. γ is calculated as (5) γ=9 − 12 ( v t v l ) 2 2 + 4 ( v t v l ) 2 here v l is longitudinal and v t is transverse velocity and dimensionless constant A is computed as: (6) A=2.43 × 10 − 8 1 − 0.514 γ + 0.228 ( γ ) 2

Results And Discussion:
3.1 Structural and electronic properties We investigated the optimized value of lattice constant of PdVGa, based upon the three possible arrangements as listed in Table 1 . The site preferences of X, Y and Z atoms are directly affect the properties of half Heusler compounds due to presence of d and sp-valent elements. Half Heusler material PdVGa have an FCC cubic crystal structure with space group F 4 ‾ 3m symmetry. Energy-volume curve fitting with Murnaghan's equation [44],to obtain the optimized value of the lattice parameter. From Fig. 1 we found that type −1 arrangement have minimum energy and corresponding optimized lattice constant (ao) is 5.93 Å observed. The electronic band structure of the PdVGa compound is represented in Fig. 2 (a). From the band structure, the minima of conduction band (CBM) and the maxima of valence band (VBM) lie at the same (K) high symmetric point, which shows that PdVGa is a direct bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.012 eV. Furthermore, the density of states (DOS) is shown in Fig. 2 (b) to comprehend the atom's orbital contribution to the band structure. It can be observed from DOS that d-orbitals of V and Pd give the main contribution in the valence band, while in conduction band d- orbital of V gives the maximum contribution. Additionally, the minor contribution is due to the p-orbital of Ga in both valence band and conduction band. The semiconducting, magnetic, and non-magnetic nature of half Heusler compound is computed by Slater-Pauling rule [45], which is expressed by M t=( Z t − 18 ) μ B . Here M t , Z t represent the total magnetic moment and total number of valence electron of unit cell. PdVGa has 18 valence electrons, so from slater -Pauling rule, the obtained M t=0 , which implies this PdVGa compound has non-magnetic nature. 3.1.1 Stability In Fig. 2 (c) Phonon Dispersion Curves of PdVGa is shown along with (Γ- X-W-K- Γ) high symmetry K- points. It reveals that there are no negative phonon modes of frequencies exist, which means PdVGa is dynamically stable. Due to the three atoms in this material, the phonon structure has nine modes, three of which are acoustical and rest are optical modes. The maximum frequency corresponding to acoustical mode is 155 cm−1 . The formation enthalpy ( Δ E f ) and cohesive energy ( Δ E c ) is computed to validate the synthesizability of PdVGa half Heusler compound using the following equations [11,46]: (7) Δ E f=[ E ( P d V G a ) n B u l k − n E ( P d ) b c c − n E ( V ) b c c − n E ( G a ) t e t r a g o n a l ] / n (8) Δ E c=[ E ( P d V G a ) n B u l k − n E ( P d ) a t o m − n E ( V ) a t o m − n E ( G a ) a t o m ] / 2 n where E ( P d X S n ) n B u l k , E ( P d ) b c c , E ( V ) b c c , E ( G a ) b c c is the total energy of PdXSn, Pd, V, and Ga systems respectively. E ( P d ) a t o m , E ( V ) a t o m , E ( G a ) a t o m are the energy of Pd, V, and Ga in free space. The obtained value of formation enthalpy is −2.169 eV and cohesive energy is −2.47 eV for the PdVGa compound. Both formation and cohesive energy have negative values, which indicate the chemical stability of PdVGa compound and can be synthesis experimentally. Table 3 . lists of computed elastic parameters of PdVGa HH material, such as elastic constants (C11, C12, and C44), shear modulus(G), bulk modulus(B), Young modulus (Y), Pugh ratio(B/G), etc. The Born-Huang stability criterion [47] may be used to determine the mechanical stability of PdVGa compound, which is stated as (9) C 11 > 0 , C 44 > 0 , C 11 − C 12 > 0 a n d C 11 + 2 C 12 > 0 From Table 2, we found that this newly designed half Heusler compound satisfies the Born-Huang stability criterion. The bulk modulus (B) and shear modulus (G) of PdVGa are evaluated using Voigt–Reuss–Hill approximations (VRH) [48,49]. The bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G), Young's modulus (Y), longitudinal ( v l ) and transverse ( v t ) velocity is defined as [25]. (10) B=( C 11 + 2 C 12 ) 3 (11) G=( C 11 − C 12 + C 13 ) 5 + 5 ( C 11 − C 12 ) 3 ( C 11 − C 12 ) + 4 C 44 2 (12) Y=9 BG 3 B + G (13) v l=G ρ (14) v t=( 3 B + 4 G ) 3 ρ Anderson's formula [50] is used to calculate Debye temperature θ D in terms of longitudinal and transverse velocity as follows: (15) θ D=ħ k B ( 3 n ρ N A 4 π M ) 1 / 3 [ 1 3 ( 1 v l 3 + 1 v t 3 ) ] − 1 / 3 where ħ is reduced plank constant, k B is Boltzmann constant, n is no. of atoms in the unit cell, N A Avogadro's number and M is the atomic mass of the unit crystal cell. Pugh's ratio [51] (B/G) is used for elaborating the brittleness and ductility of the alloy. The ratio B/G < 1.75, implies brittleness and vice -versa ductility of materials. In this case the value of B/G=3.19, so PdVGa compound has ductile nature. 3.1.2 Thermoelectric properties Thermoelectric parameters are calculated at various temperature as a function of chemical potential(μ) to determine thermoelectric performance. Fig. 3 represents the behaviour of lattice thermal conductivity ( k L ) with temperature. As temperature increases, the lattice thermal conductivity decreases because of lattice scattering. Hence, the lattice scattering plays a significant role to reduce the k L with temperature. From the observation, the calculated value of lattice thermal conductivity is 4.60 W/mK at 300 K. We studied phonon dispersion and estimated group velocity for PdVGa Compound to further analyzed the low value of lattice thermal conductivity. The maximum frequency corresponding to acoustical mode is 155 cm−1 . The group velocities of phonons are described by the equation v g=d ω d k , which represents the slope of related branches and also the formula for Debye temperature [52] is θ D=ħ ω / k B. So, the calculated value of group velocity is 2.5 Km/s and Debye temperature is 297.76 K. Thermal conductivity [53,54] is directly manifested from the group velocity and Debye temperature, which there by leads to such a low value thermal conductivity in PdVGa material. The value of lattice thermal conductivity of PdVGa compound is compared with other Half Heusler compounds as listed in Table 4 . Seebeck coefficient measures a material's ability to generate voltages from a temperature gradient. Fig. 4 (a) represents Seebeck coefficient (S) in the region −1.0 eV–1.0 eV at various temperatures (300 K, 500 K, and 700 K) as a function of μ. According to Mott's formula [25], Seebeck coefficient is computed as (16) S=8 π 2 k B 2 3 e h 2 m ∗ T [ π 3 n ] 2 / 3 The value of S decreases as the carrier concentration increases with temperature and directly depend on effective mass ( m∗=ħ 2 d 2 E d k 2 ) . In this case PdVGa, the calculated value of m* is high because of flat bands in the band structure. Therefore, the maximum computed value of the Seebeck coefficient is high and is equal to +763 μV/K at 300 K. We have used the relaxation time, which is calculated using DP theory, to express electrical conductivity(σ) as place of σ/τ. In Fig. 4 (b), plotted the electrical conductivity with chemical potential and temperature. The highest value of σ is 28.61 × 10 4 S/m at room temperature. Due to the rise in temperature, the scattering of electrons also increases, which leads to a decrease in the value of electrical conductivity. Both electrical conductivity and electronic thermal conductivity have the same behavior with temperature as they are related to each other by Wiedemann- Franz law ( k e l=LσT, here L is Lorentz number). Fig. 4(d) depict the variation of figure of merit (ZT) with chemical potential at various temperature. The observed highest value of ZT=0.048 at 700 K. The obtained ZT value for PdVGa material is low as compared to the state of art material. But material's performance may be enhanced by applying strain and doping etc. X. Chen et al. reported low ZT∼0.06–0.09 for Half Heusler NiTiZ (Z=Si, Ge, Sn) [61], which is comparable to PdVGa compound.

Due to contemporary living styles and rising population needs, the globe has experienced an energy problem in all commercial, household, technological, health, space, and research sectors in recent years. Traditional energy sources, such as power plants are damaging the environment significantly and should be changed to preserve the world and future generations. Thermoelectric materials which can convert waste heat into power are now being investigated [1–3]. Furthermore, developments in thermoelectric materials have resulted in the creation of multistage Peltier coolers that may be utilized to produce efficient cooling and heating. The efficiency of thermoelectric devices is calculated by a figure of merit (ZT) [4], which is a dimensionless quantity and can be defined as (see Table 4) (1) Z T=S 2 σ T k where S is Seebeck coefficient, σ is electrical conductivity, T is absolute temperature, k is total thermal conductivity respectively. The total thermal conductivity of the crystal is the sum of lattice thermal conductivity ( k L ) and electronic thermal conductivity ( k e l ) [5]. Half Heusler (HH) compounds have gained significant attention in research because of their application in spintronics [6–8], thermoelectrics [9–16], anti-ferromagnetism, ferromagnetism [17–19], and topological insulators [20–23]. Also, Half-Heuslers compounds attract researchers' interest for the intriguing thermoelectric properties because of their high seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity [24]. MNiSn (M=Ti, Zr, Hf) are the most reliable half Heusler compound due to their ZT value which is lying between the range 0.7 to 1.510. Thermoelectric properties of KBiX (X=Ba, Sr) are investigated by Z. F. et al. using ab inito principle and found values of ZT=2.68 (1.56) for KBiBa (KBiSr) [25]. J. Nagura and his co-workers using the first principle calculations explored the thermoelectric and mechanical properties of XHfSn (X=Ni, Pd, Pt) materials [26]. FeNbSb based half heusler compound has been explored and their value of ZT is > 1 [14], [27]. M. K. bamgbose has investigated XIrSb(X=Ti, Zr, Hf) HH compounds and found that ZT=0.87, 0.95, 0.90 for TiIrSb, TrIrSb, HfIrSb at 800 K respectively [9]. XCoSb (X=Ti, Zr, Hf) compound gain attention because of their ZT value which is equal to 1.0 at 1097 K in p-type doping [13,28]. K. Jia et al. have explored that CuLiX(X=Se, Te) are good thermoelectric material due to their high ZT value which is equal to 2.65 (1.7) for CuLiTe (CuLiSe) [29]. Fang et al. [23] have reported that due to large band degeneracy and low effective mass, the value of ZT=1.5 at 1200 K for RuTaSb half Heusler. Bi based Half Heusler compounds have investigated by A. Dey et al. using first principle calculations and reported ZT=0.7 at room temperature [30]. Thermoelectric performance of half-Heusler compounds MYSb (M=Ni, Pd, Pt) have been reported by G. Ding et al. using principle calculations [31]. In recent times, PdTaX (X=Al,Ga,In) were reported by S. Khandy with 10 times larger values of K L at 300 K. Keeping in view the above stated survey, we have designed a new PdVGa half Heusler compound using density functional theory and also explored its chemical, mechanical and dynamical stability in this manuscript. Instead of stability, we have also scrutinized the electronic and transport properties of this newly designed material. Up to our knowledge, we found that there is no theoretical and experimental work reported on this material.

All the calculations are estimated using Quantum Espresso code [32] based on the density functional theory (DFT) and Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) [33] with Perdew Burke- Ernzerhof (PBE) are used for exchange-correlation functional. We have used the plane wave method with norm-conserving pseudopotential. In our calculations, the cutoff for kinetic energy is 70 Ry and for charge density cutoff is 700 Ry. Integration is calculated in the first Brillouin zone with k-points 12 × 12 × 12 under the Monkhorst-pack scheme [34]. The phonon band dispersion is computed using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [35] as implemented in Quantum Espresso package [32]. The semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory, as implemented in the BoltzTraP code [36–38] and rigid band approximation (RBA), was used to determine the thermoelectric coefficient. Deformation potential theory (DP) [39,40] based on effective mass approximation is used to determine the relaxation time (τ), which is calculated as (2) τ=8 π 1 / 2 ħ 4 C i i 3 ( m d ∗ K B T ) 3 / 2 E d 2 here m d ∗ is the effective mass of DOS, C i i is elastic constant and Ed is Deformation constant. Also, Ed is defined as (3) E d=∂ E e d g e ∂ ( Δ a a o ) where E e d g e band energy corresponding to VBM and CBM for hole and electron respectively, a o is optimized lattice constant and Δ a is distortion from equilibrium lattice parameter. The value of effective mass ( m d ∗ ) , Deformation constant (Ed) and elastic constant (Cii) Of PdVGa compound is represented in Table 2 The calculations of lattice thermal conductivity ( k L ) is done for PdVGa using Slack's equation [41–43] which is written as (4) k L=A M θ D 3 V 1 / 3 γ 2 T n 2 / 3 where M, n, V, and γ are average atomic mass, no. of atoms in the unit cell, volume and gruneisen parameter respectively. γ is calculated as (5) γ=9 − 12 ( v t v l ) 2 2 + 4 ( v t v l ) 2 here v l is longitudinal and v t is transverse velocity and dimensionless constant A is computed as: (6) A=2.43 × 10 − 8 1 − 0.514 γ + 0.228 ( γ ) 2

We investigated the optimized value of lattice constant of PdVGa, based upon the three possible arrangements as listed in Table 1 . The site preferences of X, Y and Z atoms are directly affect the properties of half Heusler compounds due to presence of d and sp-valent elements. Half Heusler material PdVGa have an FCC cubic crystal structure with space group F 4 ‾ 3m symmetry. Energy-volume curve fitting with Murnaghan's equation [44],to obtain the optimized value of the lattice parameter. From Fig. 1 we found that type −1 arrangement have minimum energy and corresponding optimized lattice constant (ao) is 5.93 Å observed.

The electronic band structure of the PdVGa compound is represented in Fig. 2 (a). From the band structure, the minima of conduction band (CBM) and the maxima of valence band (VBM) lie at the same (K) high symmetric point, which shows that PdVGa is a direct bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.012 eV. Furthermore, the density of states (DOS) is shown in Fig. 2 (b) to comprehend the atom's orbital contribution to the band structure. It can be observed from DOS that d-orbitals of V and Pd give the main contribution in the valence band, while in conduction band d- orbital of V gives the maximum contribution. Additionally, the minor contribution is due to the p-orbital of Ga in both valence band and conduction band. The semiconducting, magnetic, and non-magnetic nature of half Heusler compound is computed by Slater-Pauling rule [45], which is expressed by M t=( Z t − 18 ) μ B . Here M t , Z t represent the total magnetic moment and total number of valence electron of unit cell. PdVGa has 18 valence electrons, so from slater -Pauling rule, the obtained M t=0 , which implies this PdVGa compound has non-magnetic nature.

In Fig. 2 (c) Phonon Dispersion Curves of PdVGa is shown along with (Γ- X-W-K- Γ) high symmetry K- points. It reveals that there are no negative phonon modes of frequencies exist, which means PdVGa is dynamically stable. Due to the three atoms in this material, the phonon structure has nine modes, three of which are acoustical and rest are optical modes. The maximum frequency corresponding to acoustical mode is 155 cm−1 .

The formation enthalpy ( Δ E f ) and cohesive energy ( Δ E c ) is computed to validate the synthesizability of PdVGa half Heusler compound using the following equations [11,46]: (7) Δ E f=[ E ( P d V G a ) n B u l k − n E ( P d ) b c c − n E ( V ) b c c − n E ( G a ) t e t r a g o n a l ] / n (8) Δ E c=[ E ( P d V G a ) n B u l k − n E ( P d ) a t o m − n E ( V ) a t o m − n E ( G a ) a t o m ] / 2 n where E ( P d X S n ) n B u l k , E ( P d ) b c c , E ( V ) b c c , E ( G a ) b c c is the total energy of PdXSn, Pd, V, and Ga systems respectively. E ( P d ) a t o m , E ( V ) a t o m , E ( G a ) a t o m are the energy of Pd, V, and Ga in free space. The obtained value of formation enthalpy is −2.169 eV and cohesive energy is −2.47 eV for the PdVGa compound. Both formation and cohesive energy have negative values, which indicate the chemical stability of PdVGa compound and can be synthesis experimentally.

Table 3 . lists of computed elastic parameters of PdVGa HH material, such as elastic constants (C11, C12, and C44), shear modulus(G), bulk modulus(B), Young modulus (Y), Pugh ratio(B/G), etc. The Born-Huang stability criterion [47] may be used to determine the mechanical stability of PdVGa compound, which is stated as (9) C 11 > 0 , C 44 > 0 , C 11 − C 12 > 0 a n d C 11 + 2 C 12 > 0

From Table 2, we found that this newly designed half Heusler compound satisfies the Born-Huang stability criterion. The bulk modulus (B) and shear modulus (G) of PdVGa are evaluated using Voigt–Reuss–Hill approximations (VRH) [48,49]. The bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G), Young's modulus (Y), longitudinal ( v l ) and transverse ( v t ) velocity is defined as [25]. (10) B=( C 11 + 2 C 12 ) 3 (11) G=( C 11 − C 12 + C 13 ) 5 + 5 ( C 11 − C 12 ) 3 ( C 11 − C 12 ) + 4 C 44 2 (12) Y=9 BG 3 B + G (13) v l=G ρ (14) v t=( 3 B + 4 G ) 3 ρ

Anderson's formula [50] is used to calculate Debye temperature θ D in terms of longitudinal and transverse velocity as follows: (15) θ D=ħ k B ( 3 n ρ N A 4 π M ) 1 / 3 [ 1 3 ( 1 v l 3 + 1 v t 3 ) ] − 1 / 3 where ħ is reduced plank constant, k B is Boltzmann constant, n is no. of atoms in the unit cell, N A Avogadro's number and M is the atomic mass of the unit crystal cell. Pugh's ratio [51] (B/G) is used for elaborating the brittleness and ductility of the alloy. The ratio B/G < 1.75, implies brittleness and vice -versa ductility of materials. In this case the value of B/G=3.19, so PdVGa compound has ductile nature.

Thermoelectric parameters are calculated at various temperature as a function of chemical potential(μ) to determine thermoelectric performance. Fig. 3 represents the behaviour of lattice thermal conductivity ( k L ) with temperature. As temperature increases, the lattice thermal conductivity decreases because of lattice scattering. Hence, the lattice scattering plays a significant role to reduce the k L with temperature. From the observation, the calculated value of lattice thermal conductivity is 4.60 W/mK at 300 K. We studied phonon dispersion and estimated group velocity for PdVGa Compound to further analyzed the low value of lattice thermal conductivity. The maximum frequency corresponding to acoustical mode is 155 cm−1 . The group velocities of phonons are described by the equation v g=d ω d k , which represents the slope of related branches and also the formula for Debye temperature [52] is θ D=ħ ω / k B. So, the calculated value of group velocity is 2.5 Km/s and Debye temperature is 297.76 K. Thermal conductivity [53,54] is directly manifested from the group velocity and Debye temperature, which there by leads to such a low value thermal conductivity in PdVGa material. The value of lattice thermal conductivity of PdVGa compound is compared with other Half Heusler compounds as listed in Table 4 .

Seebeck coefficient measures a material's ability to generate voltages from a temperature gradient. Fig. 4 (a) represents Seebeck coefficient (S) in the region −1.0 eV–1.0 eV at various temperatures (300 K, 500 K, and 700 K) as a function of μ. According to Mott's formula [25], Seebeck coefficient is computed as (16) S=8 π 2 k B 2 3 e h 2 m ∗ T [ π 3 n ] 2 / 3

The value of S decreases as the carrier concentration increases with temperature and directly depend on effective mass ( m∗=ħ 2 d 2 E d k 2 ) . In this case PdVGa, the calculated value of m* is high because of flat bands in the band structure. Therefore, the maximum computed value of the Seebeck coefficient is high and is equal to +763 μV/K at 300 K.

We have used the relaxation time, which is calculated using DP theory, to express electrical conductivity(σ) as place of σ/τ. In Fig. 4 (b), plotted the electrical conductivity with chemical potential and temperature. The highest value of σ is 28.61 × 10 4 S/m at room temperature. Due to the rise in temperature, the scattering of electrons also increases, which leads to a decrease in the value of electrical conductivity. Both electrical conductivity and electronic thermal conductivity have the same behavior with temperature as they are related to each other by Wiedemann- Franz law ( k e l=LσT, here L is Lorentz number). Fig. 4(d) depict the variation of figure of merit (ZT) with chemical potential at various temperature. The observed highest value of ZT=0.048 at 700 K. The obtained ZT value for PdVGa material is low as compared to the state of art material. But material's performance may be enhanced by applying strain and doping etc. X. Chen et al. reported low ZT∼0.06–0.09 for Half Heusler NiTiZ (Z=Si, Ge, Sn) [61], which is comparable to PdVGa compound.

We investigate structural, electronic, and thermoelectric properties of PdVGa using density functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory. We found that this material has semiconducting nature with a direct bandgap of 1.012 eV. Elastic properties confirm the mechanical stability and ductile nature. PdVGa compound has the lowest lattice thermal conductivity due to lattice scattering and is equal to 4.60 W/mK at 300 K. We found that ZT=0.048 for PdVGa half Heusler compound at 700 K.

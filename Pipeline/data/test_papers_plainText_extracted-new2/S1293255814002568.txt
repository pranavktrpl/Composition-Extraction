Title:
Elastic  phonon and thermodynamic properties of ZnAl

Abstract:
First–principles calculations are performed to investigate the elastic, phonon and thermodynamic properties of ZnAl2O4 and ZnAl2S4 structures. The equations of state are fitted by a four–parameter Birch–Murnaghan equation upon the first–principles energy vs. volume data. Three independent elastic constants c 11, c 12 and c 44 at zero pressure are determined by strain energy vs. strain relationships, and the two structures are both mechanically stable. Elastic properties including bulk moduli, shear moduli, Young's moduli, Poisson's ratios and anisotropy values for both phases are estimated by Voigt–Reuss–Hill averaging scheme. The mechanical properties such as ductility and brittleness are further analyzed. The density functional perturbation theory is utilized to calculate the phonon properties and both phases are found to be dynamically stable. The phonon and Debye models are used to predict the thermodynamic properties such as the Gibbs free energies, entropies and specific heats at constant pressure for ZnAl2O4 and ZnAl2S4 compounds.

Introduction:
A large group of compounds with spinel structure are generally described by the AB2X4 formula, where A is divalent cation, B is a trivalent cation and X is a divalent anion. Compounds in this family usually have wide band gaps and are attractive in theory and experiments for better understanding of their physical properties [1–4]. In the normal spinel with cubic symmetry (space group Fd-3m), the A atoms occupy the center of tetrahedral sites and the B atoms occupy the center of octahedral sites. The main characteristic feature of spinel structure is the ability to host a wide range of divalent, trivalent, and tetravalent cations. ZnAl2O4 (ZAO) and ZnAl2S4 (ZAS) belong to this fascinating materials family.
At present, first–principles techniques have been demonstrated to be able to accurately describe the electronic structures, mechanical properties, optical and phonon spectra for different materials including ZAO [5–9]. Khenata et al. [10] studied the structural, electronic and elastic properties of ZAO using the full potential linear augmented plane wave (FP–LAPW) method as implemented in the WIEN97 code. In this approach the local density approximation (LDA) was used for the exchange–correlation (XC) potential. Sampath et al. [11] studied the electronic structure of ZAO by the self–consistent tight–binding linearized muffin–tin orbital method with the atomic sphere approximation. The vibrational properties and experimental data of phonon frequencies for ZAO are limited to the vicinity of the Γ point in the Brillouin zone (BZ) [5,12,13]. In the case of ZAS, there is relatively less experimental or theoretical research work [14]. For the understanding of elastic properties of a structure, first–principles derived elastic constants give quite satisfactory evaluation of the bulk modulus and shear modulus [15–17]. Furthermore, first–principles calculations together with the quasiharmonic approximation can accurately predict finite temperature thermodynamic properties of solids [18,19]. This approach provides reliable predictions of the thermodynamic properties especially when experimental information is lacking.
In this paper, we report first–principles calculations for the elastic, phonon and thermodynamic properties of ZAO and ZAS spinel. The crystal structures of ZAO and ZAS are firstly optimized, and the energy vs. volume (E–V) data are fitted by a four–parameter Birch–Murnaghan equation of state (EOS) [20]. Then the elastic constants and bulk elastic properties are derived; the ductility, brittleness and anisotropy of ZAO and ZAS are also discussed. The phonon dispersions and phonon density of states (PhDOS) at the theoretical equilibrium volumes are analyzed. Finally the thermodynamic properties including the Gibbs free energies, entropies and specific heats at constant pressure are predicted.

Computational Details:
In this work the first–principles calculations for ZAO and ZAS are performed by Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code [21–23]. The electron–ion interactions are described by the full potential frozen–core projector augmented wave (PAW) [24] method, and the exchange–correlation is treated within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [25,26] of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) [27]. In VASP calculations, the wave functions are sampled on 11 × 11 × 11 k–point mesh based on Monkhorst–Pack [28] scheme together with the linear tetrahedron method including Blöchl corrections [29]. The energy cutoff of the wave function is 1.3 times as large as the maximum default value. The energy convergence criterion for electronic self–consistency is 10−6 eV/cell.
The Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) [30] is also used for the calculation of elastic properties. The ultrasoft pseudopotentials are used for all elements and the GGA with PBE functional is employed for the exchange correlation of electrons. The Monkhorst–Pack scheme k–points grid sampling is set as 2 × 2 × 2 in the Brillouin zone and the plane–wave energy cutoff is 310 eV. The convergence parameters are set as follows: total energy tolerance 10−5 eV/atom, force tolerance 0.03 eV/Å, maximum stress component 0.05 GPa and maximum displacement 0.001 Å.
The phonon properties of ZAO and ZAS are calculated by using the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [31] with 2 × 2 × 2 supercells. The displacement of 0.015 Å is adopted for each independent atom in the supercell in order to calculate the forces acting on the atoms. The phonon frequencies and phonon density of states (PhDOS) are obtained by PHONOPY [32] from the calculated dynamical matrix. By means of the phonon model and the Debye model, the thermodynamic properties of ZAO and ZAS, such as the Gibbs free energies, entropies and specific heats at constant pressure can be predicted [20,33].

Results And Discussion:
3.1 Structures and equations of state The ZAO and ZAS compounds crystallize at ambient pressure in a diamond–type cubic spinel structure with space-group Fd-3m (227). The Zn atoms are located at the Wyckoff positions 8a (1/8, 1/8, 1/8) tetrahedral sites, while Al atoms are located at the 16d (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) octahedral sites and the O or S atoms are located at 32e (u, u, u) sites. In order to estimate the equilibrium structural properties including the energy E 0, bulk modulus B 0 and its pressure derivative B 0′ for ZAO and ZAS, the E–V relationships obtained from first–principles are fitted by a four–parameter Birch–Murnaghan (BM) equation of state (EOS), which is one of the most commonly used formula in the fitting of E–V data. It is the result of assuming a polynomial form of the energy [20]: (1) E ( f )=∑ k=0 n c k f k in terms of the finite Eulerian strains: (2) f=[ ( V r / V ) 2 / 3 − 1 ] / 2 where V r is a reference volume. The E–V relationships for ZAO and ZAS are shown in Fig. 1 and fitted by the four-parameter BM EOS. The calculated equilibrium lattice constants are 8.179 and 10.086 Å, in good agreement with the experimental values of 8.086 Å [34] and 10.005 Å [35] for ZAO and ZAS, respectively. The errors of lattice constants are about 1%. The bulk modulus B 0 is 188 GPa and its pressure derivative B 0′ is 4.26 for ZAO, while for ZAS B 0 is 85 GPa and B 0′ is 4.42.
3.2 Elastic properties The elastic constants can be obtained by calculating the total energy as a function of applied strains which break the crystal symmetry. For cubic crystals, the three elastic constants c 11, c 12 and c 44 are calculated under the hydrostatic pressures e 1=(δ, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), e 2=(δ, δ, 0, 0, 0, 0) and e 3=(0, 0, 0, δ, 0, 0). Seven deformations 0%,±0.5%,±1% and±2% are applied to determine each elastic constant, and the systems are fully relaxed after each deformation in order to reach the equilibrium state. Then c 11, c 12 and c 44 can be obtained from the second–order fitting to the strain energy vs. strain relationships [36]. The obtained elastic constants are presented in Table 1 and are in good agreement with other referenced data. The results from VASP and CASTEP are close to each other, in particular for ZAS. The mechanical stabilities of materials can be estimated from the stability criteria, and the criterion for cubic crystals is known to be c 11 > 0, c 44 > 0 and c 11-c 12 > 0. The elastic constants of ZAO and ZAS derived from different methods all satisfy this criterion, indicating that the two phases are both mechanically stable. Since the octahedra in ZAS are softer than those in ZAO due to the coupling between atomic displacements and shear strains, the resulted c 11, c 12 and c 44 values for ZAS are smaller than those of ZAO. It is known that the plastic properties of materials are related with their elastic moduli. The bulk modulus B represents the resistance of a material against volume change under hydrostatic pressure, and the shear modulus G is the resistance to shape change caused by shearing force. The elastic moduli can be calculated by Voigt–Reuss–Hill (VRH) approach [38–40]. Young's modulus Y is defined as the ratio of the stress to the strain, and it is used to provide a measurement of the stiffness of the solid. Larger the Young's modulus is, stiffer the material is. It can be calculated from B and G: (3) Y=9 B G 3 B + G Poisson's ratio ν generally provides more information about the characteristic of the bonding forces than any of the other elastic moduli. It can be calculated by: (4) ν=3 B − 2 G 2 ( 3 B + G ) All the calculated results are listed in Table 1. The bulk modulus of ZAO is larger than that of ZAS, which indicates that ZAO is a relatively harder material. Pugh's criterion B/G with the critical value of 1.75 is used to estimate the ductile or brittle nature [41]. When B/G >1.75, the material is ductile and its hardness is lower, otherwise it behaves in a brittle manner. As can be seen from Table 1 the values of B/G are larger than 1.75 for both ZAO and ZAS, indicating that the two phases are ductile at ambient conditions and ZAO is stiffer than ZAS. The values of Poisson's ratio ν for covalent materials are small, i.e. ν=0.1, whereas for ionic materials a typical value of ν is 0.25. The calculated Poisson's ratios are close to 0.25, which means that both materials are with predominantly central inter–atomic forces [42]. Since larger Poisson's ratio is related with larger ductile, the results indicate that ZAO and ZAS have almost similar ductility. The Zener anisotropy factor A is an indicator of the degree of elastic anisotropy of one crystal and is calculated by [39]: (5) A=2 c 44 c 11 − c 12 For a completely isotropic material, the factor A takes the value of 1. It can be seen that ZAO and ZAS have anisotropic factors of 2.16 and 2.45, respectively, indicating that they are both strong anisotropic materials.
3.3 Phonon and thermodynamic properties The phonon dispersion curves and partial atomic phonon density of states (PhDOS) at the theoretical equilibrium volumes for ZAO and ZAS along several high–symmetry directions are presented in Fig. 2 a and b. The primitive cells of ZAO and ZAS contains 14 atoms, which gives rise to a total of 42 phonon branches, including 3 acoustic modes and 39 optical modes. There are no imaginary phonons for both materials in the Brillouin zone (BZ), indicating that they are dynamically stable. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the low–lying optical phonon modes have interaction with the acoustic phonon modes for ZAO and ZAS. For the PhDOS of ZAO, the acoustic modes are mainly dominated by the vibration of Zn atoms, while the optical modes are mainly contributed by the vibration of Al and O atoms, with more contribution from O than Al. In the case of ZAS, the acoustic modes also stem from Zn atoms, with a contribution of Al and S atoms for optical modes. Moreover, there is strong hybridization between Al and O/S atoms. ZAO has higher phonon energies than ZAS at the Γ point. The main difference between the two compounds is due to the fact that the chemical bonds in ZAO are stronger than ZAS and S atom is heavier than O atom. The phonon modes at the Γ point for the space group Fd-3m are classified as [43]: Γ=A 1g(R) + E g(R) + T 1g + 3T 2g(R) + 2A 2u + 2E u + 4T 1u(IR) + 2T 2u. The subscripts u and g represent relatively symmetric modes and antisymmetric modes in antisymmetric center, E g and E u are double degenerate modes, while A g and A u are single degenerate modes. R and IR represent Raman and infrared active modes, and the others are inactive silent modes. Table 2 summarizes the phonon frequencies and symmetries of the vibrational modes at Γ point together with the referenced data. For ZAO, there is good agreement between the present results and other experimental or theoretical ones. The T 2g and T 1u mode are mainly contributed by Zn vibrations, while other modes are strongly influenced by Al and O/S vibrations. The major difference in the phonon frequencies of ZAO and ZAS can be accounted for the chemical bonds effects and atomic mass effects. The Raman and infrared phonon frequencies at Γ point are presented in Table 3 . The Raman active T 2g frequencies for ZAO are 183, 480 and 574 cm−1, while for ZAS they are 135, 301 and 374 cm−1. The E g frequency is 399 cm−1 for ZAO and 229 cm−1 for ZAS. The calculated TO frequencies for ZAO are 210, 454, 524 and 625 cm−1, close to experimental data. While the LO frequencies are 221, 505, 619 and 792 cm−1. The reason for the difference between our work and other theoretical results may due to the different pseudopotentials and k–point sampling chosen in the calculations. The TO frequencies of ZAS are 136, 296, 335 and 395 cm−1, while the LO frequencies are 137, 309, 342 and 470 cm−1. The thermodynamic properties including the Gibbs free energies G, entropies S and specific heats at constant pressure C P for ZAO and ZAS can be calculated by using the phonon model or Debye model. The Debye model including the Slater model, Dugdale–McDonald (DM) model and Vaschenko–Zubarev (VZ) model are used in this work [33,44,45]. The Gibbs free energy G of a given structure at volume V and temperature T can be represented by: (6) G ( V , T )=E 0 ( V ) + F vib ( V , T ) + F el ( V , T ) where E 0(V) is the static energy at 0 K which can be easily obtained from first–principles calculations, F vib(V, T) is the vibrational free energy of the lattice ions, F el (V, T) is the free energy due to thermal electronic contribution. The vibrational free energy of a structure F vib can be calculated within the quasiharmonic approximation from phonon or Debye models. In phonon model, it can be derived from the phonon density of states [45]: (7) F vib ( T )=k B T ∫ 0 ∞ ln 2 sinh ℏ ω 2 k B T g ( ω ) ⅆ ω where ω is the phonon frequency and g(ω) is the phonon density of state (PhDOS). In Debye model, F vib is calculated as a function of Debye temperature Θ D [33]: (8) F vib ( V , T )=9 8 k B Θ D + k B { 3 ln [ 1 − exp ( − Θ D T ) − D ( Θ D T ) ] } where D ( x )=3 / x 3 ∫ 0 x t 3 / [ exp ( t ) − 1 ] ⅆ t is the Debye function. Thermal electronic contribution to Gibbs free energy is determined by Mermin statistics F el=E el – TS el , and the internal energy at volume V and temperature T due to electronic excitations is given by [45]: (9) E el ( T )=∫ n ɛ f ɛ ⅆ ɛ − ∫ ɛ F n ɛ f ɛ ⅆ ɛ where n(ɛ) is the electronic DOS, ɛ the energy eigenvalues, ɛ F the energy at the Fermi level and f the Fermi distribution function. The bare electronic entropy due to electronic excitations is written by [45]: (10) S el ( T )=− k B ∫ n ɛ f ln f + 1 − f ln 1 − f ⅆ ɛ The results for ZAO and ZAS are presented in Figs. 3–5 . For Gibbs free energies in Fig. 3, it is found that the differences between the results obtained from phonon model and Debye model are quite small. Even at temperature of 1600K, the differences are less than 2 kJ mol−1 and 3 kJ mol−1 for ZAO and ZAS, respectively. The entropy is an extensive state function which accounts for the effects of irreversibility in thermodynamic systems, and it can be defined as the change to a more disorder state at molecular level. From Fig. 4, entropies of ZAO are larger than that of ZAS at the same temperature, as the weaker chemical bonds in ZAO can cause the structure to a more disorder state than ZAS. The specific heat at constant pressure C P is obtained based on the following equation: (11) C P=( ∂ H ∂ T ) P=C V ( 1 + γ t h α T ) where C V is the heat capacity at constant volume, α is the linear thermal expansion coefficient, γ t h is the thermodynamic Grüneisen ratio. Fig. 5 shows the specific heats at constant pressure for ZAO and ZAS as a function of temperature. The four lines match very well at low temperature (up to 300 K). The results from phonon model show that C P of ZAO and ZAS at 300 K are about 19 J mol−1·K−1 and 23 J mol−1·K−1, respectively. When the temperature is larger than 300 K, the results from phonon model become smaller than those from Debye model. There are few reported experimental results for the thermodynamic properties of ZAO and ZAS, our predicted results may be helpful for further works.

Structures And Equations Of State:
The ZAO and ZAS compounds crystallize at ambient pressure in a diamond–type cubic spinel structure with space-group Fd-3m (227). The Zn atoms are located at the Wyckoff positions 8a (1/8, 1/8, 1/8) tetrahedral sites, while Al atoms are located at the 16d (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) octahedral sites and the O or S atoms are located at 32e (u, u, u) sites. In order to estimate the equilibrium structural properties including the energy E 0, bulk modulus B 0 and its pressure derivative B 0′ for ZAO and ZAS, the E–V relationships obtained from first–principles are fitted by a four–parameter Birch–Murnaghan (BM) equation of state (EOS), which is one of the most commonly used formula in the fitting of E–V data. It is the result of assuming a polynomial form of the energy [20]: (1) E ( f )=∑ k=0 n c k f k in terms of the finite Eulerian strains: (2) f=[ ( V r / V ) 2 / 3 − 1 ] / 2 where V r is a reference volume.
The E–V relationships for ZAO and ZAS are shown in Fig. 1 and fitted by the four-parameter BM EOS. The calculated equilibrium lattice constants are 8.179 and 10.086 Å, in good agreement with the experimental values of 8.086 Å [34] and 10.005 Å [35] for ZAO and ZAS, respectively. The errors of lattice constants are about 1%. The bulk modulus B 0 is 188 GPa and its pressure derivative B 0′ is 4.26 for ZAO, while for ZAS B 0 is 85 GPa and B 0′ is 4.42.

Elastic Properties:
The elastic constants can be obtained by calculating the total energy as a function of applied strains which break the crystal symmetry. For cubic crystals, the three elastic constants c 11, c 12 and c 44 are calculated under the hydrostatic pressures e 1=(δ, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), e 2=(δ, δ, 0, 0, 0, 0) and e 3=(0, 0, 0, δ, 0, 0). Seven deformations 0%,±0.5%,±1% and±2% are applied to determine each elastic constant, and the systems are fully relaxed after each deformation in order to reach the equilibrium state. Then c 11, c 12 and c 44 can be obtained from the second–order fitting to the strain energy vs. strain relationships [36]. The obtained elastic constants are presented in Table 1 and are in good agreement with other referenced data. The results from VASP and CASTEP are close to each other, in particular for ZAS.
The mechanical stabilities of materials can be estimated from the stability criteria, and the criterion for cubic crystals is known to be c 11 > 0, c 44 > 0 and c 11-c 12 > 0. The elastic constants of ZAO and ZAS derived from different methods all satisfy this criterion, indicating that the two phases are both mechanically stable. Since the octahedra in ZAS are softer than those in ZAO due to the coupling between atomic displacements and shear strains, the resulted c 11, c 12 and c 44 values for ZAS are smaller than those of ZAO.
It is known that the plastic properties of materials are related with their elastic moduli. The bulk modulus B represents the resistance of a material against volume change under hydrostatic pressure, and the shear modulus G is the resistance to shape change caused by shearing force. The elastic moduli can be calculated by Voigt–Reuss–Hill (VRH) approach [38–40]. Young's modulus Y is defined as the ratio of the stress to the strain, and it is used to provide a measurement of the stiffness of the solid. Larger the Young's modulus is, stiffer the material is. It can be calculated from B and G: (3) Y=9 B G 3 B + G
Poisson's ratio ν generally provides more information about the characteristic of the bonding forces than any of the other elastic moduli. It can be calculated by: (4) ν=3 B − 2 G 2 ( 3 B + G )
All the calculated results are listed in Table 1. The bulk modulus of ZAO is larger than that of ZAS, which indicates that ZAO is a relatively harder material. Pugh's criterion B/G with the critical value of 1.75 is used to estimate the ductile or brittle nature [41]. When B/G >1.75, the material is ductile and its hardness is lower, otherwise it behaves in a brittle manner. As can be seen from Table 1 the values of B/G are larger than 1.75 for both ZAO and ZAS, indicating that the two phases are ductile at ambient conditions and ZAO is stiffer than ZAS. The values of Poisson's ratio ν for covalent materials are small, i.e. ν=0.1, whereas for ionic materials a typical value of ν is 0.25. The calculated Poisson's ratios are close to 0.25, which means that both materials are with predominantly central inter–atomic forces [42]. Since larger Poisson's ratio is related with larger ductile, the results indicate that ZAO and ZAS have almost similar ductility. The Zener anisotropy factor A is an indicator of the degree of elastic anisotropy of one crystal and is calculated by [39]: (5) A=2 c 44 c 11 − c 12
For a completely isotropic material, the factor A takes the value of 1. It can be seen that ZAO and ZAS have anisotropic factors of 2.16 and 2.45, respectively, indicating that they are both strong anisotropic materials.

Phonon And Thermodynamic Properties:
The phonon dispersion curves and partial atomic phonon density of states (PhDOS) at the theoretical equilibrium volumes for ZAO and ZAS along several high–symmetry directions are presented in Fig. 2 a and b. The primitive cells of ZAO and ZAS contains 14 atoms, which gives rise to a total of 42 phonon branches, including 3 acoustic modes and 39 optical modes. There are no imaginary phonons for both materials in the Brillouin zone (BZ), indicating that they are dynamically stable. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the low–lying optical phonon modes have interaction with the acoustic phonon modes for ZAO and ZAS. For the PhDOS of ZAO, the acoustic modes are mainly dominated by the vibration of Zn atoms, while the optical modes are mainly contributed by the vibration of Al and O atoms, with more contribution from O than Al. In the case of ZAS, the acoustic modes also stem from Zn atoms, with a contribution of Al and S atoms for optical modes. Moreover, there is strong hybridization between Al and O/S atoms. ZAO has higher phonon energies than ZAS at the Γ point. The main difference between the two compounds is due to the fact that the chemical bonds in ZAO are stronger than ZAS and S atom is heavier than O atom.
The phonon modes at the Γ point for the space group Fd-3m are classified as [43]: Γ=A 1g(R) + E g(R) + T 1g + 3T 2g(R) + 2A 2u + 2E u + 4T 1u(IR) + 2T 2u. The subscripts u and g represent relatively symmetric modes and antisymmetric modes in antisymmetric center, E g and E u are double degenerate modes, while A g and A u are single degenerate modes. R and IR represent Raman and infrared active modes, and the others are inactive silent modes. Table 2 summarizes the phonon frequencies and symmetries of the vibrational modes at Γ point together with the referenced data. For ZAO, there is good agreement between the present results and other experimental or theoretical ones. The T 2g and T 1u mode are mainly contributed by Zn vibrations, while other modes are strongly influenced by Al and O/S vibrations. The major difference in the phonon frequencies of ZAO and ZAS can be accounted for the chemical bonds effects and atomic mass effects.
The Raman and infrared phonon frequencies at Γ point are presented in Table 3 . The Raman active T 2g frequencies for ZAO are 183, 480 and 574 cm−1, while for ZAS they are 135, 301 and 374 cm−1. The E g frequency is 399 cm−1 for ZAO and 229 cm−1 for ZAS. The calculated TO frequencies for ZAO are 210, 454, 524 and 625 cm−1, close to experimental data. While the LO frequencies are 221, 505, 619 and 792 cm−1. The reason for the difference between our work and other theoretical results may due to the different pseudopotentials and k–point sampling chosen in the calculations. The TO frequencies of ZAS are 136, 296, 335 and 395 cm−1, while the LO frequencies are 137, 309, 342 and 470 cm−1.
The thermodynamic properties including the Gibbs free energies G, entropies S and specific heats at constant pressure C P for ZAO and ZAS can be calculated by using the phonon model or Debye model. The Debye model including the Slater model, Dugdale–McDonald (DM) model and Vaschenko–Zubarev (VZ) model are used in this work [33,44,45].
The Gibbs free energy G of a given structure at volume V and temperature T can be represented by: (6) G ( V , T )=E 0 ( V ) + F vib ( V , T ) + F el ( V , T ) where E 0(V) is the static energy at 0 K which can be easily obtained from first–principles calculations, F vib(V, T) is the vibrational free energy of the lattice ions, F el (V, T) is the free energy due to thermal electronic contribution.
The vibrational free energy of a structure F vib can be calculated within the quasiharmonic approximation from phonon or Debye models. In phonon model, it can be derived from the phonon density of states [45]: (7) F vib ( T )=k B T ∫ 0 ∞ ln 2 sinh ℏ ω 2 k B T g ( ω ) ⅆ ω where ω is the phonon frequency and g(ω) is the phonon density of state (PhDOS). In Debye model, F vib is calculated as a function of Debye temperature Θ D [33]: (8) F vib ( V , T )=9 8 k B Θ D + k B { 3 ln [ 1 − exp ( − Θ D T ) − D ( Θ D T ) ] } where D ( x )=3 / x 3 ∫ 0 x t 3 / [ exp ( t ) − 1 ] ⅆ t is the Debye function.
Thermal electronic contribution to Gibbs free energy is determined by Mermin statistics F el=E el – TS el , and the internal energy at volume V and temperature T due to electronic excitations is given by [45]: (9) E el ( T )=∫ n ɛ f ɛ ⅆ ɛ − ∫ ɛ F n ɛ f ɛ ⅆ ɛ where n(ɛ) is the electronic DOS, ɛ the energy eigenvalues, ɛ F the energy at the Fermi level and f the Fermi distribution function.
The bare electronic entropy due to electronic excitations is written by [45]: (10) S el ( T )=− k B ∫ n ɛ f ln f + 1 − f ln 1 − f ⅆ ɛ
The results for ZAO and ZAS are presented in Figs. 3–5 . For Gibbs free energies in Fig. 3, it is found that the differences between the results obtained from phonon model and Debye model are quite small. Even at temperature of 1600K, the differences are less than 2 kJ mol−1 and 3 kJ mol−1 for ZAO and ZAS, respectively.
The entropy is an extensive state function which accounts for the effects of irreversibility in thermodynamic systems, and it can be defined as the change to a more disorder state at molecular level. From Fig. 4, entropies of ZAO are larger than that of ZAS at the same temperature, as the weaker chemical bonds in ZAO can cause the structure to a more disorder state than ZAS.
The specific heat at constant pressure C P is obtained based on the following equation: (11) C P=( ∂ H ∂ T ) P=C V ( 1 + γ t h α T ) where C V is the heat capacity at constant volume, α is the linear thermal expansion coefficient, γ t h is the thermodynamic Grüneisen ratio. Fig. 5 shows the specific heats at constant pressure for ZAO and ZAS as a function of temperature. The four lines match very well at low temperature (up to 300 K). The results from phonon model show that C P of ZAO and ZAS at 300 K are about 19 J mol−1·K−1 and 23 J mol−1·K−1, respectively. When the temperature is larger than 300 K, the results from phonon model become smaller than those from Debye model. There are few reported experimental results for the thermodynamic properties of ZAO and ZAS, our predicted results may be helpful for further works.

Conclusions:
First–principles calculations have been performed to investigate the structural, elastic and thermodynamic properties for ZAO and ZAS. The equilibrium structural parameters derived from E–V relationships are in good agreement with available experimental data, and the errors of lattice constants are about 1%. Both ZAO and ZAS are mechanically stable according to the stability criterion. The values of B/G and Poisson's ratios show that the two phases are slightly ductile. Phonon dispersions and phonon density of states indicate that both ZAO and ZAS are dynamically stable. The vibrational modes at the Γ point under zero pressure are analyzed, and there is good agreement for ZAO with other referenced data. The thermodynamic properties including the Gibbs free energies G, entropies S and specific heats C P for ZAO and ZAS are obtained on the basis of the first-principles E–V data together with quasiharmonic phonon or Debye models. Entropies of ZAO are larger than that of ZAS at the same temperature. The C P value of ZAO at 300 K from phonon model is about 19 J mol−1·K−1 and that of ZAS is about 23 J mol−1·K−1.

A large group of compounds with spinel structure are generally described by the AB2X4 formula, where A is divalent cation, B is a trivalent cation and X is a divalent anion. Compounds in this family usually have wide band gaps and are attractive in theory and experiments for better understanding of their physical properties [1–4]. In the normal spinel with cubic symmetry (space group Fd-3m), the A atoms occupy the center of tetrahedral sites and the B atoms occupy the center of octahedral sites. The main characteristic feature of spinel structure is the ability to host a wide range of divalent, trivalent, and tetravalent cations. ZnAl2O4 (ZAO) and ZnAl2S4 (ZAS) belong to this fascinating materials family.

At present, first–principles techniques have been demonstrated to be able to accurately describe the electronic structures, mechanical properties, optical and phonon spectra for different materials including ZAO [5–9]. Khenata et al. [10] studied the structural, electronic and elastic properties of ZAO using the full potential linear augmented plane wave (FP–LAPW) method as implemented in the WIEN97 code. In this approach the local density approximation (LDA) was used for the exchange–correlation (XC) potential. Sampath et al. [11] studied the electronic structure of ZAO by the self–consistent tight–binding linearized muffin–tin orbital method with the atomic sphere approximation. The vibrational properties and experimental data of phonon frequencies for ZAO are limited to the vicinity of the Γ point in the Brillouin zone (BZ) [5,12,13]. In the case of ZAS, there is relatively less experimental or theoretical research work [14]. For the understanding of elastic properties of a structure, first–principles derived elastic constants give quite satisfactory evaluation of the bulk modulus and shear modulus [15–17]. Furthermore, first–principles calculations together with the quasiharmonic approximation can accurately predict finite temperature thermodynamic properties of solids [18,19]. This approach provides reliable predictions of the thermodynamic properties especially when experimental information is lacking.

In this paper, we report first–principles calculations for the elastic, phonon and thermodynamic properties of ZAO and ZAS spinel. The crystal structures of ZAO and ZAS are firstly optimized, and the energy vs. volume (E–V) data are fitted by a four–parameter Birch–Murnaghan equation of state (EOS) [20]. Then the elastic constants and bulk elastic properties are derived; the ductility, brittleness and anisotropy of ZAO and ZAS are also discussed. The phonon dispersions and phonon density of states (PhDOS) at the theoretical equilibrium volumes are analyzed. Finally the thermodynamic properties including the Gibbs free energies, entropies and specific heats at constant pressure are predicted.

In this work the first–principles calculations for ZAO and ZAS are performed by Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code [21–23]. The electron–ion interactions are described by the full potential frozen–core projector augmented wave (PAW) [24] method, and the exchange–correlation is treated within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [25,26] of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) [27]. In VASP calculations, the wave functions are sampled on 11 × 11 × 11 k–point mesh based on Monkhorst–Pack [28] scheme together with the linear tetrahedron method including Blöchl corrections [29]. The energy cutoff of the wave function is 1.3 times as large as the maximum default value. The energy convergence criterion for electronic self–consistency is 10−6 eV/cell.

The Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) [30] is also used for the calculation of elastic properties. The ultrasoft pseudopotentials are used for all elements and the GGA with PBE functional is employed for the exchange correlation of electrons. The Monkhorst–Pack scheme k–points grid sampling is set as 2 × 2 × 2 in the Brillouin zone and the plane–wave energy cutoff is 310 eV. The convergence parameters are set as follows: total energy tolerance 10−5 eV/atom, force tolerance 0.03 eV/Å, maximum stress component 0.05 GPa and maximum displacement 0.001 Å.

The phonon properties of ZAO and ZAS are calculated by using the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [31] with 2 × 2 × 2 supercells. The displacement of 0.015 Å is adopted for each independent atom in the supercell in order to calculate the forces acting on the atoms. The phonon frequencies and phonon density of states (PhDOS) are obtained by PHONOPY [32] from the calculated dynamical matrix. By means of the phonon model and the Debye model, the thermodynamic properties of ZAO and ZAS, such as the Gibbs free energies, entropies and specific heats at constant pressure can be predicted [20,33].

The ZAO and ZAS compounds crystallize at ambient pressure in a diamond–type cubic spinel structure with space-group Fd-3m (227). The Zn atoms are located at the Wyckoff positions 8a (1/8, 1/8, 1/8) tetrahedral sites, while Al atoms are located at the 16d (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) octahedral sites and the O or S atoms are located at 32e (u, u, u) sites. In order to estimate the equilibrium structural properties including the energy E 0, bulk modulus B 0 and its pressure derivative B 0′ for ZAO and ZAS, the E–V relationships obtained from first–principles are fitted by a four–parameter Birch–Murnaghan (BM) equation of state (EOS), which is one of the most commonly used formula in the fitting of E–V data. It is the result of assuming a polynomial form of the energy [20]: (1) E ( f )=∑ k=0 n c k f k in terms of the finite Eulerian strains: (2) f=[ ( V r / V ) 2 / 3 − 1 ] / 2 where V r is a reference volume.

The E–V relationships for ZAO and ZAS are shown in Fig. 1 and fitted by the four-parameter BM EOS. The calculated equilibrium lattice constants are 8.179 and 10.086 Å, in good agreement with the experimental values of 8.086 Å [34] and 10.005 Å [35] for ZAO and ZAS, respectively. The errors of lattice constants are about 1%. The bulk modulus B 0 is 188 GPa and its pressure derivative B 0′ is 4.26 for ZAO, while for ZAS B 0 is 85 GPa and B 0′ is 4.42.

The elastic constants can be obtained by calculating the total energy as a function of applied strains which break the crystal symmetry. For cubic crystals, the three elastic constants c 11, c 12 and c 44 are calculated under the hydrostatic pressures e 1=(δ, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), e 2=(δ, δ, 0, 0, 0, 0) and e 3=(0, 0, 0, δ, 0, 0). Seven deformations 0%,±0.5%,±1% and±2% are applied to determine each elastic constant, and the systems are fully relaxed after each deformation in order to reach the equilibrium state. Then c 11, c 12 and c 44 can be obtained from the second–order fitting to the strain energy vs. strain relationships [36]. The obtained elastic constants are presented in Table 1 and are in good agreement with other referenced data. The results from VASP and CASTEP are close to each other, in particular for ZAS.

The mechanical stabilities of materials can be estimated from the stability criteria, and the criterion for cubic crystals is known to be c 11 > 0, c 44 > 0 and c 11-c 12 > 0. The elastic constants of ZAO and ZAS derived from different methods all satisfy this criterion, indicating that the two phases are both mechanically stable. Since the octahedra in ZAS are softer than those in ZAO due to the coupling between atomic displacements and shear strains, the resulted c 11, c 12 and c 44 values for ZAS are smaller than those of ZAO.

It is known that the plastic properties of materials are related with their elastic moduli. The bulk modulus B represents the resistance of a material against volume change under hydrostatic pressure, and the shear modulus G is the resistance to shape change caused by shearing force. The elastic moduli can be calculated by Voigt–Reuss–Hill (VRH) approach [38–40]. Young's modulus Y is defined as the ratio of the stress to the strain, and it is used to provide a measurement of the stiffness of the solid. Larger the Young's modulus is, stiffer the material is. It can be calculated from B and G: (3) Y=9 B G 3 B + G

Poisson's ratio ν generally provides more information about the characteristic of the bonding forces than any of the other elastic moduli. It can be calculated by: (4) ν=3 B − 2 G 2 ( 3 B + G )

All the calculated results are listed in Table 1. The bulk modulus of ZAO is larger than that of ZAS, which indicates that ZAO is a relatively harder material. Pugh's criterion B/G with the critical value of 1.75 is used to estimate the ductile or brittle nature [41]. When B/G >1.75, the material is ductile and its hardness is lower, otherwise it behaves in a brittle manner. As can be seen from Table 1 the values of B/G are larger than 1.75 for both ZAO and ZAS, indicating that the two phases are ductile at ambient conditions and ZAO is stiffer than ZAS. The values of Poisson's ratio ν for covalent materials are small, i.e. ν=0.1, whereas for ionic materials a typical value of ν is 0.25. The calculated Poisson's ratios are close to 0.25, which means that both materials are with predominantly central inter–atomic forces [42]. Since larger Poisson's ratio is related with larger ductile, the results indicate that ZAO and ZAS have almost similar ductility. The Zener anisotropy factor A is an indicator of the degree of elastic anisotropy of one crystal and is calculated by [39]: (5) A=2 c 44 c 11 − c 12

For a completely isotropic material, the factor A takes the value of 1. It can be seen that ZAO and ZAS have anisotropic factors of 2.16 and 2.45, respectively, indicating that they are both strong anisotropic materials.

The phonon dispersion curves and partial atomic phonon density of states (PhDOS) at the theoretical equilibrium volumes for ZAO and ZAS along several high–symmetry directions are presented in Fig. 2 a and b. The primitive cells of ZAO and ZAS contains 14 atoms, which gives rise to a total of 42 phonon branches, including 3 acoustic modes and 39 optical modes. There are no imaginary phonons for both materials in the Brillouin zone (BZ), indicating that they are dynamically stable. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the low–lying optical phonon modes have interaction with the acoustic phonon modes for ZAO and ZAS. For the PhDOS of ZAO, the acoustic modes are mainly dominated by the vibration of Zn atoms, while the optical modes are mainly contributed by the vibration of Al and O atoms, with more contribution from O than Al. In the case of ZAS, the acoustic modes also stem from Zn atoms, with a contribution of Al and S atoms for optical modes. Moreover, there is strong hybridization between Al and O/S atoms. ZAO has higher phonon energies than ZAS at the Γ point. The main difference between the two compounds is due to the fact that the chemical bonds in ZAO are stronger than ZAS and S atom is heavier than O atom.

The phonon modes at the Γ point for the space group Fd-3m are classified as [43]: Γ=A 1g(R) + E g(R) + T 1g + 3T 2g(R) + 2A 2u + 2E u + 4T 1u(IR) + 2T 2u. The subscripts u and g represent relatively symmetric modes and antisymmetric modes in antisymmetric center, E g and E u are double degenerate modes, while A g and A u are single degenerate modes. R and IR represent Raman and infrared active modes, and the others are inactive silent modes. Table 2 summarizes the phonon frequencies and symmetries of the vibrational modes at Γ point together with the referenced data. For ZAO, there is good agreement between the present results and other experimental or theoretical ones. The T 2g and T 1u mode are mainly contributed by Zn vibrations, while other modes are strongly influenced by Al and O/S vibrations. The major difference in the phonon frequencies of ZAO and ZAS can be accounted for the chemical bonds effects and atomic mass effects.

The Raman and infrared phonon frequencies at Γ point are presented in Table 3 . The Raman active T 2g frequencies for ZAO are 183, 480 and 574 cm−1, while for ZAS they are 135, 301 and 374 cm−1. The E g frequency is 399 cm−1 for ZAO and 229 cm−1 for ZAS. The calculated TO frequencies for ZAO are 210, 454, 524 and 625 cm−1, close to experimental data. While the LO frequencies are 221, 505, 619 and 792 cm−1. The reason for the difference between our work and other theoretical results may due to the different pseudopotentials and k–point sampling chosen in the calculations. The TO frequencies of ZAS are 136, 296, 335 and 395 cm−1, while the LO frequencies are 137, 309, 342 and 470 cm−1.

The thermodynamic properties including the Gibbs free energies G, entropies S and specific heats at constant pressure C P for ZAO and ZAS can be calculated by using the phonon model or Debye model. The Debye model including the Slater model, Dugdale–McDonald (DM) model and Vaschenko–Zubarev (VZ) model are used in this work [33,44,45].

The Gibbs free energy G of a given structure at volume V and temperature T can be represented by: (6) G ( V , T )=E 0 ( V ) + F vib ( V , T ) + F el ( V , T ) where E 0(V) is the static energy at 0 K which can be easily obtained from first–principles calculations, F vib(V, T) is the vibrational free energy of the lattice ions, F el (V, T) is the free energy due to thermal electronic contribution.

The vibrational free energy of a structure F vib can be calculated within the quasiharmonic approximation from phonon or Debye models. In phonon model, it can be derived from the phonon density of states [45]: (7) F vib ( T )=k B T ∫ 0 ∞ ln 2 sinh ℏ ω 2 k B T g ( ω ) ⅆ ω where ω is the phonon frequency and g(ω) is the phonon density of state (PhDOS). In Debye model, F vib is calculated as a function of Debye temperature Θ D [33]: (8) F vib ( V , T )=9 8 k B Θ D + k B { 3 ln [ 1 − exp ( − Θ D T ) − D ( Θ D T ) ] } where D ( x )=3 / x 3 ∫ 0 x t 3 / [ exp ( t ) − 1 ] ⅆ t is the Debye function.

Thermal electronic contribution to Gibbs free energy is determined by Mermin statistics F el=E el – TS el , and the internal energy at volume V and temperature T due to electronic excitations is given by [45]: (9) E el ( T )=∫ n ɛ f ɛ ⅆ ɛ − ∫ ɛ F n ɛ f ɛ ⅆ ɛ where n(ɛ) is the electronic DOS, ɛ the energy eigenvalues, ɛ F the energy at the Fermi level and f the Fermi distribution function.

The bare electronic entropy due to electronic excitations is written by [45]: (10) S el ( T )=− k B ∫ n ɛ f ln f + 1 − f ln 1 − f ⅆ ɛ

The results for ZAO and ZAS are presented in Figs. 3–5 . For Gibbs free energies in Fig. 3, it is found that the differences between the results obtained from phonon model and Debye model are quite small. Even at temperature of 1600K, the differences are less than 2 kJ mol−1 and 3 kJ mol−1 for ZAO and ZAS, respectively.

The entropy is an extensive state function which accounts for the effects of irreversibility in thermodynamic systems, and it can be defined as the change to a more disorder state at molecular level. From Fig. 4, entropies of ZAO are larger than that of ZAS at the same temperature, as the weaker chemical bonds in ZAO can cause the structure to a more disorder state than ZAS.

The specific heat at constant pressure C P is obtained based on the following equation: (11) C P=( ∂ H ∂ T ) P=C V ( 1 + γ t h α T ) where C V is the heat capacity at constant volume, α is the linear thermal expansion coefficient, γ t h is the thermodynamic Grüneisen ratio. Fig. 5 shows the specific heats at constant pressure for ZAO and ZAS as a function of temperature. The four lines match very well at low temperature (up to 300 K). The results from phonon model show that C P of ZAO and ZAS at 300 K are about 19 J mol−1·K−1 and 23 J mol−1·K−1, respectively. When the temperature is larger than 300 K, the results from phonon model become smaller than those from Debye model. There are few reported experimental results for the thermodynamic properties of ZAO and ZAS, our predicted results may be helpful for further works.

First–principles calculations have been performed to investigate the structural, elastic and thermodynamic properties for ZAO and ZAS. The equilibrium structural parameters derived from E–V relationships are in good agreement with available experimental data, and the errors of lattice constants are about 1%. Both ZAO and ZAS are mechanically stable according to the stability criterion. The values of B/G and Poisson's ratios show that the two phases are slightly ductile. Phonon dispersions and phonon density of states indicate that both ZAO and ZAS are dynamically stable. The vibrational modes at the Γ point under zero pressure are analyzed, and there is good agreement for ZAO with other referenced data. The thermodynamic properties including the Gibbs free energies G, entropies S and specific heats C P for ZAO and ZAS are obtained on the basis of the first-principles E–V data together with quasiharmonic phonon or Debye models. Entropies of ZAO are larger than that of ZAS at the same temperature. The C P value of ZAO at 300 K from phonon model is about 19 J mol−1·K−1 and that of ZAS is about 23 J mol−1·K−1.

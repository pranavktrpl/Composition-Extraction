Title:
Microstructure and mechanical properties of reaction bonded B

Abstract:
Reaction bonded B4C-SiC composites were prepared by infiltrating silicon melt into porous B4C-SiC green preforms at 1500°C in vacuum. The porous green preform was obtained from a mixture of polycarbosilane (PCS) and particle size graded B4C after pre-sintering at 1600°C. For the first time, PCS was used to adjust the phase composition and microstructure of the reaction bonded boron carbide composites. It is indicated that the addition of PCS and its content has a significant influence on the microstructure as well as the mechanical properties of the subsequent reaction bonded B4C-SiC composites. For the B4C-SiC composite with 5wt% PCS added, a flexural strength of 319±12MPa, and an elastic modulus of 402±18GPa can be achieved, which is 23% and 15% higher than those of the composite without PCS addition, respectively. While, with the higher content of PCS addition, the mechanical properties of the composites are decreased drastically due to the large amount of residual Si agglomeration in the composites. The reaction mechanisms as well as their microstructure evolution processes correlated with the mechanical properties of the reaction bonded B4C-SiC composites are further discussed in our work.

Introduction:
Recently, boron carbide has received extensive attention because of its unique physical properties such as extremely low density (2.52g/cm3), high hardness (~30GPa), high melting point (2450°C), high elastic modulus (~460GPa) and high neutron absorption cross section [1,2]. And it has been used in many advanced technological fields, such as light-wear armors, wear parts, nuclear materials, high-temperature thermoelectricity conversion materials, etc. [3,4]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the application of B4C ceramics as engineering materials has been limited due to their poor sinter ability and the high susceptibility to brittle failure caused by the B-C strong covalent bonding feature.
Both hot pressing and pressureless sintering have been employed for the densification of boron carbide based ceramics. However, extremely high temperature and sintering aids are generally required in these methods which cost high energy consumption and are not environment-friendly [5–9]. As an alternative method, reaction bonding technique is a promising route to fabricate dense boron carbide based ceramics at lower temperature (1450–1600°C) and achieve near net shaping [10–12]. Generally, reaction bonded boron carbide (RBBC) ceramics are obtained by infiltration molten metal such as silicon, aluminum, magnesium into a pre-sintered green preform with designed porous structure [13–16]. In the past few decades, many efforts have been taken to improve the properties of reaction bonded boron carbide ceramics. Barick et al. [10] investigated the effect of particle size on the mechanical properties of reaction bonded boron carbide ceramics. It was found that the hardness of RBBC composites was improved with the increment of starting particle size，while the flexural strength and fracture toughness were decreased with the growth in starting particle size. Recently, Thuault et al. [17] developed a novel processing of reaction bonded B4C–SiC composites in a single-mode microwave cavity, where good homogeneity of the samples was obtained. In addition, impurities in the initial materials, pore size distribution of green preforms and grain size distribution of reaction bonded boron carbide composites can affect the mechanical properties of the RBBC composites [18]. However, the existence of residual Si phase is the major drawback of the reaction bonded boron carbide composites because it is harmful to the mechanical properties. Graded B4C particles increase the density of green preform and improve the hardness, flexural strength, elastic modulus. Infiltration depth is influenced by the viscosity of melt, contact angle, pore radius and other impacts. Appropriate pore diameter is beneficial to the infiltration process and the improvement of infiltration depth [19]. Polycarbosilane (PCS) as SiC ceramic precursor has been used to fabricate fiber reinforced ceramic composites (CMCs), SiC fiber and nano structured ceramics. Recently, PCS was introduced into the hybrid powder to fabricate the B4C composites in hot process with the improving the ceramics density and mechanical properties [7].
In the present work, coarse boron carbide powder (D50: average particle size, 139.0µm) and fine boron carbide powder (D50=2.01µm) were employed as the raw material because particle size graded boron carbide can lower the porosity and increase the density of green preform. In this research, PCS was first added into the powder mixture to form hybrid powder and adjust the phase composition as well as microstructure of reaction bonded boron carbide composites. The effect of PCS content on the phase composition, microstructure of reaction bonding boron carbide materials, as well as the mechanical properties of materials were analyzed in detail in the following discussion.

Experimental Procedure:
2.1 Materials and processing Commercial boron carbide powder (98.5% purity, Mudanjiang Abrasive and Grinding Tools, China) with two different particle sizes (P140: D50=139.0µm; P2: D50=2.01µm), and polycarbosilane (PCS, average molecular weight is about 1400, National University of Defense Technology, 98.5% purity) were purchased as the initial materials. Four powder mixtures without and with 5wt%, 10wt% and 15wt% PCS addition were prepared, correspondingly named as RB1, RB2, RB3, RB4, respectively. For a better comparison, the ratio between P140 and P2 were fixed at 1.5. For RB1 mixture without PCS addition, 1.5wt% PVB (polyvinyl butyral) was added as the binder. And the mixtures were ball milled for 24h to get a uniform distribution with gasoline as solvent for RB2, RB3, RB4, while ethanol for RB1. After ball milling, the slurries were dried at 60°C in vacuum drying oven for 24h. 60-Mesh nylon sieve was employed to screen the resultant powder mixture. Then, compacts with a size of around 50×50×5mm3 were prepared by uniaxial pressing under 30MPa and followed by 200MPa cold isotactic pressing. The compacts were heat treated at 1100°C in Ar atmosphere for PCS pyrolysis employing the heating rate of 5°C/min and maintained at these temperature for 60mins, followed by pre-sintering at 1600°C/1h in vacuum with the heating rate of 10°C/min. Then, the porous B4C-SiC green preforms were infiltrated with silicon powder (99% purity, Chemical reagent co., LTD) at 1500°C in vacuum using the heating rate of 10°C/min with the dwell time of 60mins.
2.2 Characterization of microstructure and mechanical properties The component of PCS residual pyrolysed at 1600°C was measured by carbon and sulfur analyzer (ELTRA CS2000). Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement was conducted with 5°C/min heating rate in Ar atmosphere (Netzsch STA449C). The apparent density, median pore diameter of green preforms were obtained by intrusive mercury measurements (Auto pore IV 9510, Micromeritics Co., Ltd, USA). Archimedes methods are employed to measure the density and open porosity of the RBBC composites employing distilled water as the media. Flexural strength was tested via three point bending test on specimens (specimen size=3mm×4mm×36mm) with a span of 30mm and loading rate of 0.5mm/min by test machine (Model 5566, Instron company, UK). Fracture toughness was measured by the single-edge-notched beam (SENB) method on specimens with a span of 20mm (specimen size=2.5mm×5mm×36mm, notch width=0.2mm, notch depth=2.5mm, load speed=0.05mm/min). Five specimens were tested for each samples and the average values were displayed in this work. Besides, elasticity modulus was calculated by the formula E=L 3 / [ 4bh 3 ( Y 2 / P 2 − Y 1 / P 1 ) ] Where the L is the span, b is the width of the specimen, h is the height, Y2 is the maximum displacement, P2 is the maximum load, Y1 is the calibration of displacement, P1 is the calibration of load. The Vickers-hardness (Hv) was characterized at a load of 4.9 N with a dwelling time 10s on the polished ground surface (Tukon-2100B, Nastech Co., Ltd, Korea). Vickers-hardness (Hv) was tested at least 10 points and the average values were presented. X-ray diffraction technique (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2550V) was carried out to analyze the crystal phase composition, using Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.54056Å) with a step interval of 0.02° and a count time of 1s per step. The microstructure was studied by the scanning electron microscopy (S4800, Hitachi, Japan) with energy dispersive scanning (EDS, Bruker) and the transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2100F).

Materials And Processing:
Commercial boron carbide powder (98.5% purity, Mudanjiang Abrasive and Grinding Tools, China) with two different particle sizes (P140: D50=139.0µm; P2: D50=2.01µm), and polycarbosilane (PCS, average molecular weight is about 1400, National University of Defense Technology, 98.5% purity) were purchased as the initial materials. Four powder mixtures without and with 5wt%, 10wt% and 15wt% PCS addition were prepared, correspondingly named as RB1, RB2, RB3, RB4, respectively. For a better comparison, the ratio between P140 and P2 were fixed at 1.5. For RB1 mixture without PCS addition, 1.5wt% PVB (polyvinyl butyral) was added as the binder. And the mixtures were ball milled for 24h to get a uniform distribution with gasoline as solvent for RB2, RB3, RB4, while ethanol for RB1. After ball milling, the slurries were dried at 60°C in vacuum drying oven for 24h. 60-Mesh nylon sieve was employed to screen the resultant powder mixture. Then, compacts with a size of around 50×50×5mm3 were prepared by uniaxial pressing under 30MPa and followed by 200MPa cold isotactic pressing. The compacts were heat treated at 1100°C in Ar atmosphere for PCS pyrolysis employing the heating rate of 5°C/min and maintained at these temperature for 60mins, followed by pre-sintering at 1600°C/1h in vacuum with the heating rate of 10°C/min. Then, the porous B4C-SiC green preforms were infiltrated with silicon powder (99% purity, Chemical reagent co., LTD) at 1500°C in vacuum using the heating rate of 10°C/min with the dwell time of 60mins.

Characterization Of Microstructure And Mechanical Properties:
The component of PCS residual pyrolysed at 1600°C was measured by carbon and sulfur analyzer (ELTRA CS2000). Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement was conducted with 5°C/min heating rate in Ar atmosphere (Netzsch STA449C).

Besides, elasticity modulus was calculated by the formula E=L 3 / [ 4bh 3 ( Y 2 / P 2 − Y 1 / P 1 ) ] Where the L is the span, b is the width of the specimen, h is the height, Y2 is the maximum displacement, P2 is the maximum load, Y1 is the calibration of displacement, P1 is the calibration of load.

Results And Discussion:
3.1 Characterization of phase composition and microstructure To get a uniformly distributed pore structure in the green preforms, two types of B4C powder (P140 and P2) with different particle sizes were mixed together. The SEM images of the two B4C powder are exhibited in Fig. 1. It could be observed that both the coarse B4C powder and fine B4C powder display an irregular shape (sharp edges and corners) but with uniform particle size distribution. Corresponding particle size distribution of the two powders is displayed as the insets in the Fig. 1, which illustrates that the average particle sizes of the two powders are 139µm and 2.01µm, respectively. By calculating the weight of PCS before and after pyrolysis process, the mass fraction of PCS residual is about 62%. The residual of PCS comprise of 92.22wt% SiC and 7.78wt% free carbon. From the TG curves shown in Fig. 2, it can be seen that the mass loss is increased with the increment of PCS content. The mass loss of RB1 sample which is mainly caused by the pyrolysis of PVB binder, is about 1.7wt% and stops at temperature of about 500°C, indicating that the decomposition of PVB completes at this temperature. Compared to sample RB1, the mass loss and its stopping temperature of samples with PCS are both increasing. The values of sample RB2 and RB3 are 2.7wt% and 6.5wt%, respectively, and become stable at temperature of about 700°C. Si-H, C-H, Si-CH3 and other organic bonds were broken and the organic-inorganic transition process of PCS releases small gas liberation [20]. The higher mass loss caused by PCS pyrolysis leads to larger amount of pores and cracks in the green preforms, which influences the following sintering behavior. As described in the experiment parts, four different green preforms were prepared to study the effect of PCS addition and its content on the microstructure as well as the mechanical properties of the subsequent reaction bonded B4C-SiC composites. The phase assemblages of the green preforms heat treated at 1600°C/1h are depicted in Fig. 3. The XRD pattern of RB1 reveals that it only contains B4C phase, while the other samples consist of two phases, B4C phase and β-SiC phase. It is inferred that the β-SiC is derived from the yield of PCS pyrolysis [3]. However, no diffraction peaks of free carbon are observed in the XRD patterns due to low amount and non-crystalline state. Pore structure characterization of green preforms pre-sintered at 1600°C/1h are listed in Table 1. It is seen that the median pore diameter is drastically decreased with 5wt% PCS addition and then increased with increment of PCS content. It can be inferred that the large pores of green preforms are segmented by SiC particles and carbon particles from the PCS residual. Besides, the capillary force is described as Eq. (1), where γlv is the surface tension between liquid and air, θ is the wetting angle, Rc is the pore radius of the green preforms. RB2 has a lowest median pore diameter and this structure is beneficial to infiltration process because the capillary force is the driven force at infiltration process [21]. Fig. 4 also illustrates that RB4 green preform has some large pores which are formed due to the gas liberation during the pyrolysis process of PCS [20]. (1) Δ P=2 γ lv cos θ / Rc The fully dense reaction bonded boron carbide composites were obtained after infiltrating the silicon melt into the porous green preforms and pre-forming in-situ reaction at a lower temperature (1500°C). Fig. 5 presents the phase composition of RBBC composites. All the four samples contain the original B4C phase, SiC phase, residual Si and ternary B12(C,Si,B)3 phase. Among them, ternary B12(C,Si,B)3 phase is formed by the reaction between boron carbide and silicon. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the B12(C,Si,B)3 phase shows perceivable lattice swelling, on account of the observed shifts from the B12(C,Si,B)3 peaks to the main B4C peaks from Fig. 5(b) according to Bragg equation. The Si atoms inset into the linear chain and icosahedral unit of B4C units cell which are attributed to the perceivable lattice swelling [22]. Besides, it has been found that the relative intensity between the two silicon peaks (2θ~29° and 2θ~47°) is different. Test specimens which are employed in XRD test are machined by polishing and knifing. It can be inferred that the phenomenon is attributed to the preferred orientation of silicon phase in the different areas of the RBBC composites. Three possible sources can be responsible for the existence of SiC phase. From the analysis in Fig. 3, one source is the PCS residual after pre-sintering at 1600°C. Another source is that free carbon react with liquid silicon to form SiC phase according to Eq. (2). This reaction is of great importance in reaction bonded process which reduces residual silicon and increases the mechanical properties of reaction bonded boron carbide ceramics [11]. The third source is that B4C reacts with silicon to form SiC according to Eq. (3). Two main reaction mechanisms of B4C and Si have been reported by Phillip's work [22] and Hayun et al. [23,24]. In Phillip's work, the Si atoms are substituted for C atoms from C-B-C unit cells in B4C structure and then the C atoms react with molten silicon to form the SiC phase. Hayun et al. explained that B4C react with silicon by dissolution and precipitation mechanism in the process of the melting infiltration. (2) Si + C → SiC (3) Si + B 4 C → SiC + B 12 ( C , Si , B ) 3 The secondary electron micrographs of RBBC composites and EDS analysis of different areas are displayed in Fig. 6 (RB1). It can be found that the coarse B4C particles form a core-rim structure as shown in Fig. 6(a). Combining with the XRD results and EDS analysis, it can be elucidated that the newly formed equilibrium phase B12(C,Si,B)3 precipitates at the surface of initial coarse boron carbide particles and forms the rim region area. In addition, the rim consists of around 84.26at% B, 13.59at%C, 2.16at% Si while the core consist of 83.1at% B and 16.7at% Si. This reaction is strongly related to the reaction temperature and holding time, particularly for coarse B4C particles according to previous report [25]. In this work, the fine boron carbide particles are completely converted to ternary B12(C,Si,B)3 phase while large B4C particles are partly reacted, forming the core-rim structure. The mechanism of core-rim structure is explained by the dissolution-precipitation process which is attributed to “stoichiometric saturation” [23]. Fig. 7 shows the backscattered electron images of RBBC composites prepared from green preforms with different PCS content. SEM images reveal that all four samples are fully densified. As shown in Fig. 7, the B12(C,Si,B)3 phase is clearly distinguishable, which has a grey color slightly lighter than the B4C phase. The grey phase distributed in the residual silicon is β-SiC phase while the lighter area is residual silicon. It is very important to point out that the residual silicon phase provides the continuous composites skeleton and connect with the ceramic particles. By Comparing Fig. 7(b) with 7(a), it is seen that the volume fraction of grey area is higher. This phenomenon indicates that RB2 sample has the larger amount of SiC phase. With the higher content of PCS addition, it can be found that the residual silicon has accumulation area, as shown in Fig. 7(d). It should be pointed out that accumulation silicon area is located in the position of the large pores in RB4 green preform after melt infiltration. TEM analysis ( Fig. 8) is carried out to make us deeply understand the microstructure of reaction bonded boron carbide ceramics. Polygonal β-SiC grains are found in Fig. 8(a), indicating that the grains are formed by reaction between silicon and free carbon. The electron diffraction pattern shows typical single crystal electron diffraction pattern and it indicates that the elongated grain is β-SiC phase in Fig. 8(b). This phenomenon reveals that free carbon is insufficient in this reaction system because the plate-like β-SiC only can be found just in the absence of free carbon addition. Polished samples were etched in the HF-HNO3 mixed solution for 48h to study the composites phase and calculate the mass fraction of residual Si phase. The reaction of HF acid and residual Si phase can be described as follows: (4) Si ( s ) + 4HF ( l )=SiF 4 ( g ) + 2H 2 ( g ) This reaction is deflated and exothermic. The XRD patterns ( Fig. 9a) represent that all the residual silicon is removed after HF-HNO3 etching. The mass fraction of the residual Si of RBBC composites is presented in Fig. 9(b). According to the results, the mass fraction of the residual Si phase decreases drastically at first and then increases. In addition, RB2 composite has the lowest residual Si phase of 24.7wt% which acts as a positive role in increasing the mechanical properties. Fig. 10 exhibits the representative reaction bonded boron carbide composites after HF-HNO3 etching. It can be observed that the areas around the coarse B4C particles become a sort of porous structure after etching from Fig. 10. Besides, it suggests that the residual Si phase builds the continuous skeleton of reaction bonded boron carbide composites. Some large pores are observed in RB4 sample from Fig. 10(d) which are consistent with the result of the observation of RB4 sample before etching.
3.2 Mechanical properties of RBBC composites The mechanical properties of the RBBC composites processed with different PCS fraction are summarized in Table 2. Obviously, by comparing the values of different samples in the measurements, it can be found that RB2 has the lowest apparent porosity, highest density and optimal flexural strength of 0.217%, 2.539g/cm3, 319MPa, respectively. Notably, the flexural strength of RB1（260MPa）is 20% lower than that of RB2 sample, indicating that the addition of PCS has a significant effect on the mechanical properties. There are two main factors that affect the flexural strength including the porosity(P) and the flaw size according to the previous reports [26]. Generally, the relationship between strength and porosity can be described as Eq. (5) [27], where p is the porosity of ceramics, n is a constant related to the materials itself, σ0 is the flexural strength of the fully dense samples. According to Eq. (5), the highest flexural strength of RB2 can be explained by its lowest porosity. It can be inferred that the lowest porosity of RB2 may be ascribed to the good pore structure of RB2 green preform. (5) σ=σ 0 exp ( − np ) It can be seen that the RB4 sample displays the lowest flexural strength. Accumulation silicon area is observed in RB4 sample. Residual stress forms at weak interfacial zones during cooling process because of different CTEs between silicon (3.07×10−6/K) [26] and boron carbide (5.73×10−6/K) [1]. It can be inferred that RB4 composite may have the largest flaw size formation because of the residual Si agglomeration decreasing the mechanical properties of reaction bonded boron carbide composites [10]. The SEM images of the fracture surfaces of the four samples are shown in Fig. 11. It can be concluded that crack propagation and semi-ductile deformation of silicon are the main toughening mechanisms from the Fig. 11(b) [10,28]. And coarse boron carbide particles mainly display a transgranular cleavage fracture mode which can improve the mechanical properties of reaction bonded boron carbide ceramics. As shown in Fig. 12, crack deflection and crack bridging by the fine B4C particles can be seen in the crack propagation (RB2 sample). Also, SENB method is used to measure the toughness of RBBC composites. For comparison, the measurement is conducted on sample RB1 and sample RB2. The results indicate that the toughness values of RB1 and RB2 are almost the similar. It is 4.26±0.20MPam1/2 for RB1 and 4.35±0.05MPam1/2 for RB2. The Vickers-hardness values of different samples are listed in Table 2. It is well-known that there is a large distinction in the Vickers-hardness of different areas as a result of different microstructures and compositions. Two representative area were chosen to obtain a deep understanding of the hardness of RBBC composites including the regions of the fine boron carbide particles surrounded by the SiC phase and residual Si phase (area A) and the large boron carbide particles (area B). The average Vickers-hardness value of area B (RB2 sample) is 29.4±0.01GPa while the values of area A (RB2 sample) is 17.3±0.02GPa under the same test condition. The similar behaviors are found in other RBBC composites. Besides, all the RBBC composites exhibit the good property in hardness.

Characterization Of Phase Composition And Microstructure:
To get a uniformly distributed pore structure in the green preforms, two types of B4C powder (P140 and P2) with different particle sizes were mixed together. The SEM images of the two B4C powder are exhibited in Fig. 1. It could be observed that both the coarse B4C powder and fine B4C powder display an irregular shape (sharp edges and corners) but with uniform particle size distribution. Corresponding particle size distribution of the two powders is displayed as the insets in the Fig. 1, which illustrates that the average particle sizes of the two powders are 139µm and 2.01µm, respectively.
By calculating the weight of PCS before and after pyrolysis process, the mass fraction of PCS residual is about 62%. The residual of PCS comprise of 92.22wt% SiC and 7.78wt% free carbon. From the TG curves shown in Fig. 2, it can be seen that the mass loss is increased with the increment of PCS content. The mass loss of RB1 sample which is mainly caused by the pyrolysis of PVB binder, is about 1.7wt% and stops at temperature of about 500°C, indicating that the decomposition of PVB completes at this temperature. Compared to sample RB1, the mass loss and its stopping temperature of samples with PCS are both increasing. The values of sample RB2 and RB3 are 2.7wt% and 6.5wt%, respectively, and become stable at temperature of about 700°C. Si-H, C-H, Si-CH3 and other organic bonds were broken and the organic-inorganic transition process of PCS releases small gas liberation [20]. The higher mass loss caused by PCS pyrolysis leads to larger amount of pores and cracks in the green preforms, which influences the following sintering behavior.
As described in the experiment parts, four different green preforms were prepared to study the effect of PCS addition and its content on the microstructure as well as the mechanical properties of the subsequent reaction bonded B4C-SiC composites. The phase assemblages of the green preforms heat treated at 1600°C/1h are depicted in Fig. 3. The XRD pattern of RB1 reveals that it only contains B4C phase, while the other samples consist of two phases, B4C phase and β-SiC phase. It is inferred that the β-SiC is derived from the yield of PCS pyrolysis [3]. However, no diffraction peaks of free carbon are observed in the XRD patterns due to low amount and non-crystalline state.
Pore structure characterization of green preforms pre-sintered at 1600°C/1h are listed in Table 1. It is seen that the median pore diameter is drastically decreased with 5wt% PCS addition and then increased with increment of PCS content. It can be inferred that the large pores of green preforms are segmented by SiC particles and carbon particles from the PCS residual. Besides, the capillary force is described as Eq. (1), where γlv is the surface tension between liquid and air, θ is the wetting angle, Rc is the pore radius of the green preforms. RB2 has a lowest median pore diameter and this structure is beneficial to infiltration process because the capillary force is the driven force at infiltration process [21]. Fig. 4 also illustrates that RB4 green preform has some large pores which are formed due to the gas liberation during the pyrolysis process of PCS [20]. (1) Δ P=2 γ lv cos θ / Rc
The fully dense reaction bonded boron carbide composites were obtained after infiltrating the silicon melt into the porous green preforms and pre-forming in-situ reaction at a lower temperature (1500°C). Fig. 5 presents the phase composition of RBBC composites. All the four samples contain the original B4C phase, SiC phase, residual Si and ternary B12(C,Si,B)3 phase. Among them, ternary B12(C,Si,B)3 phase is formed by the reaction between boron carbide and silicon. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the B12(C,Si,B)3 phase shows perceivable lattice swelling, on account of the observed shifts from the B12(C,Si,B)3 peaks to the main B4C peaks from Fig. 5(b) according to Bragg equation. The Si atoms inset into the linear chain and icosahedral unit of B4C units cell which are attributed to the perceivable lattice swelling [22]. Besides, it has been found that the relative intensity between the two silicon peaks (2θ~29° and 2θ~47°) is different. Test specimens which are employed in XRD test are machined by polishing and knifing. It can be inferred that the phenomenon is attributed to the preferred orientation of silicon phase in the different areas of the RBBC composites.
Three possible sources can be responsible for the existence of SiC phase. From the analysis in Fig. 3, one source is the PCS residual after pre-sintering at 1600°C. Another source is that free carbon react with liquid silicon to form SiC phase according to Eq. (2). This reaction is of great importance in reaction bonded process which reduces residual silicon and increases the mechanical properties of reaction bonded boron carbide ceramics [11]. The third source is that B4C reacts with silicon to form SiC according to Eq. (3). Two main reaction mechanisms of B4C and Si have been reported by Phillip's work [22] and Hayun et al. [23,24]. In Phillip's work, the Si atoms are substituted for C atoms from C-B-C unit cells in B4C structure and then the C atoms react with molten silicon to form the SiC phase. Hayun et al. explained that B4C react with silicon by dissolution and precipitation mechanism in the process of the melting infiltration. (2) Si + C → SiC (3) Si + B 4 C → SiC + B 12 ( C , Si , B ) 3
The secondary electron micrographs of RBBC composites and EDS analysis of different areas are displayed in Fig. 6 (RB1). It can be found that the coarse B4C particles form a core-rim structure as shown in Fig. 6(a). Combining with the XRD results and EDS analysis, it can be elucidated that the newly formed equilibrium phase B12(C,Si,B)3 precipitates at the surface of initial coarse boron carbide particles and forms the rim region area. In addition, the rim consists of around 84.26at% B, 13.59at%C, 2.16at% Si while the core consist of 83.1at% B and 16.7at% Si. This reaction is strongly related to the reaction temperature and holding time, particularly for coarse B4C particles according to previous report [25]. In this work, the fine boron carbide particles are completely converted to ternary B12(C,Si,B)3 phase while large B4C particles are partly reacted, forming the core-rim structure. The mechanism of core-rim structure is explained by the dissolution-precipitation process which is attributed to “stoichiometric saturation” [23].
Fig. 7 shows the backscattered electron images of RBBC composites prepared from green preforms with different PCS content. SEM images reveal that all four samples are fully densified. As shown in Fig. 7, the B12(C,Si,B)3 phase is clearly distinguishable, which has a grey color slightly lighter than the B4C phase. The grey phase distributed in the residual silicon is β-SiC phase while the lighter area is residual silicon. It is very important to point out that the residual silicon phase provides the continuous composites skeleton and connect with the ceramic particles. By Comparing Fig. 7(b) with 7(a), it is seen that the volume fraction of grey area is higher. This phenomenon indicates that RB2 sample has the larger amount of SiC phase. With the higher content of PCS addition, it can be found that the residual silicon has accumulation area, as shown in Fig. 7(d). It should be pointed out that accumulation silicon area is located in the position of the large pores in RB4 green preform after melt infiltration.
TEM analysis ( Fig. 8) is carried out to make us deeply understand the microstructure of reaction bonded boron carbide ceramics. Polygonal β-SiC grains are found in Fig. 8(a), indicating that the grains are formed by reaction between silicon and free carbon. The electron diffraction pattern shows typical single crystal electron diffraction pattern and it indicates that the elongated grain is β-SiC phase in Fig. 8(b). This phenomenon reveals that free carbon is insufficient in this reaction system because the plate-like β-SiC only can be found just in the absence of free carbon addition.
Polished samples were etched in the HF-HNO3 mixed solution for 48h to study the composites phase and calculate the mass fraction of residual Si phase. The reaction of HF acid and residual Si phase can be described as follows: (4) Si ( s ) + 4HF ( l )=SiF 4 ( g ) + 2H 2 ( g )
This reaction is deflated and exothermic. The XRD patterns ( Fig. 9a) represent that all the residual silicon is removed after HF-HNO3 etching. The mass fraction of the residual Si of RBBC composites is presented in Fig. 9(b). According to the results, the mass fraction of the residual Si phase decreases drastically at first and then increases. In addition, RB2 composite has the lowest residual Si phase of 24.7wt% which acts as a positive role in increasing the mechanical properties. Fig. 10 exhibits the representative reaction bonded boron carbide composites after HF-HNO3 etching. It can be observed that the areas around the coarse B4C particles become a sort of porous structure after etching from Fig. 10. Besides, it suggests that the residual Si phase builds the continuous skeleton of reaction bonded boron carbide composites. Some large pores are observed in RB4 sample from Fig. 10(d) which are consistent with the result of the observation of RB4 sample before etching.

Mechanical Properties Of Rbbc Composites:
The mechanical properties of the RBBC composites processed with different PCS fraction are summarized in Table 2. Obviously, by comparing the values of different samples in the measurements, it can be found that RB2 has the lowest apparent porosity, highest density and optimal flexural strength of 0.217%, 2.539g/cm3, 319MPa, respectively. Notably, the flexural strength of RB1（260MPa）is 20% lower than that of RB2 sample, indicating that the addition of PCS has a significant effect on the mechanical properties.
There are two main factors that affect the flexural strength including the porosity(P) and the flaw size according to the previous reports [26]. Generally, the relationship between strength and porosity can be described as Eq. (5) [27], where p is the porosity of ceramics, n is a constant related to the materials itself, σ0 is the flexural strength of the fully dense samples. According to Eq. (5), the highest flexural strength of RB2 can be explained by its lowest porosity. It can be inferred that the lowest porosity of RB2 may be ascribed to the good pore structure of RB2 green preform. (5) σ=σ 0 exp ( − np )
It can be seen that the RB4 sample displays the lowest flexural strength. Accumulation silicon area is observed in RB4 sample. Residual stress forms at weak interfacial zones during cooling process because of different CTEs between silicon (3.07×10−6/K) [26] and boron carbide (5.73×10−6/K) [1]. It can be inferred that RB4 composite may have the largest flaw size formation because of the residual Si agglomeration decreasing the mechanical properties of reaction bonded boron carbide composites [10].
The SEM images of the fracture surfaces of the four samples are shown in Fig. 11. It can be concluded that crack propagation and semi-ductile deformation of silicon are the main toughening mechanisms from the Fig. 11(b) [10,28]. And coarse boron carbide particles mainly display a transgranular cleavage fracture mode which can improve the mechanical properties of reaction bonded boron carbide ceramics. As shown in Fig. 12, crack deflection and crack bridging by the fine B4C particles can be seen in the crack propagation (RB2 sample). Also, SENB method is used to measure the toughness of RBBC composites. For comparison, the measurement is conducted on sample RB1 and sample RB2. The results indicate that the toughness values of RB1 and RB2 are almost the similar. It is 4.26±0.20MPam1/2 for RB1 and 4.35±0.05MPam1/2 for RB2.
The Vickers-hardness values of different samples are listed in Table 2. It is well-known that there is a large distinction in the Vickers-hardness of different areas as a result of different microstructures and compositions. Two representative area were chosen to obtain a deep understanding of the hardness of RBBC composites including the regions of the fine boron carbide particles surrounded by the SiC phase and residual Si phase (area A) and the large boron carbide particles (area B). The average Vickers-hardness value of area B (RB2 sample) is 29.4±0.01GPa while the values of area A (RB2 sample) is 17.3±0.02GPa under the same test condition. The similar behaviors are found in other RBBC composites. Besides, all the RBBC composites exhibit the good property in hardness.

Conclusion:
In the present work, fully dense reaction bonded boron carbide composites were fabricated by infiltrating silicon melt into porous preforms employed the mixtures of graded B4C particles and polycarbosilane. The PCS addition was firstly used to adjust the microstructure of green preforms. The pore diameter of the green preforms is decreased initially and then increased with the increment of PCS content. For the green preform with 5wt% PCS addition, the pore diameter is 784.1nm and the highest apparent density is 2.53g/ml, respectively. After molten silicon infiltration, RBBC composites consist of four phase including boron carbide, B12(C,Si,B)3, β-SiC and residual silicon phase. Besides, core-rim structure is observed. And crack propagation and semi-ductile deformation of silicon are the main toughening mechanisms of the reaction bonded boron carbide composites. The mechanical properties of B4C-SiC composites are increased initially and then deteriorated with the increment of PCS content due to the microstructure and composition variation. For the B4C-SiC composite with 5wt% PCS added, a flexural strength, elastic modulus and hardness of 319±12MPa, 402±18GPa and 17.3±0.2GPa can be obtained, respectively.

Body:
Recently, boron carbide has received extensive attention because of its unique physical properties such as extremely low density (2.52g/cm3), high hardness (~30GPa), high melting point (2450°C), high elastic modulus (~460GPa) and high neutron absorption cross section [1,2]. And it has been used in many advanced technological fields, such as light-wear armors, wear parts, nuclear materials, high-temperature thermoelectricity conversion materials, etc. [3,4]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the application of B4C ceramics as engineering materials has been limited due to their poor sinter ability and the high susceptibility to brittle failure caused by the B-C strong covalent bonding feature.

Both hot pressing and pressureless sintering have been employed for the densification of boron carbide based ceramics. However, extremely high temperature and sintering aids are generally required in these methods which cost high energy consumption and are not environment-friendly [5–9]. As an alternative method, reaction bonding technique is a promising route to fabricate dense boron carbide based ceramics at lower temperature (1450–1600°C) and achieve near net shaping [10–12]. Generally, reaction bonded boron carbide (RBBC) ceramics are obtained by infiltration molten metal such as silicon, aluminum, magnesium into a pre-sintered green preform with designed porous structure [13–16]. In the past few decades, many efforts have been taken to improve the properties of reaction bonded boron carbide ceramics. Barick et al. [10] investigated the effect of particle size on the mechanical properties of reaction bonded boron carbide ceramics. It was found that the hardness of RBBC composites was improved with the increment of starting particle size，while the flexural strength and fracture toughness were decreased with the growth in starting particle size. Recently, Thuault et al. [17] developed a novel processing of reaction bonded B4C–SiC composites in a single-mode microwave cavity, where good homogeneity of the samples was obtained. In addition, impurities in the initial materials, pore size distribution of green preforms and grain size distribution of reaction bonded boron carbide composites can affect the mechanical properties of the RBBC composites [18]. However, the existence of residual Si phase is the major drawback of the reaction bonded boron carbide composites because it is harmful to the mechanical properties. Graded B4C particles increase the density of green preform and improve the hardness, flexural strength, elastic modulus. Infiltration depth is influenced by the viscosity of melt, contact angle, pore radius and other impacts. Appropriate pore diameter is beneficial to the infiltration process and the improvement of infiltration depth [19]. Polycarbosilane (PCS) as SiC ceramic precursor has been used to fabricate fiber reinforced ceramic composites (CMCs), SiC fiber and nano structured ceramics. Recently, PCS was introduced into the hybrid powder to fabricate the B4C composites in hot process with the improving the ceramics density and mechanical properties [7].

In the present work, coarse boron carbide powder (D50: average particle size, 139.0µm) and fine boron carbide powder (D50=2.01µm) were employed as the raw material because particle size graded boron carbide can lower the porosity and increase the density of green preform. In this research, PCS was first added into the powder mixture to form hybrid powder and adjust the phase composition as well as microstructure of reaction bonded boron carbide composites. The effect of PCS content on the phase composition, microstructure of reaction bonding boron carbide materials, as well as the mechanical properties of materials were analyzed in detail in the following discussion.

Commercial boron carbide powder (98.5% purity, Mudanjiang Abrasive and Grinding Tools, China) with two different particle sizes (P140: D50=139.0µm; P2: D50=2.01µm), and polycarbosilane (PCS, average molecular weight is about 1400, National University of Defense Technology, 98.5% purity) were purchased as the initial materials. Four powder mixtures without and with 5wt%, 10wt% and 15wt% PCS addition were prepared, correspondingly named as RB1, RB2, RB3, RB4, respectively. For a better comparison, the ratio between P140 and P2 were fixed at 1.5. For RB1 mixture without PCS addition, 1.5wt% PVB (polyvinyl butyral) was added as the binder. And the mixtures were ball milled for 24h to get a uniform distribution with gasoline as solvent for RB2, RB3, RB4, while ethanol for RB1. After ball milling, the slurries were dried at 60°C in vacuum drying oven for 24h. 60-Mesh nylon sieve was employed to screen the resultant powder mixture. Then, compacts with a size of around 50×50×5mm3 were prepared by uniaxial pressing under 30MPa and followed by 200MPa cold isotactic pressing. The compacts were heat treated at 1100°C in Ar atmosphere for PCS pyrolysis employing the heating rate of 5°C/min and maintained at these temperature for 60mins, followed by pre-sintering at 1600°C/1h in vacuum with the heating rate of 10°C/min. Then, the porous B4C-SiC green preforms were infiltrated with silicon powder (99% purity, Chemical reagent co., LTD) at 1500°C in vacuum using the heating rate of 10°C/min with the dwell time of 60mins.

The component of PCS residual pyrolysed at 1600°C was measured by carbon and sulfur analyzer (ELTRA CS2000). Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement was conducted with 5°C/min heating rate in Ar atmosphere (Netzsch STA449C). The apparent density, median pore diameter of green preforms were obtained by intrusive mercury measurements (Auto pore IV 9510, Micromeritics Co., Ltd, USA). Archimedes methods are employed to measure the density and open porosity of the RBBC composites employing distilled water as the media. Flexural strength was tested via three point bending test on specimens (specimen size=3mm×4mm×36mm) with a span of 30mm and loading rate of 0.5mm/min by test machine (Model 5566, Instron company, UK). Fracture toughness was measured by the single-edge-notched beam (SENB) method on specimens with a span of 20mm (specimen size=2.5mm×5mm×36mm, notch width=0.2mm, notch depth=2.5mm, load speed=0.05mm/min). Five specimens were tested for each samples and the average values were displayed in this work. Besides, elasticity modulus was calculated by the formula E=L 3 / [ 4bh 3 ( Y 2 / P 2 − Y 1 / P 1 ) ] Where the L is the span, b is the width of the specimen, h is the height, Y2 is the maximum displacement, P2 is the maximum load, Y1 is the calibration of displacement, P1 is the calibration of load. The Vickers-hardness (Hv) was characterized at a load of 4.9 N with a dwelling time 10s on the polished ground surface (Tukon-2100B, Nastech Co., Ltd, Korea). Vickers-hardness (Hv) was tested at least 10 points and the average values were presented. X-ray diffraction technique (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2550V) was carried out to analyze the crystal phase composition, using Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.54056Å) with a step interval of 0.02° and a count time of 1s per step. The microstructure was studied by the scanning electron microscopy (S4800, Hitachi, Japan) with energy dispersive scanning (EDS, Bruker) and the transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2100F).

To get a uniformly distributed pore structure in the green preforms, two types of B4C powder (P140 and P2) with different particle sizes were mixed together. The SEM images of the two B4C powder are exhibited in Fig. 1. It could be observed that both the coarse B4C powder and fine B4C powder display an irregular shape (sharp edges and corners) but with uniform particle size distribution. Corresponding particle size distribution of the two powders is displayed as the insets in the Fig. 1, which illustrates that the average particle sizes of the two powders are 139µm and 2.01µm, respectively.

By calculating the weight of PCS before and after pyrolysis process, the mass fraction of PCS residual is about 62%. The residual of PCS comprise of 92.22wt% SiC and 7.78wt% free carbon. From the TG curves shown in Fig. 2, it can be seen that the mass loss is increased with the increment of PCS content. The mass loss of RB1 sample which is mainly caused by the pyrolysis of PVB binder, is about 1.7wt% and stops at temperature of about 500°C, indicating that the decomposition of PVB completes at this temperature. Compared to sample RB1, the mass loss and its stopping temperature of samples with PCS are both increasing. The values of sample RB2 and RB3 are 2.7wt% and 6.5wt%, respectively, and become stable at temperature of about 700°C. Si-H, C-H, Si-CH3 and other organic bonds were broken and the organic-inorganic transition process of PCS releases small gas liberation [20]. The higher mass loss caused by PCS pyrolysis leads to larger amount of pores and cracks in the green preforms, which influences the following sintering behavior.

As described in the experiment parts, four different green preforms were prepared to study the effect of PCS addition and its content on the microstructure as well as the mechanical properties of the subsequent reaction bonded B4C-SiC composites. The phase assemblages of the green preforms heat treated at 1600°C/1h are depicted in Fig. 3. The XRD pattern of RB1 reveals that it only contains B4C phase, while the other samples consist of two phases, B4C phase and β-SiC phase. It is inferred that the β-SiC is derived from the yield of PCS pyrolysis [3]. However, no diffraction peaks of free carbon are observed in the XRD patterns due to low amount and non-crystalline state.

Pore structure characterization of green preforms pre-sintered at 1600°C/1h are listed in Table 1. It is seen that the median pore diameter is drastically decreased with 5wt% PCS addition and then increased with increment of PCS content. It can be inferred that the large pores of green preforms are segmented by SiC particles and carbon particles from the PCS residual. Besides, the capillary force is described as Eq. (1), where γlv is the surface tension between liquid and air, θ is the wetting angle, Rc is the pore radius of the green preforms. RB2 has a lowest median pore diameter and this structure is beneficial to infiltration process because the capillary force is the driven force at infiltration process [21]. Fig. 4 also illustrates that RB4 green preform has some large pores which are formed due to the gas liberation during the pyrolysis process of PCS [20]. (1) Δ P=2 γ lv cos θ / Rc

The fully dense reaction bonded boron carbide composites were obtained after infiltrating the silicon melt into the porous green preforms and pre-forming in-situ reaction at a lower temperature (1500°C). Fig. 5 presents the phase composition of RBBC composites. All the four samples contain the original B4C phase, SiC phase, residual Si and ternary B12(C,Si,B)3 phase. Among them, ternary B12(C,Si,B)3 phase is formed by the reaction between boron carbide and silicon. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the B12(C,Si,B)3 phase shows perceivable lattice swelling, on account of the observed shifts from the B12(C,Si,B)3 peaks to the main B4C peaks from Fig. 5(b) according to Bragg equation. The Si atoms inset into the linear chain and icosahedral unit of B4C units cell which are attributed to the perceivable lattice swelling [22]. Besides, it has been found that the relative intensity between the two silicon peaks (2θ~29° and 2θ~47°) is different. Test specimens which are employed in XRD test are machined by polishing and knifing. It can be inferred that the phenomenon is attributed to the preferred orientation of silicon phase in the different areas of the RBBC composites.

Three possible sources can be responsible for the existence of SiC phase. From the analysis in Fig. 3, one source is the PCS residual after pre-sintering at 1600°C. Another source is that free carbon react with liquid silicon to form SiC phase according to Eq. (2). This reaction is of great importance in reaction bonded process which reduces residual silicon and increases the mechanical properties of reaction bonded boron carbide ceramics [11]. The third source is that B4C reacts with silicon to form SiC according to Eq. (3). Two main reaction mechanisms of B4C and Si have been reported by Phillip's work [22] and Hayun et al. [23,24]. In Phillip's work, the Si atoms are substituted for C atoms from C-B-C unit cells in B4C structure and then the C atoms react with molten silicon to form the SiC phase. Hayun et al. explained that B4C react with silicon by dissolution and precipitation mechanism in the process of the melting infiltration. (2) Si + C → SiC (3) Si + B 4 C → SiC + B 12 ( C , Si , B ) 3

The secondary electron micrographs of RBBC composites and EDS analysis of different areas are displayed in Fig. 6 (RB1). It can be found that the coarse B4C particles form a core-rim structure as shown in Fig. 6(a). Combining with the XRD results and EDS analysis, it can be elucidated that the newly formed equilibrium phase B12(C,Si,B)3 precipitates at the surface of initial coarse boron carbide particles and forms the rim region area. In addition, the rim consists of around 84.26at% B, 13.59at%C, 2.16at% Si while the core consist of 83.1at% B and 16.7at% Si. This reaction is strongly related to the reaction temperature and holding time, particularly for coarse B4C particles according to previous report [25]. In this work, the fine boron carbide particles are completely converted to ternary B12(C,Si,B)3 phase while large B4C particles are partly reacted, forming the core-rim structure. The mechanism of core-rim structure is explained by the dissolution-precipitation process which is attributed to “stoichiometric saturation” [23].

Fig. 7 shows the backscattered electron images of RBBC composites prepared from green preforms with different PCS content. SEM images reveal that all four samples are fully densified. As shown in Fig. 7, the B12(C,Si,B)3 phase is clearly distinguishable, which has a grey color slightly lighter than the B4C phase. The grey phase distributed in the residual silicon is β-SiC phase while the lighter area is residual silicon. It is very important to point out that the residual silicon phase provides the continuous composites skeleton and connect with the ceramic particles. By Comparing Fig. 7(b) with 7(a), it is seen that the volume fraction of grey area is higher. This phenomenon indicates that RB2 sample has the larger amount of SiC phase. With the higher content of PCS addition, it can be found that the residual silicon has accumulation area, as shown in Fig. 7(d). It should be pointed out that accumulation silicon area is located in the position of the large pores in RB4 green preform after melt infiltration.

TEM analysis ( Fig. 8) is carried out to make us deeply understand the microstructure of reaction bonded boron carbide ceramics. Polygonal β-SiC grains are found in Fig. 8(a), indicating that the grains are formed by reaction between silicon and free carbon. The electron diffraction pattern shows typical single crystal electron diffraction pattern and it indicates that the elongated grain is β-SiC phase in Fig. 8(b). This phenomenon reveals that free carbon is insufficient in this reaction system because the plate-like β-SiC only can be found just in the absence of free carbon addition.

Polished samples were etched in the HF-HNO3 mixed solution for 48h to study the composites phase and calculate the mass fraction of residual Si phase. The reaction of HF acid and residual Si phase can be described as follows: (4) Si ( s ) + 4HF ( l )=SiF 4 ( g ) + 2H 2 ( g )

This reaction is deflated and exothermic. The XRD patterns ( Fig. 9a) represent that all the residual silicon is removed after HF-HNO3 etching. The mass fraction of the residual Si of RBBC composites is presented in Fig. 9(b). According to the results, the mass fraction of the residual Si phase decreases drastically at first and then increases. In addition, RB2 composite has the lowest residual Si phase of 24.7wt% which acts as a positive role in increasing the mechanical properties. Fig. 10 exhibits the representative reaction bonded boron carbide composites after HF-HNO3 etching. It can be observed that the areas around the coarse B4C particles become a sort of porous structure after etching from Fig. 10. Besides, it suggests that the residual Si phase builds the continuous skeleton of reaction bonded boron carbide composites. Some large pores are observed in RB4 sample from Fig. 10(d) which are consistent with the result of the observation of RB4 sample before etching.

The mechanical properties of the RBBC composites processed with different PCS fraction are summarized in Table 2. Obviously, by comparing the values of different samples in the measurements, it can be found that RB2 has the lowest apparent porosity, highest density and optimal flexural strength of 0.217%, 2.539g/cm3, 319MPa, respectively. Notably, the flexural strength of RB1（260MPa）is 20% lower than that of RB2 sample, indicating that the addition of PCS has a significant effect on the mechanical properties.

There are two main factors that affect the flexural strength including the porosity(P) and the flaw size according to the previous reports [26]. Generally, the relationship between strength and porosity can be described as Eq. (5) [27], where p is the porosity of ceramics, n is a constant related to the materials itself, σ0 is the flexural strength of the fully dense samples. According to Eq. (5), the highest flexural strength of RB2 can be explained by its lowest porosity. It can be inferred that the lowest porosity of RB2 may be ascribed to the good pore structure of RB2 green preform. (5) σ=σ 0 exp ( − np )

It can be seen that the RB4 sample displays the lowest flexural strength. Accumulation silicon area is observed in RB4 sample. Residual stress forms at weak interfacial zones during cooling process because of different CTEs between silicon (3.07×10−6/K) [26] and boron carbide (5.73×10−6/K) [1]. It can be inferred that RB4 composite may have the largest flaw size formation because of the residual Si agglomeration decreasing the mechanical properties of reaction bonded boron carbide composites [10].

The SEM images of the fracture surfaces of the four samples are shown in Fig. 11. It can be concluded that crack propagation and semi-ductile deformation of silicon are the main toughening mechanisms from the Fig. 11(b) [10,28]. And coarse boron carbide particles mainly display a transgranular cleavage fracture mode which can improve the mechanical properties of reaction bonded boron carbide ceramics. As shown in Fig. 12, crack deflection and crack bridging by the fine B4C particles can be seen in the crack propagation (RB2 sample). Also, SENB method is used to measure the toughness of RBBC composites. For comparison, the measurement is conducted on sample RB1 and sample RB2. The results indicate that the toughness values of RB1 and RB2 are almost the similar. It is 4.26±0.20MPam1/2 for RB1 and 4.35±0.05MPam1/2 for RB2.

The Vickers-hardness values of different samples are listed in Table 2. It is well-known that there is a large distinction in the Vickers-hardness of different areas as a result of different microstructures and compositions. Two representative area were chosen to obtain a deep understanding of the hardness of RBBC composites including the regions of the fine boron carbide particles surrounded by the SiC phase and residual Si phase (area A) and the large boron carbide particles (area B). The average Vickers-hardness value of area B (RB2 sample) is 29.4±0.01GPa while the values of area A (RB2 sample) is 17.3±0.02GPa under the same test condition. The similar behaviors are found in other RBBC composites. Besides, all the RBBC composites exhibit the good property in hardness.

In the present work, fully dense reaction bonded boron carbide composites were fabricated by infiltrating silicon melt into porous preforms employed the mixtures of graded B4C particles and polycarbosilane. The PCS addition was firstly used to adjust the microstructure of green preforms. The pore diameter of the green preforms is decreased initially and then increased with the increment of PCS content. For the green preform with 5wt% PCS addition, the pore diameter is 784.1nm and the highest apparent density is 2.53g/ml, respectively. After molten silicon infiltration, RBBC composites consist of four phase including boron carbide, B12(C,Si,B)3, β-SiC and residual silicon phase. Besides, core-rim structure is observed. And crack propagation and semi-ductile deformation of silicon are the main toughening mechanisms of the reaction bonded boron carbide composites. The mechanical properties of B4C-SiC composites are increased initially and then deteriorated with the increment of PCS content due to the microstructure and composition variation. For the B4C-SiC composite with 5wt% PCS added, a flexural strength, elastic modulus and hardness of 319±12MPa, 402±18GPa and 17.3±0.2GPa can be obtained, respectively.

Title:
Structural  mechanical and opto-thermal properties of non-crystalline Sb

Abstract:
Sb x O y oxides thin films have been prepared on glass substrates by a heat treatment of Sb thermal evaporated thin films in air atmosphere. X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the films annealed at Tr=550°C are well constituted of the Sb2O4 orthorhombic phase with elements oriented preferentially towards (004) direction. In the same way, from the optical transmission T(λ) and reflection R(λ) curves, the study of the absorption coefficient of these films versus incident energy revealed that the value of the band gap energy of Sb2O4 oxide is of the order of 3.9eV. Mechanical and opto-thermal original investigations confirmed the annealing temperature-related enhancement of the fabricated layers.

Introduction:
Antimony oxides Sb x O y are important oxides which have been investigated for their numerous applications. Among them Sb2O3 and Sb2O4 which have a high-efficiency flame-retardant synergist power in plastics, paints and could be used with other oxides as a catalyst for hydrocarbon cracking and hydrogen reduction, and in the production of ceramic enamels [1,2]. Also, they are used as wonderful ultraviolet filters for interferometric applications and present extended infrared transmission [3–5].
Moreover, their band gap energy larger than 3eV makes them suitable as attractive materials in optoelectronic application. Materials of Sb oxides have been prepared by different methods such as: thermal evaporation [6,7], low-energy cluster deposition technique (LECBD) [8], hybrid induction and laser heating (HILH) of glasses [9], dehydratation of antimony acid [10], chemical vapour deposition (CVD) [11], the calcining process in air of Sb2O3 [12], d.c. sputtering [13], vapor transport and condensation [14].
In this work, the thermal evaporation of antimony element is selected to prepare this compound. An annealing in air atmosphere has been used to reach Sb x O y oxides thin films. These films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). On the other hand, Sb2O4 oxide thin films prepared using optimal conditions and having suitable optical properties could be tested as a transparent oxide in many optoelectronic devices. To our knowledge, the formation of Sb2O4 thin film by a simple process has not been widely tested up to now.

Experiment:
2.1 Films preparation Sb x O y thin films were grown at ambient temperature by thermal evaporation of Sb element. The films were deposited on 1×2cm2 glass substrates. First, Sb (99.98% of purity) thin films were obtained by evaporation in the HV chamber using a relatively low pressure of the order of 10−4–10−5 Pa. Typical deposition parameters of this metal correspond to a growth rate of 1nms−1 and a film thickness of 250nm. Finally the as-obtained films were annealed in air atmosphere during 2h under various annealing temperatures Tr varying in the range 400–550°C using a programmed tubular oven.
2.2 Characterization techniques The X-ray diffraction analysis of the prepared layers were performed by a copper-source diffractometer (Analytical X Pert PROMPD), with the wavelength (λ=1.54056Å). The optical transmission and reflection measures have been achieved by means of a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV 3100S) dotted with an integrating sphere (LISR 3200). The spectrophotometer consists of double-beam monochromator with enough energy to make several types of accurate measures in a wide wavelength range (220–1800nm). The morphological investigation has been achieved by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using a VEECO digital instrument 3A apparatus, operating in contact mode.

Results And Discussion:
3.1 X-ray analysis Fig. 1 -a0 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of Sb evaporated thin film. One can notice the appearance of the orientations (003), and (006), which are characteristic of the antimony material in rhombohedral phase (PDF 85-1324). In the same figure (Fig. 1-a and b), it can be noted that the layer, prepared using an annealing temperature in 400–450°C domain is a mixture of Sb and Sb2O3 oxide. When the annealing temperature increases, the corresponding diffractograms (Fig. 1-c) show the apparition of Sb2O4 binary starting from Tr=470° C. Particularly, for Tr equal or upper than 500°C, the binary oxide Sb2O4 appears in more and more in favor of binary Sb2O3 phase. In fact, for this temperature, the layer, prepared by this heat treatment way, is oriented according to the privileged direction (004) of the orthorhombic α-variety (a=5.434Å, b=4.809Å, c=11.779Å) (PDF 78-2066), Fig. 1 (d and e) and Table 1 . Moreover, we point out the presence of (002) line characteristic of the same oxide. This depicts that the formation reaction of the material goes on slowly and requires a thermodynamic activation to form antimony tetroxide at a critical annealing temperature equal to 470°C according to the following reaction between oxygen and antimony trioxide: S b 2 O 3 + 1 2 O 2 T=470 ° C → S b 2 O 4 . Moreover, for annealed film at Tr=550°C for 2h, we remark an improvement of the preferential orientation along of the c-axis and the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) very small (less than 0.3°) showing a good amorphous state of the Sb2O4 thin film prepared at such annealing temperature. According to literature, Sb2O4 phase exists in two stable forms: the room temperature α-Sb2O4 is orthorhombic while the high temperature leads to monoclinic β-Sb2O4 phase. Also, for normal pressure, it is reported that the α to β transition occurs at 935°C [15–21]. The present work has for merit the fact of giving, for the first time, the possibility of synthesis of this oxide from a simple thermal evaporation method of Sb thin films followed by a heat treatment in air at 500–550°C.
3.2 AFM observations Fig. 2 shows the AFM micrographs of annealed Sb x O y thin films deposited on the glass substrates. It can be seen that AFM observation concerning annealed film at Tr=400°C (Fig. 2) depicts a smooth surface morphology. On the contrary, when Tr increases, the heat treatment depicts a disturbed surface with randomly oriented grains and hollow zones showing a rough surface of (Sb, Sb2O3). Finally, an enhancement of the orientation has obtained therefore for films prepared at Tr equal/or higher than 500°C showing that this annealing treatment process has an effective role (Table 2 ). Also, this treatment temperature leads to an improvement of roughness of the film in which the small grains coalesce to form grains having various micro-sizes, and this improvement of the surface state is more apparent on AFM surface observation of the film heated at 550°C (Fig. 2).
3.3 Optical study The optical transmission T(λ) and reflection R(λ) optical spectra at room temperature for Sb x O y thin films annealed in [400–550°C] domain are shown in Fig. 3 . As it is seen, the transmission coefficient increases when the annealing temperature increases showing that oxygen element is engaged and fits into these films. Also, for the sample annealed at 400°C, the transmission coefficient is equal to 40% and the R(λ) relatively high value showing that the film has no negligible Sb metallic phase whereas when Tr increases the T(λ) reaches 80% as value for pure Sb2O4 oxide prepared at 550°C. The refractive index n(λ) and the extinction k(λ) were calculated using a numerical method described elsewhere [22]. The calculated data of these coefficients are plotted in Fig. 4 . The refractive index value varies in the range from 2.8 to 1.8 whereas the extinction coefficient varies in the domain [10−3; 510−4] for visible and near infrared regions. We note a similar behavior of these optical constants to those reported on Sb2O4 thin film reported previously on antimony oxide prepared by d.c. sputtering method [13]. In the same way, the absorption coefficient α of this material was calculated from the mean absorption edge from the values of k obtained according to the following formula: α=4 π k λ . The values of α related to Sb2O4 oxide prepared respectively at 500 and 550°C were used to plot a graph of (αhν)2 against incident photon energy which shows a linear variation indicating direct transitions (Fig. 5 ). The extrapolation of the straight line intersects the hν axis at 3.9eV corresponding to the value of the band gap energy of this material. This value of the gap energy of Sb2O4 of n-type thin film oxide shows that this oxide could be used therefore with an appropriate dopage as possible transparent conductor layer in optoelectronic devices. This value is slightly different to Sb2O3 oxide (3.6eV) [23,24] which is considered to possibly be due to the difference in the oxygen index. On the other hand, using the n and k calculated values, the dielectric constant is deduced according to: (1) ε=n − i k 2=ε 1 + i ε 2 where: (2) { ε 1=n 2 − k 2 ε 2=2 n k are respectively the real and imaginary parts of ε. In the infrared region where ωτ ≪1 and n 2 ≫ k 2, ε 1 can be expressed in terms of the wavelength λ as [25]: (3) ε 1=ε ∞ − ε ∞ ω p 2 4 π 2 c 2 λ 2 where τ represents the relaxation time and ε ∞ is the limiting value of the high frequency dielectric constant. In the same line, the plasma frequency ω p is given by [26]: (4) ω p 2=4 π 2 N e 2 ε ∞ m e * with: N is the charge carriers density and m e ⁎ is the effective mass of the charge carrier. Eq. (3) suggests that the value of ε ∞ and ω p could be determined from the intercept and the slope of the linear portion of ε 1 versus λ 2 plot which is shown in (Fig. 6 ). Thus if ω p is known, the ratio N m e * could in principle be determined (Table 3 ). To calculate the dielectric susceptibility χ e, we use the expression reported by Spitzer and Fan [26]: (5) { χ e=− N e 2 m e * ω 2 ε ∞ − ε 1=− 4 π χ e . Fig. 6 shows −χ e versus λ in spectral range 600–1400nm. The figure depicts that −χ e becomes sufficiently large to reduce the dielectric constant and the refractive index in the near infrared region. Finally, some of optical constants regarding Sb2O4 thin film oxide deduced by the present work are gathered in Table 3. Unfortunately, there are a few optical results on Sb2O4 thin films in the literature. Nevertheless, the result is concerning the n and k values are close to those reported by de Sande et al. [13] found regarding the same oxide synthesised by d.c. sputtering technique.
3.4 Opto-thermal study 3.4.1 Determination of the effective absorptivity α̂ using the BPES The effective absorptivity α̂ has been defined in precedent studies [27,28] as the mean normalized absorbance weighted by I λ ˜ A M 1.5 , the solar standard irradiance: (6) α ˆ=∫ 0 1 I λ ˜ A M 1.5 × α λ ˜ d λ ˜ ∫ 0 1 I λ ˜ A M 1.5 d λ ˜ where I λ ˜ A M 1.5 is the Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance, fitted using the Boubaker Polynomials Expansion Scheme BPES [29–43]: I λ ˜=1 2 N 0 ∑ n=1 N 0 θ n ⋅ B 4 n λ ˜ × β n , where β n are the Boubaker polynomials [33–43], B 4n are the minimal positive roots, θ n are given coefficients, N 0 is a given integer, α λ ˜ is the normalized absorbance spectrum and λ ˜ is the normalized wavelength: (7) { λ ∈ λ min , λ max ⇔ λ ˜ ∈ 0 , 1 λ min=300.0 nm ; λ max=1800.0 nm . The normalized absorbance spectrum α λ ˜ is deduced from the BPES by establishing a set of m experimental measured values of the transmittance–reflectance vector T i λ ˜ i ; R i λ ˜ i | i=1 … m versus the normalized wavelength λ ˜ i | i=1 … m is established. Then the system (8) is set: (8) { R λ ˜=1 2 N 0 ∑ n=1 N 0 ξ n × B 4 n λ ˜ × β n T λ ˜=1 2 N 0 ∑ n=1 N 0 ξ ′ n × B 4 n λ ˜ × β n . Where β n are the 4n-Boubaker polynomials B 4n minimal positive roots [34,37], N 0 is a given integer and ξ n and ξ n ′ are coefficients determined through the Boubaker Polynomials Expansion Scheme BPES. The normalized absorbance spectrum α λ ˜ is deuced from the relation: (9) α λ ˜=ln 1 − R λ ˜ T λ ˜ + ln 1 − R λ ˜ 2 T λ ˜ 2 d where d is the layer thickness. The obtained value of normalized absorbance spectrum α λ ˜ is a final guide to the determination of the effective absorptivity α ˆ via (Eq. (6)). 3.4.2 Determination of Amlouk–Boubaker opto-thermal expansivity ψ AB The Amlouk–Boubaker opto-thermal expansivity ψ AB is a thermo-physical parameter defined in precedent studies [27,28], as a 3D expansion velocity of the transmitted heat inside the material. It is expressed in m3s−1, and calculated by: (10) ψ A B=D α ˆ where D is the thermal diffusivity and α ˆ is the effective absorptivity (Section 3.4.1). The values of the calculated values of the Amlouk–Boubaker opto-thermal expansivity ψ AB, for the differently annealed layers are gathered in Table 4 .
3.5 Micro-Hardness Vickers (Hv) measurement The Micro-Hardness Vickers (Hv) set of measurements has been performed in the MA2I Laboratory (ENIT, Tunisia). The tests consist of hitting the targeted face of each sample by a common diamond-pyramidal-indenter under a prefixed load (Fig. 7 a). The obtained imprint dimensions were subjected to geometrical standardized analyzes yielding a scaled value: the Micro-Hardness Vickers (Hv). The obtained values are gathered in Fig. 7b. The illustrated variation of Hv microhardness with the annealing temperature Tr traduces the fact that for increasing temperature the mean microhardness increases in the range 700–850 Hv. These variations can be explained by the presence of the orientation preference induced by annealing as discussed in precedent sections. Since the tests were based on resistance to direct penetration, the presence of c-axis oriented lattices (parallel to Vickers diamond-pyramidal-indenter direction) is favorable to increasing hardness.

Moreover, for annealed film at Tr=550°C for 2h, we remark an improvement of the preferential orientation along of the c-axis and the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) very small (less than 0.3°) showing a good amorphous state of the Sb2O4 thin film prepared at such annealing temperature.

The optical transmission T(λ) and reflection R(λ) optical spectra at room temperature for Sb x O y thin films annealed in [400–550°C] domain are shown in Fig. 3 . As it is seen, the transmission coefficient increases when the annealing temperature increases showing that oxygen element is engaged and fits into these films. Also, for the sample annealed at 400°C, the transmission coefficient is equal to 40% and the R(λ) relatively high value showing that the film has no negligible Sb metallic phase whereas when Tr increases the T(λ) reaches 80% as value for pure Sb2O4 oxide prepared at 550°C.

This value is slightly different to Sb2O3 oxide (3.6eV) [23,24] which is considered to possibly be due to the difference in the oxygen index.
On the other hand, using the n and k calculated values, the dielectric constant is deduced according to: (1) ε=n − i k 2=ε 1 + i ε 2 where: (2) { ε 1=n 2 − k 2 ε 2=2 n k are respectively the real and imaginary parts of ε.
In the infrared region where ωτ ≪1 and n 2 ≫ k 2, ε 1 can be expressed in terms of the wavelength λ as [25]: (3) ε 1=ε ∞ − ε ∞ ω p 2 4 π 2 c 2 λ 2 where τ represents the relaxation time and ε ∞ is the limiting value of the high frequency dielectric constant.

Opto-thermal Study:
3.4.1 Determination of the effective absorptivity α̂ using the BPES The effective absorptivity α̂ has been defined in precedent studies [27,28] as the mean normalized absorbance weighted by I λ ˜ A M 1.5 , the solar standard irradiance: (6) α ˆ=∫ 0 1 I λ ˜ A M 1.5 × α λ ˜ d λ ˜ ∫ 0 1 I λ ˜ A M 1.5 d λ ˜ where I λ ˜ A M 1.5 is the Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance, fitted using the Boubaker Polynomials Expansion Scheme BPES [29–43]: I λ ˜=1 2 N 0 ∑ n=1 N 0 θ n ⋅ B 4 n λ ˜ × β n , where β n are the Boubaker polynomials [33–43], B 4n are the minimal positive roots, θ n are given coefficients, N 0 is a given integer, α λ ˜ is the normalized absorbance spectrum and λ ˜ is the normalized wavelength: (7) { λ ∈ λ min , λ max ⇔ λ ˜ ∈ 0 , 1 λ min=300.0 nm ; λ max=1800.0 nm .

The values of the calculated values of the Amlouk–Boubaker opto-thermal expansivity ψ AB, for the differently annealed layers are gathered in Table 4 .

Determination Of The Effective Absorptivity Α̂ Using The Bpes:
The effective absorptivity α̂ has been defined in precedent studies [27,28] as the mean normalized absorbance weighted by I λ ˜ A M 1.5 , the solar standard irradiance: (6) α ˆ=∫ 0 1 I λ ˜ A M 1.5 × α λ ˜ d λ ˜ ∫ 0 1 I λ ˜ A M 1.5 d λ ˜ where I λ ˜ A M 1.5 is the Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance, fitted using the Boubaker Polynomials Expansion Scheme BPES [29–43]: I λ ˜=1 2 N 0 ∑ n=1 N 0 θ n ⋅ B 4 n λ ˜ × β n , where β n are the Boubaker polynomials [33–43], B 4n are the minimal positive roots, θ n are given coefficients, N 0 is a given integer, α λ ˜ is the normalized absorbance spectrum and λ ˜ is the normalized wavelength: (7) { λ ∈ λ min , λ max ⇔ λ ˜ ∈ 0 , 1 λ min=300.0 nm ; λ max=1800.0 nm .
The normalized absorbance spectrum α λ ˜ is deduced from the BPES by establishing a set of m experimental measured values of the transmittance–reflectance vector T i λ ˜ i ; R i λ ˜ i | i=1 … m versus the normalized wavelength λ ˜ i | i=1 … m is established.

Micro-hardness Vickers (hv) Measurement:
The Micro-Hardness Vickers (Hv) set of measurements has been performed in the MA2I Laboratory (ENIT, Tunisia). The tests consist of hitting the targeted face of each sample by a common diamond-pyramidal-indenter under a prefixed load (Fig. 7 a). The obtained imprint dimensions were subjected to geometrical standardized analyzes yielding a scaled value: the Micro-Hardness Vickers (Hv). The obtained values are gathered in Fig. 7b. The illustrated variation of Hv microhardness with the annealing temperature Tr traduces the fact that for increasing temperature the mean microhardness increases in the range 700–850 Hv. These variations can be explained by the presence of the orientation preference induced by annealing as discussed in precedent sections. Since the tests were based on resistance to direct penetration, the presence of c-axis oriented lattices (parallel to Vickers diamond-pyramidal-indenter direction) is favorable to increasing hardness.

Discussion And Conclusion:
S b x O y | x=2 y=3 ; 4 thin films were deposited onto glass substrates by thermal evaporation. The influence of the thermal treatment (annealing) under air atmosphere in 400–550°C of evaporated antimony thin films has been carried out. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the obtained films were formed from the mixture of oxides such as Sb2O3 and Sb2O4 for annealing temperature under 470°C. Beyond 500°C, only Sb2O4 thin film material was obtained. The optical transmittance of the annealed samples in the near infrared region was of the order of 80% and the band gap energy estimated has a value around 3.9eV. The refractive index, the dielectric constant as well as the plasma frequency of this oxide were also calculated.
Moreover, the optical, mechanical and opto-thermal investigation results were in good agreement with those of XRD and AFM techniques and with some recently published results [44–46]. The relatively high c-axis oriented direction of grains of the highly annealed films has indeed a benefit effect on their opto-thermal properties via an obvious decrease of ψ AB values (≈−30%).

Conclusion:
Sb x O y oxides thin films have been prepared using a low-cost protocol in air atmosphere. Appropriate analyses show that the films annealed at Tr=550°C are well constituted of the Sb2O4 orthorhombic phase with elements oriented preferentially towards (004) direction. In the same context, Hv microhardness measurements confirm XRD patterns and AFM analyses. The set of studies show that S b x O y | x=2 y=3 ; 4 thin films sprayed samples are suitable to be used as powerful windows, and transparent conductor in many light-to-heat converters.
It can be stated that, for the first time, the possibility of synthesis of the binary compound Sb x O y is offered by a heat treatment in air at 500–550°C following a simple thermal evaporation cheap and reproducible protocol applied to Sb thin films.

Body:
Antimony oxides Sb x O y are important oxides which have been investigated for their numerous applications. Among them Sb2O3 and Sb2O4 which have a high-efficiency flame-retardant synergist power in plastics, paints and could be used with other oxides as a catalyst for hydrocarbon cracking and hydrogen reduction, and in the production of ceramic enamels [1,2]. Also, they are used as wonderful ultraviolet filters for interferometric applications and present extended infrared transmission [3–5].

Moreover, their band gap energy larger than 3eV makes them suitable as attractive materials in optoelectronic application. Materials of Sb oxides have been prepared by different methods such as: thermal evaporation [6,7], low-energy cluster deposition technique (LECBD) [8], hybrid induction and laser heating (HILH) of glasses [9], dehydratation of antimony acid [10], chemical vapour deposition (CVD) [11], the calcining process in air of Sb2O3 [12], d.c. sputtering [13], vapor transport and condensation [14].

In this work, the thermal evaporation of antimony element is selected to prepare this compound. An annealing in air atmosphere has been used to reach Sb x O y oxides thin films. These films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). On the other hand, Sb2O4 oxide thin films prepared using optimal conditions and having suitable optical properties could be tested as a transparent oxide in many optoelectronic devices. To our knowledge, the formation of Sb2O4 thin film by a simple process has not been widely tested up to now.

Sb x O y thin films were grown at ambient temperature by thermal evaporation of Sb element. The films were deposited on 1×2cm2 glass substrates. First, Sb (99.98% of purity) thin films were obtained by evaporation in the HV chamber using a relatively low pressure of the order of 10−4–10−5 Pa. Typical deposition parameters of this metal correspond to a growth rate of 1nms−1 and a film thickness of 250nm. Finally the as-obtained films were annealed in air atmosphere during 2h under various annealing temperatures Tr varying in the range 400–550°C using a programmed tubular oven.

The X-ray diffraction analysis of the prepared layers were performed by a copper-source diffractometer (Analytical X Pert PROMPD), with the wavelength (λ=1.54056Å). The optical transmission and reflection measures have been achieved by means of a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV 3100S) dotted with an integrating sphere (LISR 3200). The spectrophotometer consists of double-beam monochromator with enough energy to make several types of accurate measures in a wide wavelength range (220–1800nm). The morphological investigation has been achieved by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using a VEECO digital instrument 3A apparatus, operating in contact mode.

Fig. 1 -a0 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of Sb evaporated thin film. One can notice the appearance of the orientations (003), and (006), which are characteristic of the antimony material in rhombohedral phase (PDF 85-1324). In the same figure (Fig. 1-a and b), it can be noted that the layer, prepared using an annealing temperature in 400–450°C domain is a mixture of Sb and Sb2O3 oxide. When the annealing temperature increases, the corresponding diffractograms (Fig. 1-c) show the apparition of Sb2O4 binary starting from Tr=470° C. Particularly, for Tr equal or upper than 500°C, the binary oxide Sb2O4 appears in more and more in favor of binary Sb2O3 phase. In fact, for this temperature, the layer, prepared by this heat treatment way, is oriented according to the privileged direction (004) of the orthorhombic α-variety (a=5.434Å, b=4.809Å, c=11.779Å) (PDF 78-2066), Fig. 1 (d and e) and Table 1 . Moreover, we point out the presence of (002) line characteristic of the same oxide. This depicts that the formation reaction of the material goes on slowly and requires a thermodynamic activation to form antimony tetroxide at a critical annealing temperature equal to 470°C according to the following reaction between oxygen and antimony trioxide: S b 2 O 3 + 1 2 O 2 T=470 ° C → S b 2 O 4 .

Moreover, for annealed film at Tr=550°C for 2h, we remark an improvement of the preferential orientation along of the c-axis and the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) very small (less than 0.3°) showing a good amorphous state of the Sb2O4 thin film prepared at such annealing temperature.

According to literature, Sb2O4 phase exists in two stable forms: the room temperature α-Sb2O4 is orthorhombic while the high temperature leads to monoclinic β-Sb2O4 phase. Also, for normal pressure, it is reported that the α to β transition occurs at 935°C [15–21].

The present work has for merit the fact of giving, for the first time, the possibility of synthesis of this oxide from a simple thermal evaporation method of Sb thin films followed by a heat treatment in air at 500–550°C.

Fig. 2 shows the AFM micrographs of annealed Sb x O y thin films deposited on the glass substrates. It can be seen that AFM observation concerning annealed film at Tr=400°C (Fig. 2) depicts a smooth surface morphology. On the contrary, when Tr increases, the heat treatment depicts a disturbed surface with randomly oriented grains and hollow zones showing a rough surface of (Sb, Sb2O3). Finally, an enhancement of the orientation has obtained therefore for films prepared at Tr equal/or higher than 500°C showing that this annealing treatment process has an effective role (Table 2 ). Also, this treatment temperature leads to an improvement of roughness of the film in which the small grains coalesce to form grains having various micro-sizes, and this improvement of the surface state is more apparent on AFM surface observation of the film heated at 550°C (Fig. 2).

The optical transmission T(λ) and reflection R(λ) optical spectra at room temperature for Sb x O y thin films annealed in [400–550°C] domain are shown in Fig. 3 . As it is seen, the transmission coefficient increases when the annealing temperature increases showing that oxygen element is engaged and fits into these films. Also, for the sample annealed at 400°C, the transmission coefficient is equal to 40% and the R(λ) relatively high value showing that the film has no negligible Sb metallic phase whereas when Tr increases the T(λ) reaches 80% as value for pure Sb2O4 oxide prepared at 550°C.

The refractive index n(λ) and the extinction k(λ) were calculated using a numerical method described elsewhere [22]. The calculated data of these coefficients are plotted in Fig. 4 . The refractive index value varies in the range from 2.8 to 1.8 whereas the extinction coefficient varies in the domain [10−3; 510−4] for visible and near infrared regions. We note a similar behavior of these optical constants to those reported on Sb2O4 thin film reported previously on antimony oxide prepared by d.c. sputtering method [13].

In the same way, the absorption coefficient α of this material was calculated from the mean absorption edge from the values of k obtained according to the following formula: α=4 π k λ . The values of α related to Sb2O4 oxide prepared respectively at 500 and 550°C were used to plot a graph of (αhν)2 against incident photon energy which shows a linear variation indicating direct transitions (Fig. 5 ). The extrapolation of the straight line intersects the hν axis at 3.9eV corresponding to the value of the band gap energy of this material.

This value of the gap energy of Sb2O4 of n-type thin film oxide shows that this oxide could be used therefore with an appropriate dopage as possible transparent conductor layer in optoelectronic devices.

This value is slightly different to Sb2O3 oxide (3.6eV) [23,24] which is considered to possibly be due to the difference in the oxygen index.

On the other hand, using the n and k calculated values, the dielectric constant is deduced according to: (1) ε=n − i k 2=ε 1 + i ε 2 where: (2) { ε 1=n 2 − k 2 ε 2=2 n k are respectively the real and imaginary parts of ε.

In the infrared region where ωτ ≪1 and n 2 ≫ k 2, ε 1 can be expressed in terms of the wavelength λ as [25]: (3) ε 1=ε ∞ − ε ∞ ω p 2 4 π 2 c 2 λ 2 where τ represents the relaxation time and ε ∞ is the limiting value of the high frequency dielectric constant.

In the same line, the plasma frequency ω p is given by [26]: (4) ω p 2=4 π 2 N e 2 ε ∞ m e * with: N is the charge carriers density and m e ⁎ is the effective mass of the charge carrier.

Eq. (3) suggests that the value of ε ∞ and ω p could be determined from the intercept and the slope of the linear portion of ε 1 versus λ 2 plot which is shown in (Fig. 6 ).

Thus if ω p is known, the ratio N m e * could in principle be determined (Table 3 ).

To calculate the dielectric susceptibility χ e, we use the expression reported by Spitzer and Fan [26]: (5) { χ e=− N e 2 m e * ω 2 ε ∞ − ε 1=− 4 π χ e .

Fig. 6 shows −χ e versus λ in spectral range 600–1400nm. The figure depicts that −χ e becomes sufficiently large to reduce the dielectric constant and the refractive index in the near infrared region.

Finally, some of optical constants regarding Sb2O4 thin film oxide deduced by the present work are gathered in Table 3. Unfortunately, there are a few optical results on Sb2O4 thin films in the literature. Nevertheless, the result is concerning the n and k values are close to those reported by de Sande et al. [13] found regarding the same oxide synthesised by d.c. sputtering technique.

The effective absorptivity α̂ has been defined in precedent studies [27,28] as the mean normalized absorbance weighted by I λ ˜ A M 1.5 , the solar standard irradiance: (6) α ˆ=∫ 0 1 I λ ˜ A M 1.5 × α λ ˜ d λ ˜ ∫ 0 1 I λ ˜ A M 1.5 d λ ˜ where I λ ˜ A M 1.5 is the Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance, fitted using the Boubaker Polynomials Expansion Scheme BPES [29–43]: I λ ˜=1 2 N 0 ∑ n=1 N 0 θ n ⋅ B 4 n λ ˜ × β n , where β n are the Boubaker polynomials [33–43], B 4n are the minimal positive roots, θ n are given coefficients, N 0 is a given integer, α λ ˜ is the normalized absorbance spectrum and λ ˜ is the normalized wavelength: (7) { λ ∈ λ min , λ max ⇔ λ ˜ ∈ 0 , 1 λ min=300.0 nm ; λ max=1800.0 nm .

The normalized absorbance spectrum α λ ˜ is deduced from the BPES by establishing a set of m experimental measured values of the transmittance–reflectance vector T i λ ˜ i ; R i λ ˜ i | i=1 … m versus the normalized wavelength λ ˜ i | i=1 … m is established. Then the system (8) is set: (8) { R λ ˜=1 2 N 0 ∑ n=1 N 0 ξ n × B 4 n λ ˜ × β n T λ ˜=1 2 N 0 ∑ n=1 N 0 ξ ′ n × B 4 n λ ˜ × β n .

Where β n are the 4n-Boubaker polynomials B 4n minimal positive roots [34,37], N 0 is a given integer and ξ n and ξ n ′ are coefficients determined through the Boubaker Polynomials Expansion Scheme BPES.

The normalized absorbance spectrum α λ ˜ is deuced from the relation: (9) α λ ˜=ln 1 − R λ ˜ T λ ˜ + ln 1 − R λ ˜ 2 T λ ˜ 2 d where d is the layer thickness.

The obtained value of normalized absorbance spectrum α λ ˜ is a final guide to the determination of the effective absorptivity α ˆ via (Eq. (6)).

The Amlouk–Boubaker opto-thermal expansivity ψ AB is a thermo-physical parameter defined in precedent studies [27,28], as a 3D expansion velocity of the transmitted heat inside the material. It is expressed in m3s−1, and calculated by: (10) ψ A B=D α ˆ where D is the thermal diffusivity and α ˆ is the effective absorptivity (Section 3.4.1).

The values of the calculated values of the Amlouk–Boubaker opto-thermal expansivity ψ AB, for the differently annealed layers are gathered in Table 4 .

The Micro-Hardness Vickers (Hv) set of measurements has been performed in the MA2I Laboratory (ENIT, Tunisia). The tests consist of hitting the targeted face of each sample by a common diamond-pyramidal-indenter under a prefixed load (Fig. 7 a). The obtained imprint dimensions were subjected to geometrical standardized analyzes yielding a scaled value: the Micro-Hardness Vickers (Hv). The obtained values are gathered in Fig. 7b. The illustrated variation of Hv microhardness with the annealing temperature Tr traduces the fact that for increasing temperature the mean microhardness increases in the range 700–850 Hv. These variations can be explained by the presence of the orientation preference induced by annealing as discussed in precedent sections. Since the tests were based on resistance to direct penetration, the presence of c-axis oriented lattices (parallel to Vickers diamond-pyramidal-indenter direction) is favorable to increasing hardness.

S b x O y | x=2 y=3 ; 4 thin films were deposited onto glass substrates by thermal evaporation. The influence of the thermal treatment (annealing) under air atmosphere in 400–550°C of evaporated antimony thin films has been carried out. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the obtained films were formed from the mixture of oxides such as Sb2O3 and Sb2O4 for annealing temperature under 470°C. Beyond 500°C, only Sb2O4 thin film material was obtained. The optical transmittance of the annealed samples in the near infrared region was of the order of 80% and the band gap energy estimated has a value around 3.9eV. The refractive index, the dielectric constant as well as the plasma frequency of this oxide were also calculated.

Moreover, the optical, mechanical and opto-thermal investigation results were in good agreement with those of XRD and AFM techniques and with some recently published results [44–46]. The relatively high c-axis oriented direction of grains of the highly annealed films has indeed a benefit effect on their opto-thermal properties via an obvious decrease of ψ AB values (≈−30%).

Sb x O y oxides thin films have been prepared using a low-cost protocol in air atmosphere. Appropriate analyses show that the films annealed at Tr=550°C are well constituted of the Sb2O4 orthorhombic phase with elements oriented preferentially towards (004) direction. In the same context, Hv microhardness measurements confirm XRD patterns and AFM analyses. The set of studies show that S b x O y | x=2 y=3 ; 4 thin films sprayed samples are suitable to be used as powerful windows, and transparent conductor in many light-to-heat converters.

It can be stated that, for the first time, the possibility of synthesis of the binary compound Sb x O y is offered by a heat treatment in air at 500–550°C following a simple thermal evaporation cheap and reproducible protocol applied to Sb thin films.

Title:
Improvement of mechanical and dielectric properties of PIP-SiC

Abstract:
In order to optimize the mechanical and dielectric properties of SiCf/SiC composites, Ti3SiC2 was introduced into the composites by a modified precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) process. The results reveal that the appropriate Ti3SiC2 content in the infiltration precursor can effectively enhance the infiltration efficiency and decrease the open porosity of SiCf/SiC composites. The maximum flexural strength of the composites reaches 273MPa when the Ti3SiC2 content is 9wt%, which is 131% higher than that of the composites without filler (118MPa). This is mainly attributed to the high density and suitable interfacial bonding of the composites with the Ti3SiC2 filler. Both the ε′ and ε″ values of SiCf/SiC composites show a monotonically increasing tendency from 13.5–16.5 and i15–i19 to 27.5–32.5 and i31.5–i39 with the Ti3SiC2 content increase from 0 to 15wt%. Especially, the conductivity and complex permittivity of the composites display a relative large increasing extent for Ti3SiC2 content exceeding 9wt% owing to the percolation threshold effect.

Introduction:
The increasing applications of continuous SiC fiber-reinforced SiC matrix composites (SiCf/SiC composites) make it extremely important to develop advanced composites with superior characteristics such as excellent mechanical property, good thermostability, low density, and special electrical and dielectric properties [1–3]. Regarding the typical fabrication methods of SiCf/SiC composites, precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) process is of great importance, which has been widely employed because of its easy adaptability for large-scale components with complex shapes, controllable microstructure and low cost of fabrication [4,5]. Polycarbosilane (PCS) is a kind of common precursor of SiC matrix for the PIP process, and multiple infiltration-curing-pyrolysis cycles are required to densify the composites. However, the gas evolution and volume shrinkage of simplex PCS precursor during the pyrolysis process can result in a low densification efficiency and high porosity of the SiC matrix, which will lead to the generation of microcracks and degradation of mechanical properties for SiCf/SiC composites [6,7]. Effective consolidation to eliminate pores and cracks is a very important technical issue for making high-performance composites. Many efforts have been done to improve the density of the composites during the PIP process, including developing new precursors with high ceramic yield [8,9], incorporating active and inert fillers to decrease the volume shrinkage [10,11] and combining the PIP process with other methods [12,13]. Particularly, it is an effective and controllable way to make strong and homogeneous matrices with low porosity for SiCf/SiC composites by introducing inert filler into the PCS precursor [14–17]. Titanium silicon carbide (Ti3SiC2) is a spotlighted material for many engineering applications owing to its nano-laminate structure, good electrical and thermal conductivities, low specific gravity (~4.5g/cm3), and excellent oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures [18,19]. Several papers have reported the efforts to introduce Ti3SiC2 into the fiber-reinforced composites in recent years. Fan et al. [20] fabricated the C/SiC–Ti3SiC2 composites by joint processes of slurry infiltration and liquid silicon infiltration (LSI) using TiC–C slurry. Spencer et al. [21] prepared the SiC fiber-reinforced Ti3SiC2 matrix composites by the hot isostatic pressing (HIP) method. Yang et al. [22] fabricated the Cf/Ti3SiC2–SiC composites by the PIP process using Ti3SiC2 as the inert filler, and the Ti3SiC2 was introduced by in-situ reaction between Ti and polycarbosilane mixtures. However, up to now, little consideration was given on the fabrication of SiCf/SiC composites by the PIP method using Ti3SiC2 powders as inert filler.
In the present work, Ti3SiC2 was introduced into the PCS precursor as inert filler to optimize the mechanical and dielectric properties of 2.5D SiCf/SiC composites. The microstructural evolutions of the matrix and composites varying with the Ti3SiC2 content were characterized. The density, mechanical property and complex permittivity of the composites were investigated.

Experimental Procedure:
2.1 Raw materials The 2.5D KD-I SiC fabrics with a volume fraction of 40%, provided by National University of Defense Technology, China, were used as the reinforcement. General characteristics of the KD-I SiC fibers were shown in Ref. [23]. PCS powders with an average molecular weight of 1800, provided by National University of Defense Technology, were used as the polymer precursor of SiC matrix, and xylene was used as the solvent of PCS. Ti3SiC2 powders were supplied by Jinghe Chemical Reagent Factory, Hebei, China, and the purity is greater than 98%. The density and electrical conductivity of Ti3SiC2 powders were 4.5g/cm3 and 4.0×106 S/m respectively.
2.2 Preparation of SiCf/SiC composites with Ti3SiC2 filler Prior to the composites preparation, PCS and Ti3SiC2 powders were firstly mixed together following the mass ratios shown in Table 1, and then ball-milled for 12h. The mixture was dispersed in xylene respectively and ultrasonically stirred for 30min in order to mix sufficiently. Thus, the homogeneous slurries with different mass fractions of Ti3SiC2 were obtained. Subsequently, the multiple fabrics were separately put into an airtight vessel and infiltrated with various slurries in vacuum. Then the samples were diverted into an autoclave and 6MPa nitrogen atmosphere was filled in, and this condition was maintained for 20min. After infiltration, the samples were dried and thermally cross-linked at 180°C for 2h in air. Eventually, these samples were heated at 1100°C and held for 2h in a vacuum sintering furnace (ZRS-150, Sante, Jinzhou, China). Each sample was subjected to several PIP cycles until the mass gains of the final composites were less than 1wt% and these fabricated composites were designated as Composite A, B, C, D, E and F, respectively.
2.3 Materials characterization The structures of the components of SiCf/SiC composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (X׳Pert PRO MPD, PANalytical, Almelo, The Netherlands) and Raman spectroscopy (LabRAM HR800). The fracture surface morphologies of the composites and matrix after three-point bending tests were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Model SUPRA-55, Zeiss, Germany), equipped with energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS). The densities and open porosities of the fabricated composites were measured by the Archimedes method. The weight of the samples increases after each PIP cycle was measured by an electronic balance. The flexural strength was characterized by three-point bending tests (specimen size of 40 l mm×4 w mm×3 t mm) with a cross-head speed of 0.5mm/min and support span length of 30mm using a universal testing machine (Haida Qualitative Analysis, HD-609B), following the general guidelines of ASTM standard C 1341. Five specimens were evaluated to eliminate the testing deviations. The DC electrical conductivity (σ dc) of the composites was measured by the two-probe direct current method [24], and the testing terminals of the composites were brushed with silver painting to avoid the contact resistance. The σ dc can be calculated by the following equation: (1) σ dc=L / R S where R is the resistance paralleled to the wrap direction of the composites, S is the cross-sectional area of the composites, and L is the length of the composites. The dielectric properties of SiCf/SiC composites were characterized by the real part (ε′) and imaginary part (ε″) of complex permittivity. Because of the low complex permittivity and melting point of paraffin, the samples of various powders for dielectric property measurements were prepared by mixing the produced powders with paraffin in a mass ratio of 3:1. For the measurement of SiC fabrics, melted paraffin wax was cast into the fabrics to obtain fabrics/paraffin wax composites so that the fiber bundles were fixed to facilitate the measurement of permittivity. The dimensions of the measured SiCf/SiC composites, SiC fabrics and powders/paraffin composites were 22.86 l mm×10.16 w mm×3.0 t mm. The complex permittivity was measured in the frequency range of 8.2–12.4GHz by the waveguide method using a vector network analyzer (E8362B). In addition, the surfaces of the prepared composites were polished before the measurement of complex permittivity in order to remove the agglomerative Ti3SiC2 filler during the PIP process.

The 2.5D KD-I SiC fabrics with a volume fraction of 40%, provided by National University of Defense Technology, China, were used as the reinforcement. General characteristics of the KD-I SiC fibers were shown in Ref. [23].

Ti3SiC2 powders were supplied by Jinghe Chemical Reagent Factory, Hebei, China, and the purity is greater than 98%. The density and electrical conductivity of Ti3SiC2 powders were 4.5g/cm3 and 4.0×106 S/m respectively.

Preparation Of Sicf/sic Composites With Ti3sic2 Filler:
Prior to the composites preparation, PCS and Ti3SiC2 powders were firstly mixed together following the mass ratios shown in Table 1, and then ball-milled for 12h. The mixture was dispersed in xylene respectively and ultrasonically stirred for 30min in order to mix sufficiently. Thus, the homogeneous slurries with different mass fractions of Ti3SiC2 were obtained.

In addition, the surfaces of the prepared composites were polished before the measurement of complex permittivity in order to remove the agglomerative Ti3SiC2 filler during the PIP process.

Results And Discussion:
3.1 Mechanical properties of SiCf/SiC composites with Ti3SiC2 filler Fig. 1 shows the SEM morphology and EDS analysis of the Ti3SiC2 filler. The Ti3SiC2 particles are mostly irregular laminar and granular flakes with the diameters of 0.5–2μm, and the large bodies are aggregated by those sub-micron particles. Thus, the Ti3SiC2 and PCS powders were ball-milled to reduce the aggregations and mix sufficiently. The EDS analysis shows that the Ti3SiC2 consists of 48.96% Ti, 16.32% Si and 34.72% C in atomic molar percentage respectively, and the elemental stoichiometric ratio is close to the nominal Ti3SiC2, further illustrating the purity of Ti3SiC2 phase. In order to illustrate the effects of Ti3SiC2 content on the densification behavior of SiCf/SiC composites, the weight of these samples increases after each PIP process was monitored and is shown in Fig. 2. It is observed that the PIP cycles of these composites decrease from 14 to 8 as the Ti3SiC2 content vary from 0 to 15wt%, which indicates that the incorporation of Ti3SiC2 significantly improves the infiltration efficiency. The weight increases after the first PIP cycle show distinctive differences and rise with the increasing Ti3SiC2 content. Owing to the increasing Ti3SiC2 content, more pyrolyzed products adhere to the Ti3SiC2 particles and thicker matrix layers are formed in the inter-bundle and intra-bundle areas, thus the infiltration and pyrolysis processes are enhanced. Fig. 3 shows the typical stress–displacement curves of SiCf/SiC composites with various Ti3SiC2 content. As displayed in Fig. 3, the flexural strengths of the composites increase firstly and then degrade as the Ti3SiC2 content increase from 0 to 15wt%. The results reveal that the Composite A shows a low flexural strength and brittle fracture behavior, while the composites with Ti3SiC2 filler exhibit enhanced flexural strength and failure displacement. Table 2 lists the properties of the fabricated SiCf/SiC composites. It exhibits that the maximum flexural strength reaches 273MPa when the Ti3SiC2 content is 9wt%, while the Composite A is only 118MPa. The typical fracture surface morphologies of various SiCf/SiC composites and matrices are illustrated and shown in Figs. 4 and 5. As seen from Fig. 4, when the Ti3SiC2 content are below 12wt%, the fracture surfaces of the composites are relatively plain, while the composites with 15wt% Ti3SiC2 filler exhibit long fibers pull-out. Especially, the fracture surface of the composites without filler shows obvious large pores owing to the volume shrinkage during the pyrolysis process. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5a, the matrix without filler is divided into plenty of discontinuous fragments and many continuous cracks generate. Thus, theses composites show a low flexural strength and catastrophic failure. For the composites with Ti3SiC2 particles, these inert filler can act as carriers for the growth of SiC matrix, and therefore effectively fill in the large pores and suppress the volume shrinkage effect, especially in the inter-bundle areas. Eventually, these SiCf/SiC composites with Ti3SiC2 filler show an obvious densification behavior, except for some discrete cracks in the matrix shown in Fig. 4. When the filler content is 9wt%, as shown in Fig. 5b and e, a dense and continuous matrix is formed with the filler dispersing uniformly in the SiC substrate, which helps to enhance the resistance of the matrix to external force. In addition, the inner spaces in the intra-bundle areas are mostly filled with the SiC matrix and Ti3SiC2 particles. As a result, the high density and suitable interfacial bonding lead to a high flexural strength [25,26]. As the filler content increase, the Ti3SiC2 particles will aggregate and adhere together by the limited precursor, and considerable micro-pores are left in the matrix after the pyrolysis process. These closed pores cannot be further filled in the following infiltration process, and a loose matrix is formed eventually, as shown in Fig. 5c. On the other hand, most filler are filtered out by the fiber filaments during the infiltration process and little filler and precursor get access to the intra-bundle areas, which results in a poor stuffing in the inner spaces. And these obstructed Ti3SiC2 filler can also weaken the interfacial bonding of the matrix and fibers. As a result, the flexural strength of the composites degrades as the filler content exceed 9wt%, and long fibers pull-out are observed when the filler content is 15wt%. It can be confirmed that the appropriate Ti3SiC2 content can effectively tailor the density and interfacial bonding of SiCf/SiC composites during the infiltration and pyrolysis process, therefore the infiltration efficiency and flexural strength are enhanced. 3.2 Dielectric properties of SiCf/SiC composites with Ti3SiC2 filler As is known, Ti3SiC2 possesses an excellent electrical property, thus it can be introduced into the low dielectric-loss ceramic to tailor the dielectric property of the composites [27,28]. First, the complex permittivity of the various components of SiCf/SiC composites is shown in Fig. 6. As the previous study manifests that the PIP-SiC is incompletely crystalline and remains excess carbon [29,30], the pyrolyzed-SiC/paraffin composites show low ε′ (4–6) and ε″ (2–2.5) values. And the complex permittivity of as-received Ti3SiC2 varies from 9–i0.5 to 11.5–i3.1. In order to investigate the transformation of Ti3SiC2 during the pyrolysis process, the Ti3SiC2 filler was heat treated at 1100°C for 2h in vacuum. The results display that the complex permittivity of Ti3SiC2 filler are almost the same before and after heat treatment, indicating the stability of Ti3SiC2 during the heat treatment process. This can also be supported by the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 7. The diffraction peaks of Ti3SiC2 show no obvious difference before and after heat treatment, and the broad peak of PIP-SiC matrix is independent of the diffraction peaks of Ti3SiC2 for the pyrolyzed SiC with 9wt% Ti3SiC2. In addition, Fig. 6 gives the complex permittivity of as-received KD-I SiC preform, which exhibits high ε′ value of 13–14 and ε″ value of 11–17. This is mainly attributed to the nano-sized PyC surface layer around the KD-I SiC fiber [31], which contributes to enhancing the electrical conductivity and complex permittivity of the SiC fabrics. Fig. 8 shows the complex permittivity of SiCf/SiC composites with different Ti3SiC2 content. The ε′ and ε″ values of the Composite A vary in the range of 13.5–16.5 and 15–19 respectively. The values of both ε′ and ε″ increase as the Ti3SiC2 content increase from 0 to 15wt%. Ultimately, the ε′ and ε″ values increase to 27.5–32.5 and 31.5–39 respectively for the Composite F. Moreover, the frequency response effect of ε′ and ε″ for all the composites can be obviously observed over the whole X band. Based on the Debye theory, the ε′ of complex permittivity is related to polarization. For the well-distributed composites, the ε′ can be characterized according to the Lichtencker׳s logarithmic equation as follows [32,33] (2) Ln ε ′=∑ i V i × Ln ε i ′ where V i is the volume fraction of each component of the composites; ε′ i is the ε′ of each component of the composites. The components of SiCf/SiC composites with Ti3SiC2 filler are mainly composed of KD-I SiC fibers, PIP-SiC matrix, Ti3SiC2 filler and the pores. In the present study, the volume fractions of SiC fibers of these composites are approximately the same, thus the distinctions of complex permittivity are mostly determined by the contents of SiC matrix, Ti3SiC2 filler and pores. On one hand, the Ti3SiC2 filler with a relative high ε′ value contributes to enhancing the ε′ of SiCf/SiC composites progressively with the increasing Ti3SiC2 content. On the other hand, with the incorporation of Ti3SiC2 filler, a large number of interfaces are formed between the SiC matrix and Ti3SiC2 particles. These free electrons gathered in the interfaces can form space-charge layer under the applied external electric field, which will help to enhance the ε′ value. The ε″ is usually associated with the electrical conductivity of the composites and can be expressed by the following equation: (3) ε ″ ≈ σ 2 π ε 0 f where σ is the electrical conductivity of the composites, ε 0 is the dielectric constant in vacuum and f is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave. Accordingly, the ε″ is appropriately proportional to the σ, and thus the increment of σ leads to a high ε″ value. As shown in Table 2, the σ increases from 0.05S/cm to 0.89S/cm as the Ti3SiC2 content increase from 0 to 15wt%, thus giving rise to the increment of the ε″ value. The experimental results in Fig. 8 and Table 2 show that the increasing Ti3SiC2 content significantly influence the complex permittivity and conductivity of the SiCf/SiC composites, especially when the filler content exceed 9wt%. Accordingly, all these factors are directly related to the σ of the composites. And the σ is related to the content, geometrical characteristic and extent of agglomeration of the Ti3SiC2 particles in the SiC matrix [34,35]. According to the percolation theory, the σ can be expressed by the following relationship [36,37]: (4) σ ∝ ( W − W c ) α where W is the content of the filler; W c is the critical content or percolation threshold of the filler and α is the critical electrical conductivity exponent. This relationship well illustrates the monotonically increasing dependence between the filler content and the σ shown in Table 2. In addition, the Ti3SiC2 particles disperse in a large scale and these particles are kept at a relative long distance with each other, which cannot form the effective conductive network. Thus the σ and ε″ show a rather small increasing extent when the filler content are below 9wt%. However, as the Ti3SiC2 content exceed 9wt%, these particles get closer and even aggregate together to form conductive network in the composites, leading to an apparent enhancement of the σ and ε″. Therefore, both the conductivity and complex permittivity show a relative large increasing extent for the Ti3SiC2 content exceeding 9wt%.

Mechanical Properties Of Sicf/sic Composites With Ti3sic2 Filler:
Fig. 1 shows the SEM morphology and EDS analysis of the Ti3SiC2 filler. The Ti3SiC2 particles are mostly irregular laminar and granular flakes with the diameters of 0.5–2μm, and the large bodies are aggregated by those sub-micron particles.

3.2 Dielectric properties of SiCf/SiC composites with Ti3SiC2 filler
As is known, Ti3SiC2 possesses an excellent electrical property, thus it can be introduced into the low dielectric-loss ceramic to tailor the dielectric property of the composites [27,28]. First, the complex permittivity of the various components of SiCf/SiC composites is shown in Fig. 6.

The results display that the complex permittivity of Ti3SiC2 filler are almost the same before and after heat treatment, indicating the stability of Ti3SiC2 during the heat treatment process. This can also be supported by the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 7. The diffraction peaks of Ti3SiC2 show no obvious difference before and after heat treatment, and the broad peak of PIP-SiC matrix is independent of the diffraction peaks of Ti3SiC2 for the pyrolyzed SiC with 9wt% Ti3SiC2. In addition, Fig. 6 gives the complex permittivity of as-received KD-I SiC preform, which exhibits high ε′ value of 13–14 and ε″ value of 11–17. This is mainly attributed to the nano-sized PyC surface layer around the KD-I SiC fiber [31], which contributes to enhancing the electrical conductivity and complex permittivity of the SiC fabrics.
Fig. 8 shows the complex permittivity of SiCf/SiC composites with different Ti3SiC2 content. The ε′ and ε″ values of the Composite A vary in the range of 13.5–16.5 and 15–19 respectively. The values of both ε′ and ε″ increase as the Ti3SiC2 content increase from 0 to 15wt%. Ultimately, the ε′ and ε″ values increase to 27.5–32.5 and 31.5–39 respectively for the Composite F. Moreover, the frequency response effect of ε′ and ε″ for all the composites can be obviously observed over the whole X band.
Based on the Debye theory, the ε′ of complex permittivity is related to polarization. For the well-distributed composites, the ε′ can be characterized according to the Lichtencker׳s logarithmic equation as follows [32,33] (2) Ln ε ′=∑ i V i × Ln ε i ′ where V i is the volume fraction of each component of the composites; ε′ i is the ε′ of each component of the composites. The components of SiCf/SiC composites with Ti3SiC2 filler are mainly composed of KD-I SiC fibers, PIP-SiC matrix, Ti3SiC2 filler and the pores. In the present study, the volume fractions of SiC fibers of these composites are approximately the same, thus the distinctions of complex permittivity are mostly determined by the contents of SiC matrix, Ti3SiC2 filler and pores. On one hand, the Ti3SiC2 filler with a relative high ε′ value contributes to enhancing the ε′ of SiCf/SiC composites progressively with the increasing Ti3SiC2 content. On the other hand, with the incorporation of Ti3SiC2 filler, a large number of interfaces are formed between the SiC matrix and Ti3SiC2 particles. These free electrons gathered in the interfaces can form space-charge layer under the applied external electric field, which will help to enhance the ε′ value. The ε″ is usually associated with the electrical conductivity of the composites and can be expressed by the following equation: (3) ε ″ ≈ σ 2 π ε 0 f where σ is the electrical conductivity of the composites, ε 0 is the dielectric constant in vacuum and f is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave. Accordingly, the ε″ is appropriately proportional to the σ, and thus the increment of σ leads to a high ε″ value. As shown in Table 2, the σ increases from 0.05S/cm to 0.89S/cm as the Ti3SiC2 content increase from 0 to 15wt%, thus giving rise to the increment of the ε″ value.
The experimental results in Fig. 8 and Table 2 show that the increasing Ti3SiC2 content significantly influence the complex permittivity and conductivity of the SiCf/SiC composites, especially when the filler content exceed 9wt%. Accordingly, all these factors are directly related to the σ of the composites. And the σ is related to the content, geometrical characteristic and extent of agglomeration of the Ti3SiC2 particles in the SiC matrix [34,35]. According to the percolation theory, the σ can be expressed by the following relationship [36,37]: (4) σ ∝ ( W − W c ) α where W is the content of the filler; W c is the critical content or percolation threshold of the filler and α is the critical electrical conductivity exponent. This relationship well illustrates the monotonically increasing dependence between the filler content and the σ shown in Table 2. In addition, the Ti3SiC2 particles disperse in a large scale and these particles are kept at a relative long distance with each other, which cannot form the effective conductive network. Thus the σ and ε″ show a rather small increasing extent when the filler content are below 9wt%. However, as the Ti3SiC2 content exceed 9wt%, these particles get closer and even aggregate together to form conductive network in the composites, leading to an apparent enhancement of the σ and ε″. Therefore, both the conductivity and complex permittivity show a relative large increasing extent for the Ti3SiC2 content exceeding 9wt%.

Conclusions:
In the present study, the Ti3SiC2 inert filler was successfully introduced into the 2.5D KD-I SiCf/SiC composites by precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) process to optimize the mechanical and dielectric properties. The microstructural evolutions of the matrix and composites varying with the Ti3SiC2 content were characterized. The results indicate that the appropriate Ti3SiC2 content in the infiltration precursor results in a high infiltration efficiency and low open porosity of SiCf/SiC composites. Moreover, the Ti3SiC2 filler can compensate for volume shrinkage and help to form a dense matrix. The flexural strengths of the composites increase firstly and then degrade as the Ti3SiC2 content increase from 0 to 15wt%. Consequently, the maximum flexural strength reaches 273MPa when the filler content is 9wt%, which is 131% higher than that of the composites without filler (118MPa). Both the ε′ and ε″ values show an increasing tendency and vary from 13.5–16.5 to 27.5–32.5 and i15–i19 to i31.5–i39 respectively as the filler content increase from 0 to 15wt%. Owing to the percolation threshold effect of the filler, the conductivity and complex permittivity of SiCf/SiC composites show a relative large increasing extent for the Ti3SiC2 content exceeding 9wt%.

Body:
The increasing applications of continuous SiC fiber-reinforced SiC matrix composites (SiCf/SiC composites) make it extremely important to develop advanced composites with superior characteristics such as excellent mechanical property, good thermostability, low density, and special electrical and dielectric properties [1–3]. Regarding the typical fabrication methods of SiCf/SiC composites, precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) process is of great importance, which has been widely employed because of its easy adaptability for large-scale components with complex shapes, controllable microstructure and low cost of fabrication [4,5]. Polycarbosilane (PCS) is a kind of common precursor of SiC matrix for the PIP process, and multiple infiltration-curing-pyrolysis cycles are required to densify the composites. However, the gas evolution and volume shrinkage of simplex PCS precursor during the pyrolysis process can result in a low densification efficiency and high porosity of the SiC matrix, which will lead to the generation of microcracks and degradation of mechanical properties for SiCf/SiC composites [6,7]. Effective consolidation to eliminate pores and cracks is a very important technical issue for making high-performance composites. Many efforts have been done to improve the density of the composites during the PIP process, including developing new precursors with high ceramic yield [8,9], incorporating active and inert fillers to decrease the volume shrinkage [10,11] and combining the PIP process with other methods [12,13]. Particularly, it is an effective and controllable way to make strong and homogeneous matrices with low porosity for SiCf/SiC composites by introducing inert filler into the PCS precursor [14–17]. Titanium silicon carbide (Ti3SiC2) is a spotlighted material for many engineering applications owing to its nano-laminate structure, good electrical and thermal conductivities, low specific gravity (~4.5g/cm3), and excellent oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures [18,19]. Several papers have reported the efforts to introduce Ti3SiC2 into the fiber-reinforced composites in recent years. Fan et al. [20] fabricated the C/SiC–Ti3SiC2 composites by joint processes of slurry infiltration and liquid silicon infiltration (LSI) using TiC–C slurry. Spencer et al. [21] prepared the SiC fiber-reinforced Ti3SiC2 matrix composites by the hot isostatic pressing (HIP) method. Yang et al. [22] fabricated the Cf/Ti3SiC2–SiC composites by the PIP process using Ti3SiC2 as the inert filler, and the Ti3SiC2 was introduced by in-situ reaction between Ti and polycarbosilane mixtures. However, up to now, little consideration was given on the fabrication of SiCf/SiC composites by the PIP method using Ti3SiC2 powders as inert filler.

In the present work, Ti3SiC2 was introduced into the PCS precursor as inert filler to optimize the mechanical and dielectric properties of 2.5D SiCf/SiC composites. The microstructural evolutions of the matrix and composites varying with the Ti3SiC2 content were characterized. The density, mechanical property and complex permittivity of the composites were investigated.

The 2.5D KD-I SiC fabrics with a volume fraction of 40%, provided by National University of Defense Technology, China, were used as the reinforcement. General characteristics of the KD-I SiC fibers were shown in Ref. [23]. PCS powders with an average molecular weight of 1800, provided by National University of Defense Technology, were used as the polymer precursor of SiC matrix, and xylene was used as the solvent of PCS. Ti3SiC2 powders were supplied by Jinghe Chemical Reagent Factory, Hebei, China, and the purity is greater than 98%. The density and electrical conductivity of Ti3SiC2 powders were 4.5g/cm3 and 4.0×106 S/m respectively.

Prior to the composites preparation, PCS and Ti3SiC2 powders were firstly mixed together following the mass ratios shown in Table 1, and then ball-milled for 12h. The mixture was dispersed in xylene respectively and ultrasonically stirred for 30min in order to mix sufficiently. Thus, the homogeneous slurries with different mass fractions of Ti3SiC2 were obtained. Subsequently, the multiple fabrics were separately put into an airtight vessel and infiltrated with various slurries in vacuum. Then the samples were diverted into an autoclave and 6MPa nitrogen atmosphere was filled in, and this condition was maintained for 20min. After infiltration, the samples were dried and thermally cross-linked at 180°C for 2h in air. Eventually, these samples were heated at 1100°C and held for 2h in a vacuum sintering furnace (ZRS-150, Sante, Jinzhou, China). Each sample was subjected to several PIP cycles until the mass gains of the final composites were less than 1wt% and these fabricated composites were designated as Composite A, B, C, D, E and F, respectively.

The structures of the components of SiCf/SiC composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (X׳Pert PRO MPD, PANalytical, Almelo, The Netherlands) and Raman spectroscopy (LabRAM HR800). The fracture surface morphologies of the composites and matrix after three-point bending tests were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Model SUPRA-55, Zeiss, Germany), equipped with energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS).

The densities and open porosities of the fabricated composites were measured by the Archimedes method. The weight of the samples increases after each PIP cycle was measured by an electronic balance. The flexural strength was characterized by three-point bending tests (specimen size of 40 l mm×4 w mm×3 t mm) with a cross-head speed of 0.5mm/min and support span length of 30mm using a universal testing machine (Haida Qualitative Analysis, HD-609B), following the general guidelines of ASTM standard C 1341. Five specimens were evaluated to eliminate the testing deviations. The DC electrical conductivity (σ dc) of the composites was measured by the two-probe direct current method [24], and the testing terminals of the composites were brushed with silver painting to avoid the contact resistance. The σ dc can be calculated by the following equation: (1) σ dc=L / R S where R is the resistance paralleled to the wrap direction of the composites, S is the cross-sectional area of the composites, and L is the length of the composites.

The dielectric properties of SiCf/SiC composites were characterized by the real part (ε′) and imaginary part (ε″) of complex permittivity. Because of the low complex permittivity and melting point of paraffin, the samples of various powders for dielectric property measurements were prepared by mixing the produced powders with paraffin in a mass ratio of 3:1. For the measurement of SiC fabrics, melted paraffin wax was cast into the fabrics to obtain fabrics/paraffin wax composites so that the fiber bundles were fixed to facilitate the measurement of permittivity. The dimensions of the measured SiCf/SiC composites, SiC fabrics and powders/paraffin composites were 22.86 l mm×10.16 w mm×3.0 t mm. The complex permittivity was measured in the frequency range of 8.2–12.4GHz by the waveguide method using a vector network analyzer (E8362B). In addition, the surfaces of the prepared composites were polished before the measurement of complex permittivity in order to remove the agglomerative Ti3SiC2 filler during the PIP process.

Fig. 1 shows the SEM morphology and EDS analysis of the Ti3SiC2 filler. The Ti3SiC2 particles are mostly irregular laminar and granular flakes with the diameters of 0.5–2μm, and the large bodies are aggregated by those sub-micron particles. Thus, the Ti3SiC2 and PCS powders were ball-milled to reduce the aggregations and mix sufficiently. The EDS analysis shows that the Ti3SiC2 consists of 48.96% Ti, 16.32% Si and 34.72% C in atomic molar percentage respectively, and the elemental stoichiometric ratio is close to the nominal Ti3SiC2, further illustrating the purity of Ti3SiC2 phase.

In order to illustrate the effects of Ti3SiC2 content on the densification behavior of SiCf/SiC composites, the weight of these samples increases after each PIP process was monitored and is shown in Fig. 2. It is observed that the PIP cycles of these composites decrease from 14 to 8 as the Ti3SiC2 content vary from 0 to 15wt%, which indicates that the incorporation of Ti3SiC2 significantly improves the infiltration efficiency. The weight increases after the first PIP cycle show distinctive differences and rise with the increasing Ti3SiC2 content. Owing to the increasing Ti3SiC2 content, more pyrolyzed products adhere to the Ti3SiC2 particles and thicker matrix layers are formed in the inter-bundle and intra-bundle areas, thus the infiltration and pyrolysis processes are enhanced.

Fig. 3 shows the typical stress–displacement curves of SiCf/SiC composites with various Ti3SiC2 content. As displayed in Fig. 3, the flexural strengths of the composites increase firstly and then degrade as the Ti3SiC2 content increase from 0 to 15wt%. The results reveal that the Composite A shows a low flexural strength and brittle fracture behavior, while the composites with Ti3SiC2 filler exhibit enhanced flexural strength and failure displacement. Table 2 lists the properties of the fabricated SiCf/SiC composites. It exhibits that the maximum flexural strength reaches 273MPa when the Ti3SiC2 content is 9wt%, while the Composite A is only 118MPa. The typical fracture surface morphologies of various SiCf/SiC composites and matrices are illustrated and shown in Figs. 4 and 5. As seen from Fig. 4, when the Ti3SiC2 content are below 12wt%, the fracture surfaces of the composites are relatively plain, while the composites with 15wt% Ti3SiC2 filler exhibit long fibers pull-out. Especially, the fracture surface of the composites without filler shows obvious large pores owing to the volume shrinkage during the pyrolysis process. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5a, the matrix without filler is divided into plenty of discontinuous fragments and many continuous cracks generate. Thus, theses composites show a low flexural strength and catastrophic failure. For the composites with Ti3SiC2 particles, these inert filler can act as carriers for the growth of SiC matrix, and therefore effectively fill in the large pores and suppress the volume shrinkage effect, especially in the inter-bundle areas. Eventually, these SiCf/SiC composites with Ti3SiC2 filler show an obvious densification behavior, except for some discrete cracks in the matrix shown in Fig. 4. When the filler content is 9wt%, as shown in Fig. 5b and e, a dense and continuous matrix is formed with the filler dispersing uniformly in the SiC substrate, which helps to enhance the resistance of the matrix to external force. In addition, the inner spaces in the intra-bundle areas are mostly filled with the SiC matrix and Ti3SiC2 particles. As a result, the high density and suitable interfacial bonding lead to a high flexural strength [25,26]. As the filler content increase, the Ti3SiC2 particles will aggregate and adhere together by the limited precursor, and considerable micro-pores are left in the matrix after the pyrolysis process. These closed pores cannot be further filled in the following infiltration process, and a loose matrix is formed eventually, as shown in Fig. 5c. On the other hand, most filler are filtered out by the fiber filaments during the infiltration process and little filler and precursor get access to the intra-bundle areas, which results in a poor stuffing in the inner spaces. And these obstructed Ti3SiC2 filler can also weaken the interfacial bonding of the matrix and fibers. As a result, the flexural strength of the composites degrades as the filler content exceed 9wt%, and long fibers pull-out are observed when the filler content is 15wt%. It can be confirmed that the appropriate Ti3SiC2 content can effectively tailor the density and interfacial bonding of SiCf/SiC composites during the infiltration and pyrolysis process, therefore the infiltration efficiency and flexural strength are enhanced.

3.2 Dielectric properties of SiCf/SiC composites with Ti3SiC2 filler

As is known, Ti3SiC2 possesses an excellent electrical property, thus it can be introduced into the low dielectric-loss ceramic to tailor the dielectric property of the composites [27,28]. First, the complex permittivity of the various components of SiCf/SiC composites is shown in Fig. 6. As the previous study manifests that the PIP-SiC is incompletely crystalline and remains excess carbon [29,30], the pyrolyzed-SiC/paraffin composites show low ε′ (4–6) and ε″ (2–2.5) values. And the complex permittivity of as-received Ti3SiC2 varies from 9–i0.5 to 11.5–i3.1. In order to investigate the transformation of Ti3SiC2 during the pyrolysis process, the Ti3SiC2 filler was heat treated at 1100°C for 2h in vacuum. The results display that the complex permittivity of Ti3SiC2 filler are almost the same before and after heat treatment, indicating the stability of Ti3SiC2 during the heat treatment process. This can also be supported by the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 7. The diffraction peaks of Ti3SiC2 show no obvious difference before and after heat treatment, and the broad peak of PIP-SiC matrix is independent of the diffraction peaks of Ti3SiC2 for the pyrolyzed SiC with 9wt% Ti3SiC2. In addition, Fig. 6 gives the complex permittivity of as-received KD-I SiC preform, which exhibits high ε′ value of 13–14 and ε″ value of 11–17. This is mainly attributed to the nano-sized PyC surface layer around the KD-I SiC fiber [31], which contributes to enhancing the electrical conductivity and complex permittivity of the SiC fabrics.

Fig. 8 shows the complex permittivity of SiCf/SiC composites with different Ti3SiC2 content. The ε′ and ε″ values of the Composite A vary in the range of 13.5–16.5 and 15–19 respectively. The values of both ε′ and ε″ increase as the Ti3SiC2 content increase from 0 to 15wt%. Ultimately, the ε′ and ε″ values increase to 27.5–32.5 and 31.5–39 respectively for the Composite F. Moreover, the frequency response effect of ε′ and ε″ for all the composites can be obviously observed over the whole X band.

Based on the Debye theory, the ε′ of complex permittivity is related to polarization. For the well-distributed composites, the ε′ can be characterized according to the Lichtencker׳s logarithmic equation as follows [32,33] (2) Ln ε ′=∑ i V i × Ln ε i ′ where V i is the volume fraction of each component of the composites; ε′ i is the ε′ of each component of the composites. The components of SiCf/SiC composites with Ti3SiC2 filler are mainly composed of KD-I SiC fibers, PIP-SiC matrix, Ti3SiC2 filler and the pores. In the present study, the volume fractions of SiC fibers of these composites are approximately the same, thus the distinctions of complex permittivity are mostly determined by the contents of SiC matrix, Ti3SiC2 filler and pores. On one hand, the Ti3SiC2 filler with a relative high ε′ value contributes to enhancing the ε′ of SiCf/SiC composites progressively with the increasing Ti3SiC2 content. On the other hand, with the incorporation of Ti3SiC2 filler, a large number of interfaces are formed between the SiC matrix and Ti3SiC2 particles. These free electrons gathered in the interfaces can form space-charge layer under the applied external electric field, which will help to enhance the ε′ value. The ε″ is usually associated with the electrical conductivity of the composites and can be expressed by the following equation: (3) ε ″ ≈ σ 2 π ε 0 f where σ is the electrical conductivity of the composites, ε 0 is the dielectric constant in vacuum and f is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave. Accordingly, the ε″ is appropriately proportional to the σ, and thus the increment of σ leads to a high ε″ value. As shown in Table 2, the σ increases from 0.05S/cm to 0.89S/cm as the Ti3SiC2 content increase from 0 to 15wt%, thus giving rise to the increment of the ε″ value.

The experimental results in Fig. 8 and Table 2 show that the increasing Ti3SiC2 content significantly influence the complex permittivity and conductivity of the SiCf/SiC composites, especially when the filler content exceed 9wt%. Accordingly, all these factors are directly related to the σ of the composites. And the σ is related to the content, geometrical characteristic and extent of agglomeration of the Ti3SiC2 particles in the SiC matrix [34,35]. According to the percolation theory, the σ can be expressed by the following relationship [36,37]: (4) σ ∝ ( W − W c ) α where W is the content of the filler; W c is the critical content or percolation threshold of the filler and α is the critical electrical conductivity exponent. This relationship well illustrates the monotonically increasing dependence between the filler content and the σ shown in Table 2. In addition, the Ti3SiC2 particles disperse in a large scale and these particles are kept at a relative long distance with each other, which cannot form the effective conductive network. Thus the σ and ε″ show a rather small increasing extent when the filler content are below 9wt%. However, as the Ti3SiC2 content exceed 9wt%, these particles get closer and even aggregate together to form conductive network in the composites, leading to an apparent enhancement of the σ and ε″. Therefore, both the conductivity and complex permittivity show a relative large increasing extent for the Ti3SiC2 content exceeding 9wt%.

In the present study, the Ti3SiC2 inert filler was successfully introduced into the 2.5D KD-I SiCf/SiC composites by precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) process to optimize the mechanical and dielectric properties. The microstructural evolutions of the matrix and composites varying with the Ti3SiC2 content were characterized. The results indicate that the appropriate Ti3SiC2 content in the infiltration precursor results in a high infiltration efficiency and low open porosity of SiCf/SiC composites. Moreover, the Ti3SiC2 filler can compensate for volume shrinkage and help to form a dense matrix. The flexural strengths of the composites increase firstly and then degrade as the Ti3SiC2 content increase from 0 to 15wt%. Consequently, the maximum flexural strength reaches 273MPa when the filler content is 9wt%, which is 131% higher than that of the composites without filler (118MPa). Both the ε′ and ε″ values show an increasing tendency and vary from 13.5–16.5 to 27.5–32.5 and i15–i19 to i31.5–i39 respectively as the filler content increase from 0 to 15wt%. Owing to the percolation threshold effect of the filler, the conductivity and complex permittivity of SiCf/SiC composites show a relative large increasing extent for the Ti3SiC2 content exceeding 9wt%.

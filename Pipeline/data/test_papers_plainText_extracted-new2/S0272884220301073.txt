Title:
Rapid sintering method for highly conductive Li

Abstract:
Solid electrolytes could address the increasingly urgent safety and energy density concerns of lithium-ion batteries. Among several kinds of solid electrolytes, Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Ta-LLZO) became a research hotspot because of its high Li-ion conductivity and chemical stability against Li-metal and air. However, the preparation of high quality LLZO ceramic electrolyte via conventional air ambient sintering method is still a big challenge due to the serious “Li-loss” and abnormal grain growth phenomenon during the long-time high-temperature sintering process. Herein, a new rapid ultra-high-temperature air ambient sintering method without mother powder (MP) is put forward for the preparation of high quality Ta-LLZO ceramic electrolyte. The rapid sintering strategy can effectively restrain “Li-loss”. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the none-mother-powder method is superior to traditional mother-powder method. Ta-LLZO ceramics sintered without MP via this rapid sintering method own small grain size, tight grain boundary, dense microstructure and high conductivity. Specifically, the Ta-LLZO ceramic sintered at 1360 °C for 10 min without MP exhibits high conductivity (8.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C) and high relative density (97%), which equate those made by hot pressing sintering method. Without MP, the sintering process can avoid a lot of material waste and simplify the operation process. Moreover, the rapid sintering process can sharply shorten sintering time and reduce energy consumption. Therefore, this low-cost high-efficient sintering strategy can be effectively used in the large-scale production of high-quality Ta-LLZO ceramic electrolyte.

Introduction:
The rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs) and powerful electronics demands the Li-ion batteries (LIBs) with much higher energy density and better safety than that of current commercial LIBs. These demands urge the utilization of high voltage cathodes as well as Li anodes [1]. However, there seems to be a trade-off relationship between energy density and safety in currently commercial LIBs based on organic liquid electrolyte which is highly flammable. The Li dendrites in Li-metal batteries can pierce the polymer separator, resulting in short circuit and thus causing safety anxiousness. In addition, uncontrollable chemical reactions occur between the highly reactive cathodes and organic liquid electrolyte, leading to serious safety hazard such as thermal runaway and burning of the cell. Fortunately, solid-state Li batteries are expected to break this trade-off, solve the safety problem fundamentally and boost the energy density of the cell simultaneously.
Among solid-state electrolytes, cubic garnet-structured Li7La3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO) electrolyte became a research hotspot because of its relative high Li-ion conductivity ( σ L i + ) above 1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 298 K, good chemical and electrochemical stability against Li-metal anodes and a wide electrochemical potential window vs. Li/Li+ [2]. Recent studies certificated that high-quality c-LLZO ceramics require pure cubic garnet phase, dense microstructure [3], small grain size [4] and tight grain boundary [5,6]. Cubic phase is the fast ion-conductive phase, whose ionic conductivity is two order magnitudes higher than that of tetragonal phase [7,8]. While a dense microstructure can decrease the grain boundary resistance and increase the total Li+ conductivity (bulk + grain boundary) [3]. It is also reported that small grain LLZO samples exhibit much lower interfacial resistances in Li symmetric cell than those with large grain sizes, and both tight grain boundary and small grains [4] contribute to the endurance towards Li dendrite penetration or the improvement of the cyclability of the cell [5,6]. Moreover, smaller grain size can also improve the mechanical strength of polycrystalline ceramic pellets [6,9].
Nevertheless, it is very hard to prepare high-quality LLZO ceramic electrolyte via conventional pressureless sintering method in air ambient condition, which greatly restrained the extensive research and commercial application of LLZO electrolyte. Conventional air ambient sintering method for LLZO ceramics required high temperature about 1200 °C for a long time to obtain dense sintering body [10]. However, Li2O sublimates at the temperature of higher than 1000 °C and thus the long-time sintering under harsh conditions brings about serious “Li-loss” problem [2,11]. The LLZO will suffer a structural collapse accompanying the formation of pyrochlore phase La2Zr2O7 [12], which reduces the Li-ion conductivity [13]. A typical solution is burying the green body with a large amount of “mother powder” in the Al2O3 crucible to compensate the lithium loss [11]. The raw-material cost will be high because the mother powders contain expensive rare earth element of La and Ta [14]. In addition, abnormal grain growth phenomenon may occur and large “monster” grains can be easily generated after the long time sintering under high temperature [15] which decreases the relative density and mechanical strength of the ceramics [3,6]. Besides, if the sintering temperature is too low, the atomic diffusion will be inhibited, leading to loose grain boundaries and high grain boundary resistance [16]. Some special sintering approaches, such as hot pressing (HP) [17–19], spark plasma sintering (SPS) [20] and field assisted sintering technique (FAST) [21] are used to prepare dense c-LLZO ceramics. The LLZO electrolytes are compacted in a tightly sealed chamber at high pressure [3] and simultaneously sintered with other activation measures. For example, the obtained Li7-xLa3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12-d ceramics prepared by SPS showed a high σ L i + of 1.35 mS cm−1 at 30 °C [20]. However, the equipments of these approaches are complicated and expensive, and the processes are low productive [3,22]. Therefore, a new effective sintering system via air ambient sintering method is urgently needed for preparation of high-quality LLZO ceramics.
As well known, high-temperature sintering is one of the intensified sintering method, in which the higher the sintering temperature is the greater the diffusion coefficient of atoms are and the faster the sintering rate will be. Therefore, further increasing the sintering temperature is expected to complete the densification sintering process of LLZO in a shorter time. If the sintering time is short enough, there will be insufficient chance for Li2O to sublimate in large quantities. Currently, many researchers are mainly focusing on inhibiting lithium volatilization by decreasing the sintering temperature, such as using sol-gel methods [23], sintering additives [22,24,25], or two-step sintering strategy [3,26], but the ionic conductivities of the obtained samples were usually not satisfactory. Hitherto, inhibiting lithium sublimation by shortening sintering time for air ambient sintering method is rarely reported. Herein, a new rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without mother powder via low cost air ambient sintering method is proposed to restrain “Li-loss” and prepare LLZO ceramics with high Li-ion conductivity. Firstly, the feasibility and mechanism of no mother powder method are discussed. The phase, microstructure, σ L i + , and relative density of obtained LLZO ceramic electrolyte are studied to verify the superiority of the new rapid sintering strategy without mother powder. Then, the optimum sintering temperature and time is explored. Through this work, a good guidance is provided for the future preparation of dense LLZO ceramics with high Li-ion conductivity.

Experimental:
2.1 The synthesis of LLZO powders Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (Ta-LLZO) was adopted as the target compound since Ta5+ doping can enhance the stability of cubic phase and improve the σ L i + compared to the undoped LLZO [2,12]. Conventional solid-state reaction route was adopted to prepare Ta-LLZO powders using LiOH·H2O (99%, Adamas), La2O3 (99.9%), ZrO2 (99.99%, Aladdin), Ta2O5 (99.5%, Aladdin) as starting reagents. La2O3 was calcined at 900 °C for 12 h before using to remove the absorbed water and carbon dioxide. Stoichiometric amounts of raw materials were weighed and thoroughly mixed in Zirconia-ball-grinding tank for 6 h with 2-propanol as the grinding media. 10% excess of LiOH·H2O was added in the starting reagents to compensate for Li loss during the preparation process. The obtained slurry was dried in oven and then calcined at 900 °C for 12 h in a MgO crucible to obtain cubic LLZO powders. These powders were ball milled with 2-propanol again at the speed of 200 rpm for 14 h and finally dried to obtain homogeneous fine powders.
2.2 The preparation of ceramics The synthesized fine Ta-LLZO powders were uniaxially pressed into thin green round plates with a diameter of 15 mm under the intensity of pressure of 300 MPa and subsequently sintered in air ambient. MgO crucibles with lids which can form a near-closed system were selected as the sintering furniture because MgO does not react with volatile Li2O even in high temperature. A new rapid ultra-high temperature sintering strategy of 1320 °C × 0.5 h and a traditional schedule of 1200 °C × 12 h from the literatures were adopted and compared to verify the superiority of the new sintering strategy. Two sintering setups with or without mother powder were comparative during sintering process in order to investigate the feasibility and influence of none mother powder (N-MP). The mother powder (MP) owned the same composition as the fine Ta-LLZO powder. After verifying the superiority of the new rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without MP, the sintering schedules of 1280 °C × 60 min, 1320 °C × 30 min, 1360 °C × 10 min, 1400 °C × 1 min were investigated to compare the optimal sintering schedule. The heating and cooling rate were set to be 10 °C/min and 5 °C/min, respectively. After sintered, each pellet was polished by using silicon carbide sand paper from 320 to 5000 grit to a mirror-like finish before characterization.
2.3 Physical and chemical characterization of samples The particle size distribution of the obtained fine powder was characterized by a laser granularity analyzer. The phase components of the Ta-LLZO fine powders and ceramic pellets were determined by a X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS D8, Bruker AXS GmbH), which equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.54178 Å) and a graphite monochromator [27] operated at room temperature between 10° and 70° (2θ) with a scan rate of 0.1°s−1. The total conductivity of the ceramic electrolyte was measured by electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Model Zennium). Both sides of the pellets were sputtered with platinum as the Li+ blocking electrodes. Then, the Pt/LLZO/Pt pellets were placed into a homemade mold and put into a drying oven setting at measuring temperature for 30 min before the test [28]. The frequency ranged from 4 M–10 Hz and an amplitude of 20 mV was set during the measurement of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To determine the activation energy, EIS of each sample was measured over a temperature range of 25 °C–60 °C. The activation energy was calculated from the slope of Arrhenius plot according to the equation σT=Aexp(−E a /kT), wherein E a is the activation energy, σ is the conductivity, T is the absolute temperature, A is the pre-exponential parameter, and k is the Boltzmann constant. The electronic conductivity were examined by using the Pt/LLZO/Pt cell by means of the DC polarization method [29] applying a DC voltage of 4 V. The current was recorded for 21600 s during the polarization. The density of Ta-LLZO pellets were calculated via weight/volume. While the relative density is defined as the ratio of the actual density to the theoretical density, which is calculated from the XRD results (5.41 g cm−3 for Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12). The microstructure morphologies of ceramic pellets on fracture surfaces were imaged by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6610LV) [30], and the microstructural features such as grain size, porosity, and grain boundary integrity were characterized.

The Synthesis Of Llzo Powders:
Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (Ta-LLZO) was adopted as the target compound since Ta5+ doping can enhance the stability of cubic phase and improve the σ L i + compared to the undoped LLZO [2,12]. Conventional solid-state reaction route was adopted to prepare Ta-LLZO powders using LiOH·H2O (99%, Adamas), La2O3 (99.9%), ZrO2 (99.99%, Aladdin), Ta2O5 (99.5%, Aladdin) as starting reagents.

Results And Discussion:
3.1 Influence and mechanism of no mother powder method The particle size distribution of the obtained LLZO fine powders is characterized and shown in Fig. 1 a, which D10, D50 and D90 are 0.173 μm, 0.494 μm and 2.838 μm, respectively. The small particle size means that the powders are fully activated. As shown in Fig. 1b, the Ta-LLZO powder shows a pure c-LLZO phase. Fig. 2 a shows the scheme of two sintering setups without and with mother powder. The optical photographs of as prepared LLZO ceramic electrolytes sintered at different conditions of N-MP@1320 °C × 30 min, MP@1320 °C × 30 min, N-MP@1200 °C × 12 h and MP@1200 °C × 12 h are showed in Fig. 2b. The pellet sintered at the condition of N-MP@1320 °C × 30 min is in deep tan color while at other conditions show light beige color. The deep tan color usually means high-quality sintering of LLZO ceramic in conventional air ambient sintering [31]. The XRD patterns of as prepared ceramic pellets sintered with and without mother powder at different sintering schedules are presented in Fig. 3 a. All pellets sintered with mother powder show a pure c-LLZO phase, demonstrating the effective compensation of Li from mother powder. While the pellet sintered at N-MP@1200 °C × 12 h contains the impurity phase of La2Zr2O7, indicating the long time sintering at this temperature without mother powder brings about serious Li loss and leads to insufficient Li source. However, the pellet sintered at N-MP@1320 °C × 30 min displays pure c-LLZO phase, indicating that the Ta-LLZO is intact and the rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy can effectively restrain Li loss. Without MP, the excess lithium added in the green pellets self-compensate the little Li-loss during the short-time sintering process. Fig. 3b-e shows the cross-section SEM images of Ta-LLZO ceramics sintered with and without mother powders. The Ta-LLZO sample sintered at the condition of MP@1320 °C × 30 min has the morphology of polyhedron grains (with grain sizes of 3–15 μm), all intergranular fracture, clear but loose grain boundaries. While the pellet sintered at N-MP@1320 °C × 30 min exhibits polyhedron grains (with grain sizes of 2–13 μm), dense structure, mixed inter- and trans-granular fracture. The appearance of trans-granular fracture in the pellet indicates that the grains thereof are bonded strongly [14]. The pellet sintered at 1200 °C × 12 h with mother powder owns rough polyhedron grains with sizes of 5–22 μm and some ditches. While the pellet sintered at 1200 °C × 12 h without mother powder shows a few isolated pores and entirely transgranular fracture mode. The cross-section of this pellet was chemically etched for 4 min with HCl solution (1 mol L−1) to reveal the grain boundaries. After HCl corrosion, the sample shows grain sizes of 4–20 μm (Fig. 3f). It can be seen that the ceramics sintered without MP have smaller grain sizes than sintered with MP. These cross-section SEM images also signify that none-mother-powder method can availably improve the microstructure density and strengthen the grain boundary. Fig. 4 shows the EIS curves, total conductivity (σ t) and relative density (R.D.) of Ta-LLZO pellets sintered with and without mother powder. All EIS curves consist of a semicircle in the high frequency region which corresponds to the grain boundaries and a diffusion tail in the low frequency region. The Z′ value of the reflection point in the EIS curves is considered as the total impedance and used to calculate the total conductivity [31,33]. The pellets sintered without MP own higher σ t and R.D. than with MP, while the sample sintered at 1320 °C × 30 min are better than 1200 °C × 12 h (Fig. 4b). Table 1 summarizes the influence of no mother powder under different sintering schedule on the properties of Ta-LLZO ceramics. Especially, it is found that the none-mother-powder method is superior to mother-powder method. Ta-LLZO pellets sintered by the rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without MP show smaller grains, tighter grain boundary, denser microstructure and higher conductivity than sintered with MP. Fig. 5 shows the scheme of sintering behavior and possible mechanism of sintering Ta-LLZO ceramics without or with mother powder. In the early stage of sintering, the in-situ excess Li2O added in the green pellets self-compensate the Li-loss and enhance the densification and grain growth. The densification of Ta-LLZO pellets can be achieved in a very short time at the ultra-high temperature. After densifying, pellets with MP still own abundant lithium atmosphere, in which the grains will continue to grow and lead to large grain sizes [11]. Besides, the excess Li2O in the pellet can not flow out easily with the high lithium atmosphere and will stagnate in the grain boundaries, which will reduce grain boundary strength and lead to loose grain boundaries. LLZO ceramics with large grain sizes and loose grain boundaries will possess low mechanical strength, which is undesirable for solid state battery construction [34]. Without MP, however, the excess Li2O in the green pellet is just enough for the compensation of the Li-loss during the sintering process. The excess Li2O can also flow out easily, so the grain boundaries will be purer and tighter. Moreover, by reason of the low Li2O atmosphere without mother powder, the sintering stage will come to end more quickly, resulting in small grain sizes.
3.2 Optimal sintering schedule The XRD patterns of Ta-LLZO ceramic pellets sintered at 1280 °C × 60 min, 1320 °C × 30 min, 1360 °C × 10 min and 1400 °C × 1 min without MP are shown in Fig. 6 a. All pellets sintered by the rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without MP show pure c-LLZO phase, demonstrating that this sintering strategy can restrain Li loss effectively. Without MP, the in-situ excess Li2O added in the green pellets is sufficient for self-compensating the slight Li loss during the short-time sintering process. Fig. 6b-e shows the cross-section SEM images of different Ta-LLZO ceramics prepared by rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without mother powder at different sintering temperature and time. Table 2 exhibits the properties of these Ta-LLZO ceramics. All these samples have dense microstructure with polyhedron grains and tight grain boundaries. The pellet sintered at the condition of N-MP@1280 °C × 1 h with the longest sintering time shows relative large grain size of 2 -16 μm, while at N-MP@1360 °C × 10 min has small grain sizes of 2–11 μm. When the sintering temperature reaches to 1400 °C, only 1 min of sintering time can lead to abnormal grain growth. Some huge grains with sizes of larger than 100 μm emerge in this pellet. Apparently, this phenomenon indicates that the sintering temperature is too high. It is generally recognized that the equation S=kG −a e −bP can describe the fracture strength of polycrystalline ceramics, where S is the fracture strength, G is the grain size, P is the porosity, and k, a, b are positive constants [9,14]. Deduced from this equation, the huge grains will seriously reduce the strength of the pellet sintered at N-MP@1400 °C × 1 min. Fig. 7 a-b shows the EIS curves, total Li-ion conductivity (σ t) and relative density (R.D.) of Ta-LLZO pellets prepared by rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without mother powder. All EIS curves are consisted of a semicircle which corresponds to the grain boundaries and a diffusion tail in the low frequency region. With the increase of sintering temperature, the R.D. and σ t of Ta-LLZO ceramics increase, and the sintering time will be shortened. Specially, the conductivity of pellet sintered at 1360 °C × 10 min without mother powder reaches as high as 8.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 with a high R.D. of 96.9%, equating those made by hot pressed sintering method [19,35]. The R.D. and σ t of Ta-LLZO ceramic sintered at 1400 °C × 1 min however, decrease to 92.3% and 6.86 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively. The Arrhenius plots for the total conductivity of different Ta-LLZO pellets measured over a temperature range of 25 °C–60 °C are shown in Fig. 7c. The activation energy (Ea) was calculated based on the Arrhenius equation and listed in Table 2. The Ea value of pellets sintered at 1280 °C × 1 h, 1320 °C × 30 min, 1360 °C × 10 min, 1400 °C × 1 min without mother powder is 0.33 eV, 0.30 eV, 0.28 eV and 0.29 eV respectively. The electronic conductivities of these samples measured by DC polarization method are all about 10−8 S cm−1 (Table 2), which are lower than the LLZO ceramics reported in other literatures (10−8-10−7 S cm−1) [36]. Specifically, the pellet sintered at 1360 °C × 10 min owns a low electronic conductivity of 1.24 × 10−8 S cm−1, which is about 5 orders of magnitude lower than the total conductivity. The σ e is negligible compared with σ L i + , indicating that the pellet is a good ionic conductor for electrolyte. As listed in Table 3 , the R.D., σ t and E a of sintered Ta-LLZO pellets are compared with LLZO fabricated by several typical methods from other literatures. Apparently, the rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without mother powder can obtain high quality Ta-LLZO ceramics with high Li-ion conductivity and high relative density via low cost air ambient sintering method, which properties equate those made by hot pressing [19] or field assisted sintering technique. Compared to traditional air ambient sintering method with mother powder, the none-mother-powder method can avoid a lot of raw material waste, greatly reduce material cost and simplify the operation process. Moreover, the rapid sintering process can sharply shorten sintering time, improve preparation efficiency and reduce the energy consumption. Therefore, this low-cost high-efficiency sintering strategy can be effectively used in the large-scale production of high quality LLZO ceramic electrolyte.

Influence And Mechanism Of No Mother Powder Method:
The particle size distribution of the obtained LLZO fine powders is characterized and shown in Fig. 1 a, which D10, D50 and D90 are 0.173 μm, 0.494 μm and 2.838 μm, respectively. The small particle size means that the powders are fully activated. As shown in Fig. 1b, the Ta-LLZO powder shows a pure c-LLZO phase.
Fig. 2 a shows the scheme of two sintering setups without and with mother powder. The optical photographs of as prepared LLZO ceramic electrolytes sintered at different conditions of N-MP@1320 °C × 30 min, MP@1320 °C × 30 min, N-MP@1200 °C × 12 h and MP@1200 °C × 12 h are showed in Fig. 2b. The pellet sintered at the condition of N-MP@1320 °C × 30 min is in deep tan color while at other conditions show light beige color. The deep tan color usually means high-quality sintering of LLZO ceramic in conventional air ambient sintering [31].
The XRD patterns of as prepared ceramic pellets sintered with and without mother powder at different sintering schedules are presented in Fig. 3 a. All pellets sintered with mother powder show a pure c-LLZO phase, demonstrating the effective compensation of Li from mother powder.

The cross-section of this pellet was chemically etched for 4 min with HCl solution (1 mol L−1) to reveal the grain boundaries. After HCl corrosion, the sample shows grain sizes of 4–20 μm (Fig. 3f). It can be seen that the ceramics sintered without MP have smaller grain sizes than sintered with MP. These cross-section SEM images also signify that none-mother-powder method can availably improve the microstructure density and strengthen the grain boundary.
Fig. 4 shows the EIS curves, total conductivity (σ t) and relative density (R.D.) of Ta-LLZO pellets sintered with and without mother powder. All EIS curves consist of a semicircle in the high frequency region which corresponds to the grain boundaries and a diffusion tail in the low frequency region. The Z′ value of the reflection point in the EIS curves is considered as the total impedance and used to calculate the total conductivity [31,33]. The pellets sintered without MP own higher σ t and R.D. than with MP, while the sample sintered at 1320 °C × 30 min are better than 1200 °C × 12 h (Fig. 4b). Table 1 summarizes the influence of no mother powder under different sintering schedule on the properties of Ta-LLZO ceramics.

Moreover, by reason of the low Li2O atmosphere without mother powder, the sintering stage will come to end more quickly, resulting in small grain sizes.

Optimal Sintering Schedule:
The XRD patterns of Ta-LLZO ceramic pellets sintered at 1280 °C × 60 min, 1320 °C × 30 min, 1360 °C × 10 min and 1400 °C × 1 min without MP are shown in Fig. 6 a. All pellets sintered by the rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without MP show pure c-LLZO phase, demonstrating that this sintering strategy can restrain Li loss effectively. Without MP, the in-situ excess Li2O added in the green pellets is sufficient for self-compensating the slight Li loss during the short-time sintering process.
Fig. 6b-e shows the cross-section SEM images of different Ta-LLZO ceramics prepared by rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without mother powder at different sintering temperature and time. Table 2 exhibits the properties of these Ta-LLZO ceramics. All these samples have dense microstructure with polyhedron grains and tight grain boundaries. The pellet sintered at the condition of N-MP@1280 °C × 1 h with the longest sintering time shows relative large grain size of 2 -16 μm, while at N-MP@1360 °C × 10 min has small grain sizes of 2–11 μm. When the sintering temperature reaches to 1400 °C, only 1 min of sintering time can lead to abnormal grain growth. Some huge grains with sizes of larger than 100 μm emerge in this pellet. Apparently, this phenomenon indicates that the sintering temperature is too high. It is generally recognized that the equation S=kG −a e −bP can describe the fracture strength of polycrystalline ceramics, where S is the fracture strength, G is the grain size, P is the porosity, and k, a, b are positive constants [9,14]. Deduced from this equation, the huge grains will seriously reduce the strength of the pellet sintered at N-MP@1400 °C × 1 min.
Fig. 7 a-b shows the EIS curves, total Li-ion conductivity (σ t) and relative density (R.D.) of Ta-LLZO pellets prepared by rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without mother powder. All EIS curves are consisted of a semicircle which corresponds to the grain boundaries and a diffusion tail in the low frequency region. With the increase of sintering temperature, the R.D. and σ t of Ta-LLZO ceramics increase, and the sintering time will be shortened. Specially, the conductivity of pellet sintered at 1360 °C × 10 min without mother powder reaches as high as 8.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 with a high R.D. of 96.9%, equating those made by hot pressed sintering method [19,35]. The R.D. and σ t of Ta-LLZO ceramic sintered at 1400 °C × 1 min however, decrease to 92.3% and 6.86 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively.
The Arrhenius plots for the total conductivity of different Ta-LLZO pellets measured over a temperature range of 25 °C–60 °C are shown in Fig. 7c. The activation energy (Ea) was calculated based on the Arrhenius equation and listed in Table 2. The Ea value of pellets sintered at 1280 °C × 1 h, 1320 °C × 30 min, 1360 °C × 10 min, 1400 °C × 1 min without mother powder is 0.33 eV, 0.30 eV, 0.28 eV and 0.29 eV respectively. The electronic conductivities of these samples measured by DC polarization method are all about 10−8 S cm−1 (Table 2), which are lower than the LLZO ceramics reported in other literatures (10−8-10−7 S cm−1) [36]. Specifically, the pellet sintered at 1360 °C × 10 min owns a low electronic conductivity of 1.24 × 10−8 S cm−1, which is about 5 orders of magnitude lower than the total conductivity. The σ e is negligible compared with σ L i + , indicating that the pellet is a good ionic conductor for electrolyte.
As listed in Table 3 , the R.D., σ t and E a of sintered Ta-LLZO pellets are compared with LLZO fabricated by several typical methods from other literatures. Apparently, the rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without mother powder can obtain high quality Ta-LLZO ceramics with high Li-ion conductivity and high relative density via low cost air ambient sintering method, which properties equate those made by hot pressing [19] or field assisted sintering technique. Compared to traditional air ambient sintering method with mother powder, the none-mother-powder method can avoid a lot of raw material waste, greatly reduce material cost and simplify the operation process. Moreover, the rapid sintering process can sharply shorten sintering time, improve preparation efficiency and reduce the energy consumption. Therefore, this low-cost high-efficiency sintering strategy can be effectively used in the large-scale production of high quality LLZO ceramic electrolyte.

Conclusions:
A rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without mother powder via low cost air ambient sintering method is put forward to prepare high-quality Ta-LLZO ceramics. The rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy can effectively restrain “Li-loss”. Coupled with the near-closed system formed by chemically inert MgO crucibles, the none-mother-powder method become feasible. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the none-mother-powder method is superior to traditional mother-powder method. Ta-LLZO ceramics prepared by the rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without mother powder show small grains, tight grain boundary, dense microstructure and high conductivity. Specifically, the Ta-LLZO ceramic pellets sintered at 1360 °C × 10 min without mother powder exhibits highest conductivity (8.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C) and high relative density (97%), equating those made by hot pressed sintering or spark plasma sintering method. Without mother powder, the sintering process can avoid a lot of raw material waste, greatly reduce material cost and simplify the operation process. Moreover, the rapid sintering process can sharply shorten sintering time, improve preparation efficiency and reduce the energy consumption. Therefore, this novel low-cost high-efficiency sintering strategy may open a new world for the large-scale production of high quality LLZO ceramic.

Body:
The rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs) and powerful electronics demands the Li-ion batteries (LIBs) with much higher energy density and better safety than that of current commercial LIBs. These demands urge the utilization of high voltage cathodes as well as Li anodes [1]. However, there seems to be a trade-off relationship between energy density and safety in currently commercial LIBs based on organic liquid electrolyte which is highly flammable. The Li dendrites in Li-metal batteries can pierce the polymer separator, resulting in short circuit and thus causing safety anxiousness. In addition, uncontrollable chemical reactions occur between the highly reactive cathodes and organic liquid electrolyte, leading to serious safety hazard such as thermal runaway and burning of the cell. Fortunately, solid-state Li batteries are expected to break this trade-off, solve the safety problem fundamentally and boost the energy density of the cell simultaneously.

Among solid-state electrolytes, cubic garnet-structured Li7La3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO) electrolyte became a research hotspot because of its relative high Li-ion conductivity ( σ L i + ) above 1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 298 K, good chemical and electrochemical stability against Li-metal anodes and a wide electrochemical potential window vs. Li/Li+ [2]. Recent studies certificated that high-quality c-LLZO ceramics require pure cubic garnet phase, dense microstructure [3], small grain size [4] and tight grain boundary [5,6]. Cubic phase is the fast ion-conductive phase, whose ionic conductivity is two order magnitudes higher than that of tetragonal phase [7,8]. While a dense microstructure can decrease the grain boundary resistance and increase the total Li+ conductivity (bulk + grain boundary) [3]. It is also reported that small grain LLZO samples exhibit much lower interfacial resistances in Li symmetric cell than those with large grain sizes, and both tight grain boundary and small grains [4] contribute to the endurance towards Li dendrite penetration or the improvement of the cyclability of the cell [5,6]. Moreover, smaller grain size can also improve the mechanical strength of polycrystalline ceramic pellets [6,9].

Nevertheless, it is very hard to prepare high-quality LLZO ceramic electrolyte via conventional pressureless sintering method in air ambient condition, which greatly restrained the extensive research and commercial application of LLZO electrolyte. Conventional air ambient sintering method for LLZO ceramics required high temperature about 1200 °C for a long time to obtain dense sintering body [10]. However, Li2O sublimates at the temperature of higher than 1000 °C and thus the long-time sintering under harsh conditions brings about serious “Li-loss” problem [2,11]. The LLZO will suffer a structural collapse accompanying the formation of pyrochlore phase La2Zr2O7 [12], which reduces the Li-ion conductivity [13]. A typical solution is burying the green body with a large amount of “mother powder” in the Al2O3 crucible to compensate the lithium loss [11]. The raw-material cost will be high because the mother powders contain expensive rare earth element of La and Ta [14]. In addition, abnormal grain growth phenomenon may occur and large “monster” grains can be easily generated after the long time sintering under high temperature [15] which decreases the relative density and mechanical strength of the ceramics [3,6]. Besides, if the sintering temperature is too low, the atomic diffusion will be inhibited, leading to loose grain boundaries and high grain boundary resistance [16]. Some special sintering approaches, such as hot pressing (HP) [17–19], spark plasma sintering (SPS) [20] and field assisted sintering technique (FAST) [21] are used to prepare dense c-LLZO ceramics. The LLZO electrolytes are compacted in a tightly sealed chamber at high pressure [3] and simultaneously sintered with other activation measures. For example, the obtained Li7-xLa3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12-d ceramics prepared by SPS showed a high σ L i + of 1.35 mS cm−1 at 30 °C [20]. However, the equipments of these approaches are complicated and expensive, and the processes are low productive [3,22]. Therefore, a new effective sintering system via air ambient sintering method is urgently needed for preparation of high-quality LLZO ceramics.

As well known, high-temperature sintering is one of the intensified sintering method, in which the higher the sintering temperature is the greater the diffusion coefficient of atoms are and the faster the sintering rate will be. Therefore, further increasing the sintering temperature is expected to complete the densification sintering process of LLZO in a shorter time. If the sintering time is short enough, there will be insufficient chance for Li2O to sublimate in large quantities. Currently, many researchers are mainly focusing on inhibiting lithium volatilization by decreasing the sintering temperature, such as using sol-gel methods [23], sintering additives [22,24,25], or two-step sintering strategy [3,26], but the ionic conductivities of the obtained samples were usually not satisfactory. Hitherto, inhibiting lithium sublimation by shortening sintering time for air ambient sintering method is rarely reported. Herein, a new rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without mother powder via low cost air ambient sintering method is proposed to restrain “Li-loss” and prepare LLZO ceramics with high Li-ion conductivity. Firstly, the feasibility and mechanism of no mother powder method are discussed. The phase, microstructure, σ L i + , and relative density of obtained LLZO ceramic electrolyte are studied to verify the superiority of the new rapid sintering strategy without mother powder. Then, the optimum sintering temperature and time is explored. Through this work, a good guidance is provided for the future preparation of dense LLZO ceramics with high Li-ion conductivity.

Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (Ta-LLZO) was adopted as the target compound since Ta5+ doping can enhance the stability of cubic phase and improve the σ L i + compared to the undoped LLZO [2,12]. Conventional solid-state reaction route was adopted to prepare Ta-LLZO powders using LiOH·H2O (99%, Adamas), La2O3 (99.9%), ZrO2 (99.99%, Aladdin), Ta2O5 (99.5%, Aladdin) as starting reagents. La2O3 was calcined at 900 °C for 12 h before using to remove the absorbed water and carbon dioxide. Stoichiometric amounts of raw materials were weighed and thoroughly mixed in Zirconia-ball-grinding tank for 6 h with 2-propanol as the grinding media. 10% excess of LiOH·H2O was added in the starting reagents to compensate for Li loss during the preparation process. The obtained slurry was dried in oven and then calcined at 900 °C for 12 h in a MgO crucible to obtain cubic LLZO powders. These powders were ball milled with 2-propanol again at the speed of 200 rpm for 14 h and finally dried to obtain homogeneous fine powders.

The synthesized fine Ta-LLZO powders were uniaxially pressed into thin green round plates with a diameter of 15 mm under the intensity of pressure of 300 MPa and subsequently sintered in air ambient. MgO crucibles with lids which can form a near-closed system were selected as the sintering furniture because MgO does not react with volatile Li2O even in high temperature. A new rapid ultra-high temperature sintering strategy of 1320 °C × 0.5 h and a traditional schedule of 1200 °C × 12 h from the literatures were adopted and compared to verify the superiority of the new sintering strategy. Two sintering setups with or without mother powder were comparative during sintering process in order to investigate the feasibility and influence of none mother powder (N-MP). The mother powder (MP) owned the same composition as the fine Ta-LLZO powder. After verifying the superiority of the new rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without MP, the sintering schedules of 1280 °C × 60 min, 1320 °C × 30 min, 1360 °C × 10 min, 1400 °C × 1 min were investigated to compare the optimal sintering schedule. The heating and cooling rate were set to be 10 °C/min and 5 °C/min, respectively. After sintered, each pellet was polished by using silicon carbide sand paper from 320 to 5000 grit to a mirror-like finish before characterization.

The particle size distribution of the obtained fine powder was characterized by a laser granularity analyzer. The phase components of the Ta-LLZO fine powders and ceramic pellets were determined by a X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS D8, Bruker AXS GmbH), which equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.54178 Å) and a graphite monochromator [27] operated at room temperature between 10° and 70° (2θ) with a scan rate of 0.1°s−1.

The total conductivity of the ceramic electrolyte was measured by electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Model Zennium). Both sides of the pellets were sputtered with platinum as the Li+ blocking electrodes. Then, the Pt/LLZO/Pt pellets were placed into a homemade mold and put into a drying oven setting at measuring temperature for 30 min before the test [28]. The frequency ranged from 4 M–10 Hz and an amplitude of 20 mV was set during the measurement of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

To determine the activation energy, EIS of each sample was measured over a temperature range of 25 °C–60 °C. The activation energy was calculated from the slope of Arrhenius plot according to the equation σT=Aexp(−E a /kT), wherein E a is the activation energy, σ is the conductivity, T is the absolute temperature, A is the pre-exponential parameter, and k is the Boltzmann constant. The electronic conductivity were examined by using the Pt/LLZO/Pt cell by means of the DC polarization method [29] applying a DC voltage of 4 V. The current was recorded for 21600 s during the polarization.

The density of Ta-LLZO pellets were calculated via weight/volume. While the relative density is defined as the ratio of the actual density to the theoretical density, which is calculated from the XRD results (5.41 g cm−3 for Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12). The microstructure morphologies of ceramic pellets on fracture surfaces were imaged by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6610LV) [30], and the microstructural features such as grain size, porosity, and grain boundary integrity were characterized.

The particle size distribution of the obtained LLZO fine powders is characterized and shown in Fig. 1 a, which D10, D50 and D90 are 0.173 μm, 0.494 μm and 2.838 μm, respectively. The small particle size means that the powders are fully activated. As shown in Fig. 1b, the Ta-LLZO powder shows a pure c-LLZO phase.

Fig. 2 a shows the scheme of two sintering setups without and with mother powder. The optical photographs of as prepared LLZO ceramic electrolytes sintered at different conditions of N-MP@1320 °C × 30 min, MP@1320 °C × 30 min, N-MP@1200 °C × 12 h and MP@1200 °C × 12 h are showed in Fig. 2b. The pellet sintered at the condition of N-MP@1320 °C × 30 min is in deep tan color while at other conditions show light beige color. The deep tan color usually means high-quality sintering of LLZO ceramic in conventional air ambient sintering [31].

The XRD patterns of as prepared ceramic pellets sintered with and without mother powder at different sintering schedules are presented in Fig. 3 a. All pellets sintered with mother powder show a pure c-LLZO phase, demonstrating the effective compensation of Li from mother powder. While the pellet sintered at N-MP@1200 °C × 12 h contains the impurity phase of La2Zr2O7, indicating the long time sintering at this temperature without mother powder brings about serious Li loss and leads to insufficient Li source. However, the pellet sintered at N-MP@1320 °C × 30 min displays pure c-LLZO phase, indicating that the Ta-LLZO is intact and the rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy can effectively restrain Li loss. Without MP, the excess lithium added in the green pellets self-compensate the little Li-loss during the short-time sintering process.

Fig. 3b-e shows the cross-section SEM images of Ta-LLZO ceramics sintered with and without mother powders. The Ta-LLZO sample sintered at the condition of MP@1320 °C × 30 min has the morphology of polyhedron grains (with grain sizes of 3–15 μm), all intergranular fracture, clear but loose grain boundaries. While the pellet sintered at N-MP@1320 °C × 30 min exhibits polyhedron grains (with grain sizes of 2–13 μm), dense structure, mixed inter- and trans-granular fracture. The appearance of trans-granular fracture in the pellet indicates that the grains thereof are bonded strongly [14]. The pellet sintered at 1200 °C × 12 h with mother powder owns rough polyhedron grains with sizes of 5–22 μm and some ditches. While the pellet sintered at 1200 °C × 12 h without mother powder shows a few isolated pores and entirely transgranular fracture mode. The cross-section of this pellet was chemically etched for 4 min with HCl solution (1 mol L−1) to reveal the grain boundaries. After HCl corrosion, the sample shows grain sizes of 4–20 μm (Fig. 3f). It can be seen that the ceramics sintered without MP have smaller grain sizes than sintered with MP. These cross-section SEM images also signify that none-mother-powder method can availably improve the microstructure density and strengthen the grain boundary.

Fig. 4 shows the EIS curves, total conductivity (σ t) and relative density (R.D.) of Ta-LLZO pellets sintered with and without mother powder. All EIS curves consist of a semicircle in the high frequency region which corresponds to the grain boundaries and a diffusion tail in the low frequency region. The Z′ value of the reflection point in the EIS curves is considered as the total impedance and used to calculate the total conductivity [31,33]. The pellets sintered without MP own higher σ t and R.D. than with MP, while the sample sintered at 1320 °C × 30 min are better than 1200 °C × 12 h (Fig. 4b). Table 1 summarizes the influence of no mother powder under different sintering schedule on the properties of Ta-LLZO ceramics.

Especially, it is found that the none-mother-powder method is superior to mother-powder method. Ta-LLZO pellets sintered by the rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without MP show smaller grains, tighter grain boundary, denser microstructure and higher conductivity than sintered with MP. Fig. 5 shows the scheme of sintering behavior and possible mechanism of sintering Ta-LLZO ceramics without or with mother powder. In the early stage of sintering, the in-situ excess Li2O added in the green pellets self-compensate the Li-loss and enhance the densification and grain growth. The densification of Ta-LLZO pellets can be achieved in a very short time at the ultra-high temperature. After densifying, pellets with MP still own abundant lithium atmosphere, in which the grains will continue to grow and lead to large grain sizes [11]. Besides, the excess Li2O in the pellet can not flow out easily with the high lithium atmosphere and will stagnate in the grain boundaries, which will reduce grain boundary strength and lead to loose grain boundaries. LLZO ceramics with large grain sizes and loose grain boundaries will possess low mechanical strength, which is undesirable for solid state battery construction [34]. Without MP, however, the excess Li2O in the green pellet is just enough for the compensation of the Li-loss during the sintering process. The excess Li2O can also flow out easily, so the grain boundaries will be purer and tighter. Moreover, by reason of the low Li2O atmosphere without mother powder, the sintering stage will come to end more quickly, resulting in small grain sizes.

The XRD patterns of Ta-LLZO ceramic pellets sintered at 1280 °C × 60 min, 1320 °C × 30 min, 1360 °C × 10 min and 1400 °C × 1 min without MP are shown in Fig. 6 a. All pellets sintered by the rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without MP show pure c-LLZO phase, demonstrating that this sintering strategy can restrain Li loss effectively. Without MP, the in-situ excess Li2O added in the green pellets is sufficient for self-compensating the slight Li loss during the short-time sintering process.

Fig. 6b-e shows the cross-section SEM images of different Ta-LLZO ceramics prepared by rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without mother powder at different sintering temperature and time. Table 2 exhibits the properties of these Ta-LLZO ceramics. All these samples have dense microstructure with polyhedron grains and tight grain boundaries.

When the sintering temperature reaches to 1400 °C, only 1 min of sintering time can lead to abnormal grain growth. Some huge grains with sizes of larger than 100 μm emerge in this pellet. Apparently, this phenomenon indicates that the sintering temperature is too high. It is generally recognized that the equation S=kG −a e −bP can describe the fracture strength of polycrystalline ceramics, where S is the fracture strength, G is the grain size, P is the porosity, and k, a, b are positive constants [9,14]. Deduced from this equation, the huge grains will seriously reduce the strength of the pellet sintered at N-MP@1400 °C × 1 min.

Fig. 7 a-b shows the EIS curves, total Li-ion conductivity (σ t) and relative density (R.D.) of Ta-LLZO pellets prepared by rapid ultra-high-temperature sintering strategy without mother powder. All EIS curves are consisted of a semicircle which corresponds to the grain boundaries and a diffusion tail in the low frequency region. With the increase of sintering temperature, the R.D. and σ t of Ta-LLZO ceramics increase, and the sintering time will be shortened. Specially, the conductivity of pellet sintered at 1360 °C × 10 min without mother powder reaches as high as 8.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 with a high R.D. of 96.9%, equating those made by hot pressed sintering method [19,35]. The R.D. and σ t of Ta-LLZO ceramic sintered at 1400 °C × 1 min however, decrease to 92.3% and 6.86 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively.

The Arrhenius plots for the total conductivity of different Ta-LLZO pellets measured over a temperature range of 25 °C–60 °C are shown in Fig. 7c. The activation energy (Ea) was calculated based on the Arrhenius equation and listed in Table 2. The Ea value of pellets sintered at 1280 °C × 1 h, 1320 °C × 30 min, 1360 °C × 10 min, 1400 °C × 1 min without mother powder is 0.33 eV, 0.30 eV, 0.28 eV and 0.29 eV respectively.

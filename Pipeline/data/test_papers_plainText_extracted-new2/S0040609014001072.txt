Title:
On the direct current electric conductivity and conduction mechanism of some stable disubstituted 4-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium ylides in thin films

Abstract:
Temperature-dependent d.c. electric conductivity of some recently synthesized organic compounds, stable disubstituted 4-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium ylides, is studied. Thin-film samples (d=0.100.80μm) spin-coated from dimethylformamide solutions onto glass substrates have been used. Organic films with reproducible electron transport properties can be obtained if, after deposition, they are submitted to a heat treatment within temperature range of 297 − 527K. The studied polycrystalline compounds exhibit typical n-type semiconductor behavior. The activation energy of the electric conduction ranges between 0.59 and 0.94eV. Some correlations between semiconducting parameters and molecular structure of the organic compounds have been discussed. In the higher temperature range (T >400K), the electron transport in examined compounds can be interpreted in terms of the band gap representation model, while in the lower temperature range, the Mott's variable-range hopping conduction model was found to be appropriate. Some of the investigated compounds hold promise for thermistor applications.

Introduction:
Organic semiconductors represent a class of advanced electronic materials, which was largely explored over the last few decades. They occupy a prominent place in contemporary research topic and constitute one of the most promising research directions in the near future, own to their important untapped theoretical and application potential. This field exhibited a rapid development during the last years, due to an ample worldwide research effort tackling multiple aspects, ranging from material synthesis and growth (single crystals, thin films and nanostructures), study of optical, electron transport, photophysical and photochemical properties, to a wide range of technological applications [1–3].
Molecular configuration of organic semiconducting compounds is characterized by the presence of extended π-electron systems that can be easily tuned through the molecular structure modification (chemical substitution). Own to their suitability to ‘molecular tailoring’, more than twenty millions of such organic compounds have been reported to be synthesized to date [4].
Organic semiconducting materials exhibit important physical properties: significant electroluminescence, high mobilities of charge carriers, energy band gap in the IR–vis domain, etc., which can be modified, to a rather large extent, due to their chemical tunability. These compounds also display high processability (e.g. spin-coating, printing, evaporation) and versatility, easy shaping and manufacture, as well as compatibility with mechanically flexible substrates and facile integration with divers physical, chemical and biological functionalities [5,6]. Due to their remarkable characteristics, organic semiconductors have proven attractive for divers solid-state device applications: light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic cells, lasers, sensors, as well as in nanoelectronics, transparent electronics, and electro-optics [7]. A series of other various applications has been also envisaged, like flexible displays, solid state lighting, smart cards, and radio-frequency identification tags. In this way, organic semiconductors are considered as a credible alternative (from technical and economical point of view) to inorganic semiconductors for the manufacture of large-area electronic products on flexible substrates (flexible and low-cost ‘plastic’ electronics) [8,9].
Due to several significant advantages (e.g. higher mechanical properties [10]), small-molecule organic semiconductors in thin films, with controllable structural order and properties, are normally preferred to the organic single crystals in most of electronic and optoelectronic applications. Besides, the mobility of the charge carriers in active small-molecule organic materials, which largely determines the performance of the organic electronic and optoelectronic devices, stands roughly one order of magnitude above that of polymeric semiconductors, due to a more facile control of electron transport properties, facilitated by their chemical tunability, especially in the case of polycrystalline thin films [10,11].
The electron transport properties of semiconductor materials employed as active components in organic semiconductor devices are strongly influenced by the features of their chemical structure, particularly, by the molecular packing, which significantly affects the molecular orbital shapes and interactions [12,13].
In our previous papers [14–21] we studied the electronic transport and optical properties for a great number of organic compounds, for which a typical semiconducting behavior was found. In this paper, we extend these investigations to some recently synthesized organic compounds, stable disubstituted 4-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium ylides [22], in form of polycrystalline thin films. Disubstituted cycloimmonium ylides have a great potential for use as analytical reagents or semiconducting materials [15,23,24] and some of them have been shown to display biological activity [25,26]. Cycloimmonium ylides are also used in the synthesis of ylidic polymers having specific properties [27].

Experimental Details:
2.1 Synthesis of compounds Pyridinium ylides under study derived from 4,4’-bipyridine were synthesized using in the first step, the salt method of Kröhnke [28]. Thus, the monobromides S1 − S4 [29,30] were dissolved in water and treated with aqueous 0.2N NaOH solution. The obtained suspension was centrifuged and the monosubstituted ylides were separated and dried before used in the next step. Monosubstituted cycloimmonium ylides generated in basic media react with aromatic isocyanates and isothiocyanates in dimethylformamide, affording the 1-disubstituted 4-(4’-pyridyl)pyridinium methylides L1 − L6 in good yields (Scheme 1 ) [22]. These products were fully characterized by spectral (IR, 1H- and 13C-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, and Mass Spectrometry) and analytical methods [22]. Their structures (including the nature of substituents) are given, together with the corresponding melting points, in Table 1 . As-synthesized compounds were obtained as polycrystalline powders and exhibited good stability of the chemical structure under normal ambient atmosphere, as resulted from the elemental analyses [22].
2.2 Sample preparation. Electric conductivity measurements The d.c. electric conductivity of as-synthesized compounds was investigated using thin-film samples (surface-type cells [14]) as thin films deposited by sol-gel (spin-coating) [31,32] technique, at room temperature, onto glass substrates. Dimethylformamide was used as solvent (in which as-synthesized compounds L1 − L6 showed good stability). By adjusting the deposition conditions (solution concentration in the range of 2–10mg/ml, rotation speed by 1500rot./min, 5 − 8 coating–drying cycles, respectively, substrate maintained at room temperature, etc), organic films of a constant thickness on large areas of their substrate surface were obtained. Thin Ag films (about 1μm thick) were thermally evaporated in vacuum (~1.33×10 3 Pa) onto substrates prior to film deposition, serving as electrodes; they were separated by a gap of 2–5mm. The ohmicity of the electrode/organic film contacts was verified. Besides, in all performed measurements low-intensity electric fields (below 102 V·cm 1) were applied, in order to prevent apparition of non-ohmic effects. The film thickness (d) was determined by using the Fizeau's method for fringes of equal thickness [33], with an interferometric microscope MII-4 (LOMO, St. Petersburg) and was found in the range of 0.10 − 0.80μm. The surface morphology of organic films was examined by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), with a NT-MDT SOLVER PRO-M equipment. The crystalline structure of the organic films was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique (CuK α radiation, λ=1.54182Ǻ), with a DRON-2.0 diffractometer. The electric conductivity type of the organic thin films was determined by using thermal-sonde method [34,35] and was found to be of n-type, for all investigated samples. The experimental arrangements used to study the temperature dependences of the electric conductivity were similar to those presented in Ref. [14]. A KEITHLEY Model 6517B electrometer was used for resistance measurements of thin-film samples.

Sample Preparation. Electric Conductivity Measurements:
The d.c. electric conductivity of as-synthesized compounds was investigated using thin-film samples (surface-type cells [14]) as thin films deposited by sol-gel (spin-coating) [31,32] technique, at room temperature, onto glass substrates. Dimethylformamide was used as solvent (in which as-synthesized compounds L1 − L6 showed good stability). By adjusting the deposition conditions (solution concentration in the range of 2–10mg/ml, rotation speed by 1500rot./min, 5 − 8 coating–drying cycles, respectively, substrate maintained at room temperature, etc), organic films of a constant thickness on large areas of their substrate surface were obtained.

The experimental arrangements used to study the temperature dependences of the electric conductivity were similar to those presented in Ref. [14]. A KEITHLEY Model 6517B electrometer was used for resistance measurements of thin-film samples.

Results And Discussion:
It is well known [3,4] that electronic transport mechanisms in organic semiconducting thin films strongly depend on their structural characteristics. The examined organic compounds in thin films display a prevailing polycrystalline structure, as revealed by the XRD study (Fig. 1 ). Structural investigations showed that sample structure depends on the compound nature (molecular structure), film thickness (increased film thickness generally resulting in larger grain sizes), as well as deposition conditions.
The XRD patterns indicate that the samples have a polycrystalline predominant structure. For films having lower thickness, the crystallites are preferentially oriented with 2 − 3 planes parallel to the substrate surface. For some of the studied films, the XRD patterns also display a halo, which indicates the presence of an amorphous phase.
By using the Bragg's law [36] (1) 2 d hkl sin θ=nλ , where θ is the Bragg angle, λ=1.54182Å is the wavelength of the incident X-ray beam, and n is the reflection order, the interplanar spacings, dhkl , have been calculated. h, k, and l denote Miller indices, used to express crystal lattice planes and directions (all parallel and equidistant planes have the same Miller indices). For peaks located in the range 2θ=14 − 30°, the interplanar spacings were found between 3.0 and 5.5Å.
The average crystallite size, D, was determined by using the Debye–Scherrer equation [36] (2) D=kλ β cos θ , where k=0.9 [36] is the Scherrer constant (crystallite shape factor) and β denotes the angular full-width at half-maximum of the XRD peak in radians. Some typical values found for as determined crystallite dimensions are presented in Table 2 .
As can be observed from Table 2, the crystallite size of the examined organic films is ranged between 19.46 and 33.38nm. The samples with larger crystallites exhibit higher electric conductivity (compounds L3 and L6, Table 3 ). A similar behavior was reported for many semiconducting materials, in thin films [37,38].
The predominantly polycrystalline structure of the examined films is expected to exert a strong influence on the electron transfer mechanisms in respective samples. In particular, additional scattering (with respect to bulk materials) by film surfaces and small crystallite boundaries, which represents the predominant scattering mechanism in the case of polycrystalline thin-film samples, leads to diminished values of the carrier mobilities and d.c. electric conduction, with respect to those of the bulk materials [37,38].
The AFM inspection of organic samples indicated (Fig. 2 ) a prevailing grain-like surface morphology, as characteristic topographical feature. The examined organic films exhibit a typical polycrystalline, compact and pinhole-free microstructure; they mainly consist of grains of different shapes and sizes, with the basis laying on the film surface. As resulted from the analysis of AFM micrographs for different organic samples, the mean values of the root mean square (RMS) roughness laid in the range of 5.4 − 69.5nm, while the mean grain sizes (in-plane projection) ranged between 59 and 156nm.
In our previous works [16,18–21], we have studied the electron transport properties of many classes of synthesized heterocyclic compounds (in polycrystalline thin films) with similar molecular structures and we found that these materials possess interesting semiconducting properties. We have experimentally established that organic thin films with stable solid-state structure can be obtained if they are submitted to a heat treatment consisting of several successive heating/cooling cycles within a certain temperature interval, ΔT, which is a characteristic for each compound (Table 3). The thermal stability of the compounds under study within respective annealing ranges was checked.
The analysis of the temperature dependence of the d.c. electric conductivity for organic films with different thickness may provide valuable information on the processes taking place during the heat treatment [16,18–21]. The electric conductivity of all studied samples was found to increase together with increasing temperature over the whole range investigated. For a large number of organic compounds with similar molecular structures, we found that an exponential temperature (T) dependence of the electric conductivity (σ) is valid, according to the well-known law [35,39–42] (3) σ=σ 0 exp − E a k B T , where Ea denotes the thermal activation energy of electric conduction, σ 0 represents a characteristic parameter depending on the compound nature and kB is the Boltzmann's constant. In the framework of the band model representation, in the intrinsic conduction domain (for T > Tc , where Tc is a characteristic temperature, given in Table 3), the thermal activation energy is equal to half of the forbidden bandwidth of the material, Eg (Ea=Eg /2), which coincides with the energy difference between conduction band (CB) minimum and the valence band (VB) top. Besides, within the extrinsic conduction domain (T < Tc ), it indicates the energy of donor levels measured with respect to the bottom of CB, or that of the acceptor levels with respect to the VB maximum, respectively [39–42].
According to Eq. (3), the lnσ=f(103/T) plots must be linear, under the assumption that the preexponential factor is temperature-independent. We supposed that for the actual organic films an exponential temperature dependence of d.c. electric conductivity is possible and the exponential law (3) also holds. Consequently, we have examined the shape of the lnσ=f(103/T) dependences during the heat treatment. The registered experimental curves were found to depend on the compound nature, thin-film thickness, and preparation conditions for organic samples. However, some similar behavior of the conductivity–temperature dependences during the heat treatment was found for all investigated samples.
Figs. 3 and 4 show typical experimental lnσ=f(103/T) curves during the heat treatment for two investigated samples of different compounds. The respective films were subjected to three successive heating/cooling cycles. Especially, during the first heating run, certain modifications in thin-film sample microstructure (grain size and shape, characteristics of intergrain boundaries, etc.) and purity (by removal of the adsorbed/absorbed gases, as well as of some impurities accidentally introduced during chemical synthesis and thin-film deposition) [20,21] may occur.
We have experimentally established that, after 2 − 3 series of successive heating/cooling runs, the film structure becomes stable and the temperature dependences of electric conductivity become reversible. This behavior indicates stabilization of thin-film solid-state structure within the investigated temperature range, ΔT [14,21].
As can be ascertain from Figs. 3–5 , the obtained lnσ=f(103/T) curves of heat treated samples are typical for the wide band gap semiconductors. They generally exhibit a portion with a smaller slope, within the lower temperature region (T < Tc ), and a portion with a larger slope in the higher temperature domain (T > Tc ). The two different slopes indicate different activation energies and different d.c. conduction mechanisms of the organic films in respective temperature ranges.
In the lower temperature region the organic films provide a prevailing extrinsic conductivity. For this temperature range, the slope of the lnσ=f(103/T) curves corresponds to the energy of the donor levels, measured with respect to the CB minimum (because actual organic films exhibit a predominant n-type conduction).
In the higher temperature range, an intrinsic conduction mechanism is present in the organic films under study. It can be observed that the intrinsic conduction domain begins at a certain temperature (Tc ), listed in Table 2, which is a characteristic for every sample. Its values were found to depend on the compound nature and organic film thickness. During the heat treatment, Tc values were observed to display a shift to lower temperature range; this behavior indicates a decrease in the impurity and structural defect concentration in actual organic films [14].
As can be inferred from Figs. 3 and 4, the slopes of the d.c. conductivity–temperature dependences, in T > Tc range, do not modify significantly during the heat treatment. This fact confirms that in the respective temperature intervals an intrinsic conduction mechanism operates. Consequently, we have determined the values of the activation energy (Ea ) for the examined organic films from the slope of the experimental lnσ=f(103/T) curves within the intrinsic conduction region, according to Eq. (2) and listed them in Table 3. For this temperature range, the thermal activation energy of the electric conduction approaches Eg /2, where Eg is the energy band gap of the bulk material of respective film [43]. The temperature dependence of d.c. electric conductivity (Figs. 3–5) suggests that in the higher temperature range (T > Tc ) the band model representation could be used for the study of the electron transport mechanism in actual organic samples.
As can be inferred from the analysis of the d.c. electric conductivity data, the examined organic compounds exhibit a typical n-type semiconductor-like behavior, which is determined by the thin-film structure, as well as specific molecular configuration (which affords extended electron conjugation). The studied organic compounds contain electron systems that are very sensitive with respect to the excitation and addition/removal of charge carriers by transport processes. They are typically characterized by the presence of π-electrons (due to aromatic group), the wavefunctions of which are highly delocalized along the molecular backbone. Generally, a larger number of π-electrons are responsible for a decrease in the activation energy and an increase in the dark d.c. electric conductivity [14].
The examined organic semiconductor materials display extended conjugation systems, which facilitate the electron transfer and serve to the enhancement of the intramolecular electric conduction. The degree of conjugation can be significantly modified by the nature and position of the substituents (R, R′) within the organic molecule, which affects the obtained values of the activation energy. These values are smaller for extended conjugation systems (Table 3).
Actual compounds display higher electric conductivity and lower activation energy compared to other organic compounds with similar structures [39,40].
The stability of the compounds is also reflected in the values of the melting points (Table 1). As can be seen, the compounds L4 − L6 having amide groups as substituents, show higher melting points than compounds L1 − L3, having thioamide groups as substituents. The same two groups of compounds (L4 − L6 and L1 − L3) can be observed in the hierarchy of the activation energies of d.c. electric conduction, compounds L4 − L6 having lower activation energies than compounds L1 − L3. This is in agreement with the electron withdrawing effect of the CO and CS groups, where the thioamide one, having a more electropositive sulfur atom (than oxygen), has a lower withdrawing effect and implicitly the conjugation will be lower than in compounds having amide groups.
On the series L1 − L3, having thioamide groups, compound L2 shows the lowest activation energy of the electric conduction, suggesting that a better resonance donating substituent R (as methoxy group is) increases the electron delocalization on the molecule and consequently, confers a better electric conductivity.
On the series L4 − L6, having amide groups, the delocalization of the ylidic negative charge on the C O amide group becomes more significant than in L1 − L3 series, therefore, a resonance withdrawing substituent at N-amide atom [as C6H4NO2(p) group is in compound L4], makes possible a delocalization of nitrogen loan pair electrons on the substituent R′.
On the other hand, these ylides are stabilized via an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the amide NH and ketone oxygen [22]. These hydrogen bonds are as well favored in compounds possessing resonance donating R substituents and resonance withdrawing R′ substituents.
A large number of models, proposed to explain the electric conduction mechanisms in organic semiconducting films, consider the presence of a higher concentration of trapping states at the crystallite boundaries, able to capture the free carriers. In these conditions, a space charge occurs at crystallite boundary and the potential barriers to the electronic transport consequently result. These barriers determine a decrease in the electric conductivity of samples.
It was experimentally established that lnσ=f(103/T) curves for actual compounds show a part with smaller slope, within the lower temperature range (T < Tc ), where the extrinsic conduction prevails. The corresponding values of the activation energies, ranging between 0.37 and 0.41eV, are too large to apply as mentioned, grain barrier limited transport models.
Thus, in the Seto's model [44] with several modifications, proposed by Baccarani, Ricco and Spandini [45], the energy barrier height can be calculated from the expression (4) E B=e 2 D m 2 N I 8 ε where Dm is the crystallite size, NI denotes the impurity concentration, and e is the electron charge; ε=ε 0·εr is the permittivity of the crystallites (ε 0 denotes the vacuum permittivity and εr —relative permittivity of the organic compounds). By considering in Eq. (4) EB=0.35eV, εr=6, Dm=30nm, one obtains NI ≅1×1018 cm−3, which is obviously an unrealistic value. For this reason, we consider that crystallite boundary trapping models are not applicable, instead the hopping conduction mechanism is more appropriate (in lower temperature range) with respect to the structural characteristics of the examined samples.
Thus, we assumed that in the lower temperature range (T < Tc ), the Mott's variable-range hopping (VRH) model [46,47] may be used to adequately explain the temperature-dependent electric conductivity of the investigated organic films. According to the VRH model, for three-dimensional systems, the conductivity–temperature dependence is given by [46,47] (5) σ=σ 0 ⋅ exp − T 0 / T 1 / 4 , where (6) σ 0=e 2 R 2 ν 0 N E F , is a pre-exponential factor and R is the hopping distance, expressed as (7) R 2=9 / 8 πα k B N E F 1 / 4 T 1 / 2 .
Parameter T 0 is a characteristic Mott temperature, characterizing the degree of disorder [47]: (8) T 0=λ α 3 k B N E F .
In the above relationships N(EF ) denotes the density of the localized states at the Fermi level EF , α −1 (α=107 cm−1) is the coefficient of exponential decay for a localized state wave function near Fermi level, λ represents a dimensionless constant, ν 0 is the typical phonon frequency, e is the electron charge, and kB is the Boltzmann's constant. By expressing parameter σ 0 in the form [47] (9) σ 0=σ * T − 1 / 2 , (σ* is another pre-exponential factor) the Eq. (5) may be written as (10) σ=σ * T − 1 / 2 ⋅ exp − T 0 / T 1 / 4 , where σ* and T 0 represent the Mott's characteristic parameters.
Assuming that σ 0 is not temperature-dependent, in virtue of Eq. (5) the ln(σ·T 1/2)=f(T −1/4) curves must be linear. For the actual organic compounds, these dependences, in the lower temperature range, 301K< T < Tc , are presented in Fig. 5.
It can be observed that as obtained experimental dependences are linear, which indicates the validity of the VRH model in suitable explaining the temperature dependence of d.c. electric conductivity of examined organic compounds in thin films, in the lower temperature range. By using data from Fig. 6 in Eq (10), the values of the Mott's parameters σ* and T 0 have been calculated and listed in Table 4 .
Suitability of investigated compounds for potential thermistor applications was also checked. The working of a thermistor is based on the temperature dependence of the electric resistance of a semiconductor material in the intrinsic conduction regime that can be described by [39] (11) R T=R ∞ ⋅ exp B T , where RT is the electric resistance at temperature T, R∞ represents a parameter depending on the compound nature, and B characterizes the temperature sensitivity of the thermistor.The temperature coefficient of the resistance, defined by [39] (12) α T=1 R dR dT can be expressed as a function of temperature, by means of Eq. (11): (13) α T=− B T 2 .
The obtained values of the characteristic parameters αT (at temperature T=435K) and B are listed in Table 5 for the studied organic films. It can be concluded that some of the examined compounds could be suitable for thermistor applications.

Conclusions:
The recently synthesized organic compounds, stable disubstituted 4-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium ylides (L compounds) in thin films behave as typical n-type polycrystalline semiconductors.
The electron transfer in the investigated compounds is strongly influenced by their specific molecular structures, enabling formation of extended conjugation systems, as well as their packing capacity.
In the higher temperature range (T > Tc ), the d.c. electric conductivity of actual compounds can be described in terms of the band gap representation model. In the lower temperature region (301K< T < Tc ) the Mott's variable-range hopping model can be conveniently used.

In our previous papers [14–21] we studied the electronic transport and optical properties for a great number of organic compounds, for which a typical semiconducting behavior was found. In this paper, we extend these investigations to some recently synthesized organic compounds, stable disubstituted 4-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium ylides [22], in form of polycrystalline thin films. Disubstituted cycloimmonium ylides have a great potential for use as analytical reagents or semiconducting materials [15,23,24] and some of them have been shown to display biological activity [25,26]. Cycloimmonium ylides are also used in the synthesis of ylidic polymers having specific properties [27].

Pyridinium ylides under study derived from 4,4’-bipyridine were synthesized using in the first step, the salt method of Kröhnke [28]. Thus, the monobromides S1 − S4 [29,30] were dissolved in water and treated with aqueous 0.2N NaOH solution. The obtained suspension was centrifuged and the monosubstituted ylides were separated and dried before used in the next step. Monosubstituted cycloimmonium ylides generated in basic media react with aromatic isocyanates and isothiocyanates in dimethylformamide, affording the 1-disubstituted 4-(4’-pyridyl)pyridinium methylides L1 − L6 in good yields (Scheme 1 ) [22].

These products were fully characterized by spectral (IR, 1H- and 13C-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, and Mass Spectrometry) and analytical methods [22]. Their structures (including the nature of substituents) are given, together with the corresponding melting points, in Table 1 . As-synthesized compounds were obtained as polycrystalline powders and exhibited good stability of the chemical structure under normal ambient atmosphere, as resulted from the elemental analyses [22].

The d.c. electric conductivity of as-synthesized compounds was investigated using thin-film samples (surface-type cells [14]) as thin films deposited by sol-gel (spin-coating) [31,32] technique, at room temperature, onto glass substrates. Dimethylformamide was used as solvent (in which as-synthesized compounds L1 − L6 showed good stability). By adjusting the deposition conditions (solution concentration in the range of 2–10mg/ml, rotation speed by 1500rot./min, 5 − 8 coating–drying cycles, respectively, substrate maintained at room temperature, etc), organic films of a constant thickness on large areas of their substrate surface were obtained.

Thin Ag films (about 1μm thick) were thermally evaporated in vacuum (~1.33×10 3 Pa) onto substrates prior to film deposition, serving as electrodes; they were separated by a gap of 2–5mm. The ohmicity of the electrode/organic film contacts was verified. Besides, in all performed measurements low-intensity electric fields (below 102 V·cm 1) were applied, in order to prevent apparition of non-ohmic effects.

The film thickness (d) was determined by using the Fizeau's method for fringes of equal thickness [33], with an interferometric microscope MII-4 (LOMO, St. Petersburg) and was found in the range of 0.10 − 0.80μm. The surface morphology of organic films was examined by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), with a NT-MDT SOLVER PRO-M equipment. The crystalline structure of the organic films was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique (CuK α radiation, λ=1.54182Ǻ), with a DRON-2.0 diffractometer.

The electric conductivity type of the organic thin films was determined by using thermal-sonde method [34,35] and was found to be of n-type, for all investigated samples. The experimental arrangements used to study the temperature dependences of the electric conductivity were similar to those presented in Ref. [14]. A KEITHLEY Model 6517B electrometer was used for resistance measurements of thin-film samples.

It is well known [3,4] that electronic transport mechanisms in organic semiconducting thin films strongly depend on their structural characteristics. The examined organic compounds in thin films display a prevailing polycrystalline structure, as revealed by the XRD study (Fig. 1 ). Structural investigations showed that sample structure depends on the compound nature (molecular structure), film thickness (increased film thickness generally resulting in larger grain sizes), as well as deposition conditions.

The XRD patterns indicate that the samples have a polycrystalline predominant structure. For films having lower thickness, the crystallites are preferentially oriented with 2 − 3 planes parallel to the substrate surface. For some of the studied films, the XRD patterns also display a halo, which indicates the presence of an amorphous phase.

By using the Bragg's law [36] (1) 2 d hkl sin θ=nλ , where θ is the Bragg angle, λ=1.54182Å is the wavelength of the incident X-ray beam, and n is the reflection order, the interplanar spacings, dhkl , have been calculated. h, k, and l denote Miller indices, used to express crystal lattice planes and directions (all parallel and equidistant planes have the same Miller indices). For peaks located in the range 2θ=14 − 30°, the interplanar spacings were found between 3.0 and 5.5Å.

The average crystallite size, D, was determined by using the Debye–Scherrer equation [36] (2) D=kλ β cos θ , where k=0.9 [36] is the Scherrer constant (crystallite shape factor) and β denotes the angular full-width at half-maximum of the XRD peak in radians. Some typical values found for as determined crystallite dimensions are presented in Table 2 .

As can be observed from Table 2, the crystallite size of the examined organic films is ranged between 19.46 and 33.38nm. The samples with larger crystallites exhibit higher electric conductivity (compounds L3 and L6, Table 3 ). A similar behavior was reported for many semiconducting materials, in thin films [37,38].

The predominantly polycrystalline structure of the examined films is expected to exert a strong influence on the electron transfer mechanisms in respective samples. In particular, additional scattering (with respect to bulk materials) by film surfaces and small crystallite boundaries, which represents the predominant scattering mechanism in the case of polycrystalline thin-film samples, leads to diminished values of the carrier mobilities and d.c. electric conduction, with respect to those of the bulk materials [37,38].

The AFM inspection of organic samples indicated (Fig. 2 ) a prevailing grain-like surface morphology, as characteristic topographical feature. The examined organic films exhibit a typical polycrystalline, compact and pinhole-free microstructure; they mainly consist of grains of different shapes and sizes, with the basis laying on the film surface. As resulted from the analysis of AFM micrographs for different organic samples, the mean values of the root mean square (RMS) roughness laid in the range of 5.4 − 69.5nm, while the mean grain sizes (in-plane projection) ranged between 59 and 156nm.

In our previous works [16,18–21], we have studied the electron transport properties of many classes of synthesized heterocyclic compounds (in polycrystalline thin films) with similar molecular structures and we found that these materials possess interesting semiconducting properties. We have experimentally established that organic thin films with stable solid-state structure can be obtained if they are submitted to a heat treatment consisting of several successive heating/cooling cycles within a certain temperature interval, ΔT, which is a characteristic for each compound (Table 3). The thermal stability of the compounds under study within respective annealing ranges was checked.

The analysis of the temperature dependence of the d.c. electric conductivity for organic films with different thickness may provide valuable information on the processes taking place during the heat treatment [16,18–21]. The electric conductivity of all studied samples was found to increase together with increasing temperature over the whole range investigated. For a large number of organic compounds with similar molecular structures, we found that an exponential temperature (T) dependence of the electric conductivity (σ) is valid, according to the well-known law [35,39–42] (3) σ=σ 0 exp − E a k B T , where Ea denotes the thermal activation energy of electric conduction, σ 0 represents a characteristic parameter depending on the compound nature and kB is the Boltzmann's constant. In the framework of the band model representation, in the intrinsic conduction domain (for T > Tc , where Tc is a characteristic temperature, given in Table 3), the thermal activation energy is equal to half of the forbidden bandwidth of the material, Eg (Ea=Eg /2), which coincides with the energy difference between conduction band (CB) minimum and the valence band (VB) top. Besides, within the extrinsic conduction domain (T < Tc ), it indicates the energy of donor levels measured with respect to the bottom of CB, or that of the acceptor levels with respect to the VB maximum, respectively [39–42].

According to Eq. (3), the lnσ=f(103/T) plots must be linear, under the assumption that the preexponential factor is temperature-independent. We supposed that for the actual organic films an exponential temperature dependence of d.c. electric conductivity is possible and the exponential law (3) also holds. Consequently, we have examined the shape of the lnσ=f(103/T) dependences during the heat treatment. The registered experimental curves were found to depend on the compound nature, thin-film thickness, and preparation conditions for organic samples. However, some similar behavior of the conductivity–temperature dependences during the heat treatment was found for all investigated samples.

Figs. 3 and 4 show typical experimental lnσ=f(103/T) curves during the heat treatment for two investigated samples of different compounds. The respective films were subjected to three successive heating/cooling cycles. Especially, during the first heating run, certain modifications in thin-film sample microstructure (grain size and shape, characteristics of intergrain boundaries, etc.) and purity (by removal of the adsorbed/absorbed gases, as well as of some impurities accidentally introduced during chemical synthesis and thin-film deposition) [20,21] may occur.

We have experimentally established that, after 2 − 3 series of successive heating/cooling runs, the film structure becomes stable and the temperature dependences of electric conductivity become reversible. This behavior indicates stabilization of thin-film solid-state structure within the investigated temperature range, ΔT [14,21].

As can be ascertain from Figs. 3–5 , the obtained lnσ=f(103/T) curves of heat treated samples are typical for the wide band gap semiconductors. They generally exhibit a portion with a smaller slope, within the lower temperature region (T < Tc ), and a portion with a larger slope in the higher temperature domain (T > Tc ). The two different slopes indicate different activation energies and different d.c. conduction mechanisms of the organic films in respective temperature ranges.

In the lower temperature region the organic films provide a prevailing extrinsic conductivity. For this temperature range, the slope of the lnσ=f(103/T) curves corresponds to the energy of the donor levels, measured with respect to the CB minimum (because actual organic films exhibit a predominant n-type conduction).

In the higher temperature range, an intrinsic conduction mechanism is present in the organic films under study. It can be observed that the intrinsic conduction domain begins at a certain temperature (Tc ), listed in Table 2, which is a characteristic for every sample. Its values were found to depend on the compound nature and organic film thickness. During the heat treatment, Tc values were observed to display a shift to lower temperature range; this behavior indicates a decrease in the impurity and structural defect concentration in actual organic films [14].

As can be inferred from Figs. 3 and 4, the slopes of the d.c. conductivity–temperature dependences, in T > Tc range, do not modify significantly during the heat treatment. This fact confirms that in the respective temperature intervals an intrinsic conduction mechanism operates. Consequently, we have determined the values of the activation energy (Ea ) for the examined organic films from the slope of the experimental lnσ=f(103/T) curves within the intrinsic conduction region, according to Eq. (2) and listed them in Table 3. For this temperature range, the thermal activation energy of the electric conduction approaches Eg /2, where Eg is the energy band gap of the bulk material of respective film [43]. The temperature dependence of d.c. electric conductivity (Figs. 3–5) suggests that in the higher temperature range (T > Tc ) the band model representation could be used for the study of the electron transport mechanism in actual organic samples.

As can be inferred from the analysis of the d.c. electric conductivity data, the examined organic compounds exhibit a typical n-type semiconductor-like behavior, which is determined by the thin-film structure, as well as specific molecular configuration (which affords extended electron conjugation). The studied organic compounds contain electron systems that are very sensitive with respect to the excitation and addition/removal of charge carriers by transport processes. They are typically characterized by the presence of π-electrons (due to aromatic group), the wavefunctions of which are highly delocalized along the molecular backbone. Generally, a larger number of π-electrons are responsible for a decrease in the activation energy and an increase in the dark d.c. electric conductivity [14].

The examined organic semiconductor materials display extended conjugation systems, which facilitate the electron transfer and serve to the enhancement of the intramolecular electric conduction. The degree of conjugation can be significantly modified by the nature and position of the substituents (R, R′) within the organic molecule, which affects the obtained values of the activation energy. These values are smaller for extended conjugation systems (Table 3).

Actual compounds display higher electric conductivity and lower activation energy compared to other organic compounds with similar structures [39,40].

The stability of the compounds is also reflected in the values of the melting points (Table 1). As can be seen, the compounds L4 − L6 having amide groups as substituents, show higher melting points than compounds L1 − L3, having thioamide groups as substituents. The same two groups of compounds (L4 − L6 and L1 − L3) can be observed in the hierarchy of the activation energies of d.c. electric conduction, compounds L4 − L6 having lower activation energies than compounds L1 − L3. This is in agreement with the electron withdrawing effect of the CO and CS groups, where the thioamide one, having a more electropositive sulfur atom (than oxygen), has a lower withdrawing effect and implicitly the conjugation will be lower than in compounds having amide groups.

On the series L1 − L3, having thioamide groups, compound L2 shows the lowest activation energy of the electric conduction, suggesting that a better resonance donating substituent R (as methoxy group is) increases the electron delocalization on the molecule and consequently, confers a better electric conductivity.

On the series L4 − L6, having amide groups, the delocalization of the ylidic negative charge on the C O amide group becomes more significant than in L1 − L3 series, therefore, a resonance withdrawing substituent at N-amide atom [as C6H4NO2(p) group is in compound L4], makes possible a delocalization of nitrogen loan pair electrons on the substituent R′.

On the other hand, these ylides are stabilized via an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the amide NH and ketone oxygen [22]. These hydrogen bonds are as well favored in compounds possessing resonance donating R substituents and resonance withdrawing R′ substituents.

A large number of models, proposed to explain the electric conduction mechanisms in organic semiconducting films, consider the presence of a higher concentration of trapping states at the crystallite boundaries, able to capture the free carriers. In these conditions, a space charge occurs at crystallite boundary and the potential barriers to the electronic transport consequently result. These barriers determine a decrease in the electric conductivity of samples.

It was experimentally established that lnσ=f(103/T) curves for actual compounds show a part with smaller slope, within the lower temperature range (T < Tc ), where the extrinsic conduction prevails. The corresponding values of the activation energies, ranging between 0.37 and 0.41eV, are too large to apply as mentioned, grain barrier limited transport models.

Thus, in the Seto's model [44] with several modifications, proposed by Baccarani, Ricco and Spandini [45], the energy barrier height can be calculated from the expression (4) E B=e 2 D m 2 N I 8 ε where Dm is the crystallite size, NI denotes the impurity concentration, and e is the electron charge; ε=ε 0·εr is the permittivity of the crystallites (ε 0 denotes the vacuum permittivity and εr —relative permittivity of the organic compounds). By considering in Eq. (4) EB=0.35eV, εr=6, Dm=30nm, one obtains NI ≅1×1018 cm−3, which is obviously an unrealistic value. For this reason, we consider that crystallite boundary trapping models are not applicable, instead the hopping conduction mechanism is more appropriate (in lower temperature range) with respect to the structural characteristics of the examined samples.

Thus, we assumed that in the lower temperature range (T < Tc ), the Mott's variable-range hopping (VRH) model [46,47] may be used to adequately explain the temperature-dependent electric conductivity of the investigated organic films. According to the VRH model, for three-dimensional systems, the conductivity–temperature dependence is given by [46,47] (5) σ=σ 0 ⋅ exp − T 0 / T 1 / 4 , where (6) σ 0=e 2 R 2 ν 0 N E F , is a pre-exponential factor and R is the hopping distance, expressed as (7) R 2=9 / 8 πα k B N E F 1 / 4 T 1 / 2 .

Parameter T 0 is a characteristic Mott temperature, characterizing the degree of disorder [47]: (8) T 0=λ α 3 k B N E F .

In the above relationships N(EF ) denotes the density of the localized states at the Fermi level EF , α −1 (α=107 cm−1) is the coefficient of exponential decay for a localized state wave function near Fermi level, λ represents a dimensionless constant, ν 0 is the typical phonon frequency, e is the electron charge, and kB is the Boltzmann's constant. By expressing parameter σ 0 in the form [47] (9) σ 0=σ * T − 1 / 2 , (σ* is another pre-exponential factor) the Eq. (5) may be written as (10) σ=σ * T − 1 / 2 ⋅ exp − T 0 / T 1 / 4 , where σ* and T 0 represent the Mott's characteristic parameters.

Assuming that σ 0 is not temperature-dependent, in virtue of Eq. (5) the ln(σ·T 1/2)=f(T −1/4) curves must be linear. For the actual organic compounds, these dependences, in the lower temperature range, 301K< T < Tc , are presented in Fig. 5.

It can be observed that as obtained experimental dependences are linear, which indicates the validity of the VRH model in suitable explaining the temperature dependence of d.c. electric conductivity of examined organic compounds in thin films, in the lower temperature range. By using data from Fig. 6 in Eq (10), the values of the Mott's parameters σ* and T 0 have been calculated and listed in Table 4 .

Suitability of investigated compounds for potential thermistor applications was also checked. The working of a thermistor is based on the temperature dependence of the electric resistance of a semiconductor material in the intrinsic conduction regime that can be described by [39] (11) R T=R ∞ ⋅ exp B T , where RT is the electric resistance at temperature T, R∞ represents a parameter depending on the compound nature, and B characterizes the temperature sensitivity of the thermistor.The temperature coefficient of the resistance, defined by [39] (12) α T=1 R dR dT can be expressed as a function of temperature, by means of Eq. (11): (13) α T=− B T 2 .

The obtained values of the characteristic parameters αT (at temperature T=435K) and B are listed in Table 5 for the studied organic films. It can be concluded that some of the examined compounds could be suitable for thermistor applications.

The recently synthesized organic compounds, stable disubstituted 4-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium ylides (L compounds) in thin films behave as typical n-type polycrystalline semiconductors.

The electron transfer in the investigated compounds is strongly influenced by their specific molecular structures, enabling formation of extended conjugation systems, as well as their packing capacity.

In the higher temperature range (T > Tc ), the d.c. electric conductivity of actual compounds can be described in terms of the band gap representation model. In the lower temperature region (301K< T < Tc ) the Mott's variable-range hopping model can be conveniently used.

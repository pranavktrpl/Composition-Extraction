Abstract:
Transparent Nd:YAG nanoceramics composed of nanosized grains were fabricated by high-pressure low temperature sintering technique (HPLT). Structural and morphological studies of the sintered pellets were carried out using X-ray powder diffraction and Transmission Electron Microscopy. The hardness of nanoceramics, extinction coefficient and transmittance spectra were measured and analyzed. The initial grain size of the YAG powder was 30nm and no grain growth has taken place during the consolidation process. The density of the obtained nanoceramics was close to the theoretical density of YAG.

Introduction:
In the last decade, there is a great interest in obtaining transparent ceramics of Y3Al5O12 (Ytrium Aluminium Garnet, YAG). It was shown recently, that sintering of nanocrystalline YAG powders [1–4] is a competitive technology comparing to the traditional technology of YAG single crystals growth [5]. The excellent optical properties of Nd3+:YAG laser ceramics were reported in details by several authors [4,6]. Therefore, there is also a considerable interest in synthesis and optical properties of rare-earth doped YAG nanocrystallites. YAG nanopowders may be synthesized by several methods including sol–gel [7], Pechini [8], solvothermal [9], combustion [10] and co-precipitation [11]. For preparation of high optical quality ceramics both structurally pure and non-aggregated nanopowders are required. However, less work has been done to sinter nanocrystalline ceramics [12–24].
Dense ceramics with nano grain size may display new structural, magnetic, electric or electronic properties with great potential for applications. However, sintering usually causes grain growth to micrometer range. There are three main methods to prevent grain growth during sintering [12]: application of hot-pressing or sintering forging, addition of dopant to modify diffusion process, and sintering powders in metastable crystallographic phases that during sintering act as seeds for the final phases. The third one is used for such materials like TiO2 and Al2O3 [13,14]. For example nanoscale glass-ceramic alumina doped by rare-earth oxides (Nd2O3, Eu2O3, Er2O3) with transparency in the mid-infrared range can be achieved by heating for a short time bulk glasses [15]. Also non-conventional sintering methods like microwave sintering [16,17], shock or dynamic consolidation [18,19], field assisted sintering [20,21], high pressure low temperature sintering [22–24] are applied.
The YAG ceramics described in [1–4] have a grain size in the range of micrometers. In the present work, the preparation and properties of Nd:Y3Al5O12 nanoceramics are described. They were obtained from Nd:YAG nanocrystallites using the high pressure low temperature (HPLT) technique.

Experimental:
YAG powder used as the starting material for nanoceramic fabrication was prepared by a modified sol–gel method similar to that used by Pechini and described by us elsewhere [25]. Briefly, aqueous nitrate solutions of Y3+ and Nd3+ ions were prepared by dissolving high-purity Y2O3 (99.99%) and Nd2O3 (99.99%) in HNO3 in such proportion to obtain 1mol% of Nd. Stoichiometric amounts of yttrium nitrate and aluminium chloride (99.999%) were dissolved in aqueous citric acid solution end ethylene glycol (99%) to give a 3:5:10:4 molar ratio appropriately. The solution was hold at the temperature of 90°C until the resin was formed. The obtained in such a way brown sample was calcinated at 900°C in air for 16h.
X-ray diffraction patterns were collected in 2θ range of 10–120° at room temperature, with a step of 0.02° using a X-ray (CuKα) diffractometer (Model D5000 Siemens). The grain size of the powders was estimated by Scherrer method, Williamson–Hall method and newly developed XRD peak fine profile analysis [26,27] which permits to fit the peaks using an analytical function with fitting parameters:<R>average particle diameter and dispersion of grain sizes σ. The average grain size of the powder used as a starting material was also determined from surface area. The specific surface area analysis was conducted by means of the multipoint BET method (apparatus Gemini 2360, Micromeritics Instruments), using nitrogen as an adsorbate. Assuming a spherical shape of particle the average diameter of particle was determined using the equation: (1) d BET=6 / S BET ρ pic where d BET is average diameter of spherical particle, S BET is specific surface area and ρ density of YAG.
The density of the powders was measured by means of helium picnometry (ρ pic) (Model AccuPyc 1330, Micromeritics Instruments). The density of the nanopowders is an important parameter since it can be compared with density of single crystals and it can be concluded about the difference of phase composition of the powders and single crystals with high precision. Before sintering, pellets were formed from the powder by cold pressing in a cylindrical cell under pressure of 0.8GPa. Pellets of diameter 4mm and height about 2mm were formed in that way. The sintering process was carried out in solid-state high-pressure cell of toroid-type. A schematic representation of the high pressure cell is presented on Fig. 1 .
The pellet is located in the centre of the cell and surrounded by BN (hexagonal boron nitride). The graphite tube is a resistance heater. A ceramic made of CaCO3 is situated between two anvils and plays the role of pressure container. The force excreted by the anvils create a quasi-isostatic pressure in the range 2–8GPa, depending on the applied force. The samples of nanoceramics were prepared by hot-pressing at temperature 450°C during 1min. This pressing temperature was found by us earlier as optimal to prevent the decomposition of Y3Al5O12 into YAlO3 and Al2O3 phases [28].
The microstructure of sintered pellets and of the powders was examined by means of TEM (JEOL JEM 3010 model). The microhardness of sintered pellets was measured by Vickers method with load 200g and 15s.
The density of the sintered ceramics was measured using the Archimedes method. Sintered pellets before transmittance investigation and microhardness measurement were grinded by silicon carbide wet grinding paper (Struers grit 1200–4000) and subsequently mechanically polished on cloths with diamond suspension (Struers–DiaPro).
Transmittance spectra presented in this work were obtained by means of a Cary 5 UV–Vis–NIR (Varian) double beam spectrophotometer over the wavelength from 300 to 1200nm. The extinction coefficient was calculated from transmittance measurements of two samples of the same material with different thickness x 1 and x 2. Transmittance T can be expressed [29] as (2) T=( 1 - R ) 2 exp ( - kx ) where R is reflectance, k is the extinction coefficient and x is the sample thickness. The extinction coefficient includes not only absorption but also losses due to scattering of light at scattering centres in the sample. R is given by well known Fresnel’s formula (3) R=( n - 1 ) 2 ( n + 1 ) 2 where n is the refractive index. The reflection loss F, also called the Fresnel surface loss, which represents all losses not related to the absorption and scattering effects, is then defined as [29] (4) F=1 - ( 1 - R ) 2 The extinction coefficient k for the most transparent of the obtained nanoceramics was calculated as follows: (5) k=- ln ( T 1 / T 2 ) x 1 - x 2

Results:
3.1 Powder properties The specific surface area of Nd:YAG doped powders was 28m2/g. The average diameter of YAG particle (d BET) was determined using formula (1). The result was verified by Scherrer, Williamson–Hall method and fine analysis of diffraction profile Fig. 2 . Table 1 shows the values of grain size measured by all above methods and the density of the nanopowders. The density of nanopowders is the level of 94% of the density of YAG single crystals, which is ρ YAG=4.55g/cm3. According to our experience YAG powder indicate of high crystalline quality and phase purity of the powders. Fig. 2 shows the grain size distribution (GSD) calculated using the fine analysis of diffraction profiles method. The XRD values give a slightly smaller values for grains size than the BET method, what my indicate some agglomeration of the powders.
3.2 Nanoceramics properties The X-ray pattern of the sintered ceramics shows no other than YAG phases (Fig. 3 ). The XRD peaks are asymmetric and their width increase with 2θ, what indicate presence of microstrains. Microstrain and grain size Nd:YAG pellet calculated by Williamson-Hall method is 0.89% and 37nm appropriately (Fig. 4 ). Grain size of powder and pellet is almost the same (in the limit of experimental error). Grain size of powder is comparable with measured by other XRD techniques (Table 1). The density of pellets measured using the Archimedes method is shown in Table 2 . As it can be seen in Table 2, the pellet before sintering has about 50% of the theoretical density of YAG single crystal (ρ YAG=4.55g/cm3). The density increases significantly up to 4GPa compaction pressure, where it reaches the value of 99% of the theoretical density and above this pressure does not increase any more. The error of measurement is 8% measured by differential calculus of small changes. The transparency of the samples increases when the sintering pressure increases from 6 to 8GPa (Fig. 5 ). The transmittance of the most transparent Nd:YAG nanoceramic samples, i.e, that sintered at 450°C 8GPa for 1min, is shown in Fig. 6 . Transmittance for sample thickness x 1=0.142cm and x 2=0.116cm is shown. At wavelength 1064nm the absorption coefficients are T 1=36.9%, T 2=52.5% for x 1=0.142cm and x 2=0.116cm, respectively. According to Eq. (5) the extinction coefficient α is 13.6cm−1. The narrow peaks observed in the spectrum correspond to the absorption of Nd3+ ions and correspond to the f–f electron transition bands reported for the YAG single crystal [5,6]. The theoretical reflection loss, calculated using the refractive indices of YAG single crystal [30] are plotted in the Fig. 6 (dotted line). The microstructure of the YAG nanoceramic sintered at 8GPa, 450°C, for 1min is shown in Fig. 7 . The grain size of the crystallites according to this picture is in range 30−50nm. The white areas between the grains represent pores of thickness of a few nanometers and length comparable to the particles size. Table 3 shows a significant increase of microhardness with increase of temperature sintering.

Table 3 shows a significant increase of microhardness with increase of temperature sintering.

Discussion:
The present results indicate that ultra high pressure sintering leads to formation of dense transparent YAG ceramics with a grain size in the range of 30–40nm. Average grain size of powder and pellet are close each other (Fig. 4) so there is no significant grain growth during sintering process. The nanoceramic obtained at 8GPa sintering pressure displays transparency T ≈50% for thickness x 1=0.142cm at wavelength 1064nm, which is wavelength range for Nd excitation and emission. The extinction coefficient k includes both the absorption and scattering factors. Its value 13.6cm−1 is much larger than reported recently for ceramics of YAG with microsized grains, where the absorption coefficient is less then 2.5cm−1 and the scattering coefficient<0.1cm−1. It confirms that the porosity of the present nanoceramics contributes to scattering of light and decrease of transparency comparing to that of single crystals or microcrystalline ceramics referred to in recent papers [32,36].
In general, the scattering can depend both on pore sizes and their concentration. However, when the pores sizes are below some critical value (depending on a light wavelength) the concentration of very small nanopores should not influent on scattering. In order to explain the effect of sintering pressure on transparency, we assumed in the first step that sintering pressure can reduce pore size significantly (below scattering criteria). Braun and Pilon have explained increase of transmittancy by reduction on pores size. They assumed the model that light scattering depends only on the size of the scattering objects and not on their concentration [37]. They proposed a quantitative criterion for neglecting Rayleigh scattering based on estimation of a size parameter χ, defined as χ=π/λ, where D is the pore diameter and λ is the incident wavelength. For no Rayleigh scattering χ ≪1. Fig. 8 shows χ as a function of pore size and wavelength. We assumed that the condition for low scattering coefficient of the sample is χ <0.1. Accordingly, the pore size for negligible scattering is D <15nm for wavelength 500nm, and D <35nm for λ=1100nm, respectively. The observed in the investigated sample decrease of transmittance with decreasing wavelength (Fig. 6) can be explained therefore in terms of presence of pores larger then 10nm.
From quantitative point of view, because in reality not all pores are below scattering criteria, another way to increase transmittance of ceramic samples is to decrease the number of larger pores. As disussed by Krell et al. [33–35], ceramic alumina with transmittance comparable to that of a single crystal can be obtained for porosity below 0.05vol%.
In the present work we try to obtain high transparency by applying high pressure to decrease the size of pores below the limit where they scatter light. It is natural to assume, that the pressure needed to close the pores increases as the size of the pores decreases. A pressure above 2GPa can lead to closure of the larger pores, for instance so called interagglomerate pores formed between agglomerates of nanoparticles present in the green body, while it may have little effect on the intra-agglomerate porosity. Closing of large pores via breaking of agglomerates and creation of a material with a uniform distribution of nano-sized pores was observed by Gierlotka et al. [38] during sintering of SiC nanoceramics at pressures above 2GPa.
The observed in previous work [28] structural decomposition of YAG nanopowders does not permit to increase the temperature of sintering above a certain limit. For 8GPa this temperature is 450°C. This temperature is much lower than the typical sintering temperatures, which even for nano-powders are above 0.5 of the melting point. Nevertheless, an increase of hardness of the ceramics compared to room temperature compaction was observed with increased sintering temperature. This effect can be explained by formation of grain boundaries between the nano-sized grains due to short range diffusion. However, the observed values are still much lower then reported for YAG single crystals [31]. Since the temperature of sintering cannot be increased, further increase of microhardness can be obtained by elongation of the sintering time.
It is interesting to note that the nanoceramic displays microstrains of 0.89%, which is reflected by broadening of XRD peaks. Such microstrains can be connected with elastic deformation of the nanograins, that under extreme pressure are forced to change their shapes to fit in the space available for them between their neighbours. Such strains may also arise at contacts between grains. Let us try to assess what are the stresses within the nanosized particles. According to [39] the elastic constants of YAG are C11 close to 333GPa and C12, C14 113, 115GPa, respectively. Using a very rough estimate that stress within a nanograin is σ=C11 ε where ε is microstrain, and ε=0.89%, we obtain that σ in range of 3GPa. The shear stress components would be accordingly close to 1GPa. The material displays high mechanical strength and stability despite such high internal microstrains. This might be the result of formation of grain boundaries between grains and high friction stresses at grain contacts. Control of the strains, grain size, ant their effect on the properties of YAG nanoceramics, will be a subject of our further studies.

Conclusions:
The method of fabrication of ceramics composed of Nd:YAG nanosized grains by means of high pressure low temperature sintering technique was developed. In particular the effect of applied pressure on preparation of transparent YAG nanoceramics was studied. The optimal sintering condition for obtaining of optically transparent nanoceramics are temperature of 450°C and pressure of 8GPa. As result, a nanoporous and transparent sample with 37nm grains was obtained with extinction coefficient 13.6cm−1 for λ=1064nm. The microhardness of the nanoceramics takes values from 6.5GPa to 9.3GPa depending on the sintering conditions. There is a uniform distribution of nano-sized pores in the ceramics, which contributes to scattering of transmitted light. Further studies are needed to assess how the microstrains observed in the nanoceramics influence their optical and mechanical properties.

Body:
In the last decade, there is a great interest in obtaining transparent ceramics of Y3Al5O12 (Ytrium Aluminium Garnet, YAG). It was shown recently, that sintering of nanocrystalline YAG powders [1–4] is a competitive technology comparing to the traditional technology of YAG single crystals growth [5]. The excellent optical properties of Nd3+:YAG laser ceramics were reported in details by several authors [4,6]. Therefore, there is also a considerable interest in synthesis and optical properties of rare-earth doped YAG nanocrystallites.

For preparation of high optical quality ceramics both structurally pure and non-aggregated nanopowders are required. However, less work has been done to sinter nanocrystalline ceramics [12–24].

There are three main methods to prevent grain growth during sintering [12]: application of hot-pressing or sintering forging, addition of dopant to modify diffusion process, and sintering powders in metastable crystallographic phases that during sintering act as seeds for the final phases. The third one is used for such materials like TiO2 and Al2O3 [13,14]. For example nanoscale glass-ceramic alumina doped by rare-earth oxides (Nd2O3, Eu2O3, Er2O3) with transparency in the mid-infrared range can be achieved by heating for a short time bulk glasses [15]. Also non-conventional sintering methods like microwave sintering [16,17], shock or dynamic consolidation [18,19], field assisted sintering [20,21], high pressure low temperature sintering [22–24] are applied.

The YAG ceramics described in [1–4] have a grain size in the range of micrometers. In the present work, the preparation and properties of Nd:Y3Al5O12 nanoceramics are described. They were obtained from Nd:YAG nanocrystallites using the high pressure low temperature (HPLT) technique.

YAG powder used as the starting material for nanoceramic fabrication was prepared by a modified sol–gel method similar to that used by Pechini and described by us elsewhere [25]. Briefly, aqueous nitrate solutions of Y3+ and Nd3+ ions were prepared by dissolving high-purity Y2O3 (99.99%) and Nd2O3 (99.99%) in HNO3 in such proportion to obtain 1mol% of Nd. Stoichiometric amounts of yttrium nitrate and aluminium chloride (99.999%) were dissolved in aqueous citric acid solution end ethylene glycol (99%) to give a 3:5:10:4 molar ratio appropriately. The solution was hold at the temperature of 90°C until the resin was formed. The obtained in such a way brown sample was calcinated at 900°C in air for 16h.

X-ray diffraction patterns were collected in 2θ range of 10–120° at room temperature, with a step of 0.02° using a X-ray (CuKα) diffractometer (Model D5000 Siemens). The grain size of the powders was estimated by Scherrer method, Williamson–Hall method and newly developed XRD peak fine profile analysis [26,27] which permits to fit the peaks using an analytical function with fitting parameters:<R>average particle diameter and dispersion of grain sizes σ. The average grain size of the powder used as a starting material was also determined from surface area. The specific surface area analysis was conducted by means of the multipoint BET method (apparatus Gemini 2360, Micromeritics Instruments), using nitrogen as an adsorbate. Assuming a spherical shape of particle the average diameter of particle was determined using the equation: (1) d BET=6 / S BET ρ pic where d BET is average diameter of spherical particle, S BET is specific surface area and ρ density of YAG.

The density of the powders was measured by means of helium picnometry (ρ pic) (Model AccuPyc 1330, Micromeritics Instruments). The density of the nanopowders is an important parameter since it can be compared with density of single crystals and it can be concluded about the difference of phase composition of the powders and single crystals with high precision. Before sintering, pellets were formed from the powder by cold pressing in a cylindrical cell under pressure of 0.8GPa. Pellets of diameter 4mm and height about 2mm were formed in that way. The sintering process was carried out in solid-state high-pressure cell of toroid-type. A schematic representation of the high pressure cell is presented on Fig. 1 .

The pellet is located in the centre of the cell and surrounded by BN (hexagonal boron nitride). The graphite tube is a resistance heater. A ceramic made of CaCO3 is situated between two anvils and plays the role of pressure container. The force excreted by the anvils create a quasi-isostatic pressure in the range 2–8GPa, depending on the applied force. The samples of nanoceramics were prepared by hot-pressing at temperature 450°C during 1min. This pressing temperature was found by us earlier as optimal to prevent the decomposition of Y3Al5O12 into YAlO3 and Al2O3 phases [28].

The microstructure of sintered pellets and of the powders was examined by means of TEM (JEOL JEM 3010 model). The microhardness of sintered pellets was measured by Vickers method with load 200g and 15s.

The density of the sintered ceramics was measured using the Archimedes method. Sintered pellets before transmittance investigation and microhardness measurement were grinded by silicon carbide wet grinding paper (Struers grit 1200–4000) and subsequently mechanically polished on cloths with diamond suspension (Struers–DiaPro).

Transmittance spectra presented in this work were obtained by means of a Cary 5 UV–Vis–NIR (Varian) double beam spectrophotometer over the wavelength from 300 to 1200nm. The extinction coefficient was calculated from transmittance measurements of two samples of the same material with different thickness x 1 and x 2. Transmittance T can be expressed [29] as (2) T=( 1 - R ) 2 exp ( - kx ) where R is reflectance, k is the extinction coefficient and x is the sample thickness. The extinction coefficient includes not only absorption but also losses due to scattering of light at scattering centres in the sample. R is given by well known Fresnel’s formula (3) R=( n - 1 ) 2 ( n + 1 ) 2 where n is the refractive index. The reflection loss F, also called the Fresnel surface loss, which represents all losses not related to the absorption and scattering effects, is then defined as [29] (4) F=1 - ( 1 - R ) 2 The extinction coefficient k for the most transparent of the obtained nanoceramics was calculated as follows: (5) k=- ln ( T 1 / T 2 ) x 1 - x 2

The specific surface area of Nd:YAG doped powders was 28m2/g. The average diameter of YAG particle (d BET) was determined using formula (1). The result was verified by Scherrer, Williamson–Hall method and fine analysis of diffraction profile Fig. 2 . Table 1 shows the values of grain size measured by all above methods and the density of the nanopowders.

The density of nanopowders is the level of 94% of the density of YAG single crystals, which is ρ YAG=4.55g/cm3. According to our experience YAG powder indicate of high crystalline quality and phase purity of the powders. Fig. 2 shows the grain size distribution (GSD) calculated using the fine analysis of diffraction profiles method. The XRD values give a slightly smaller values for grains size than the BET method, what my indicate some agglomeration of the powders.

The X-ray pattern of the sintered ceramics shows no other than YAG phases (Fig. 3 ). The XRD peaks are asymmetric and their width increase with 2θ, what indicate presence of microstrains. Microstrain and grain size Nd:YAG pellet calculated by Williamson-Hall method is 0.89% and 37nm appropriately (Fig. 4 ). Grain size of powder and pellet is almost the same (in the limit of experimental error). Grain size of powder is comparable with measured by other XRD techniques (Table 1).

The density of pellets measured using the Archimedes method is shown in Table 2 .

As it can be seen in Table 2, the pellet before sintering has about 50% of the theoretical density of YAG single crystal (ρ YAG=4.55g/cm3). The density increases significantly up to 4GPa compaction pressure, where it reaches the value of 99% of the theoretical density and above this pressure does not increase any more. The error of measurement is 8% measured by differential calculus of small changes.

The transparency of the samples increases when the sintering pressure increases from 6 to 8GPa (Fig. 5 ).

The transmittance of the most transparent Nd:YAG nanoceramic samples, i.e, that sintered at 450°C 8GPa for 1min, is shown in Fig. 6 . Transmittance for sample thickness x 1=0.142cm and x 2=0.116cm is shown. At wavelength 1064nm the absorption coefficients are T 1=36.9%, T 2=52.5% for x 1=0.142cm and x 2=0.116cm, respectively. According to Eq. (5) the extinction coefficient α is 13.6cm−1. The narrow peaks observed in the spectrum correspond to the absorption of Nd3+ ions and correspond to the f–f electron transition bands reported for the YAG single crystal [5,6]. The theoretical reflection loss, calculated using the refractive indices of YAG single crystal [30] are plotted in the Fig. 6 (dotted line).

The microstructure of the YAG nanoceramic sintered at 8GPa, 450°C, for 1min is shown in Fig. 7 . The grain size of the crystallites according to this picture is in range 30−50nm. The white areas between the grains represent pores of thickness of a few nanometers and length comparable to the particles size.

Table 3 shows a significant increase of microhardness with increase of temperature sintering.

The present results indicate that ultra high pressure sintering leads to formation of dense transparent YAG ceramics with a grain size in the range of 30–40nm. Average grain size of powder and pellet are close each other (Fig. 4) so there is no significant grain growth during sintering process. The nanoceramic obtained at 8GPa sintering pressure displays transparency T ≈50% for thickness x 1=0.142cm at wavelength 1064nm, which is wavelength range for Nd excitation and emission. The extinction coefficient k includes both the absorption and scattering factors. Its value 13.6cm−1 is much larger than reported recently for ceramics of YAG with microsized grains, where the absorption coefficient is less then 2.5cm−1 and the scattering coefficient<0.1cm−1. It confirms that the porosity of the present nanoceramics contributes to scattering of light and decrease of transparency comparing to that of single crystals or microcrystalline ceramics referred to in recent papers [32,36].

In general, the scattering can depend both on pore sizes and their concentration. However, when the pores sizes are below some critical value (depending on a light wavelength) the concentration of very small nanopores should not influent on scattering. In order to explain the effect of sintering pressure on transparency, we assumed in the first step that sintering pressure can reduce pore size significantly (below scattering criteria). Braun and Pilon have explained increase of transmittancy by reduction on pores size.

They proposed a quantitative criterion for neglecting Rayleigh scattering based on estimation of a size parameter χ, defined as χ=π/λ, where D is the pore diameter and λ is the incident wavelength. For no Rayleigh scattering χ ≪1. Fig. 8 shows χ as a function of pore size and wavelength. We assumed that the condition for low scattering coefficient of the sample is χ <0.1. Accordingly, the pore size for negligible scattering is D <15nm for wavelength 500nm, and D <35nm for λ=1100nm, respectively. The observed in the investigated sample decrease of transmittance with decreasing wavelength (Fig. 6) can be explained therefore in terms of presence of pores larger then 10nm.

From quantitative point of view, because in reality not all pores are below scattering criteria, another way to increase transmittance of ceramic samples is to decrease the number of larger pores. As disussed by Krell et al. [33–35], ceramic alumina with transmittance comparable to that of a single crystal can be obtained for porosity below 0.05vol%.

In the present work we try to obtain high transparency by applying high pressure to decrease the size of pores below the limit where they scatter light. It is natural to assume, that the pressure needed to close the pores increases as the size of the pores decreases. A pressure above 2GPa can lead to closure of the larger pores, for instance so called interagglomerate pores formed between agglomerates of nanoparticles present in the green body, while it may have little effect on the intra-agglomerate porosity. Closing of large pores via breaking of agglomerates and creation of a material with a uniform distribution of nano-sized pores was observed by Gierlotka et al. [38] during sintering of SiC nanoceramics at pressures above 2GPa.

The observed in previous work [28] structural decomposition of YAG nanopowders does not permit to increase the temperature of sintering above a certain limit. For 8GPa this temperature is 450°C. This temperature is much lower than the typical sintering temperatures, which even for nano-powders are above 0.5 of the melting point. Nevertheless, an increase of hardness of the ceramics compared to room temperature compaction was observed with increased sintering temperature. This effect can be explained by formation of grain boundaries between the nano-sized grains due to short range diffusion. However, the observed values are still much lower then reported for YAG single crystals [31]. Since the temperature of sintering cannot be increased, further increase of microhardness can be obtained by elongation of the sintering time.

It is interesting to note that the nanoceramic displays microstrains of 0.89%, which is reflected by broadening of XRD peaks. Such microstrains can be connected with elastic deformation of the nanograins, that under extreme pressure are forced to change their shapes to fit in the space available for them between their neighbours. Such strains may also arise at contacts between grains. Let us try to assess what are the stresses within the nanosized particles. According to [39] the elastic constants of YAG are C11 close to 333GPa and C12, C14 113, 115GPa, respectively. Using a very rough estimate that stress within a nanograin is σ=C11 ε where ε is microstrain, and ε=0.89%, we obtain that σ in range of 3GPa. The shear stress components would be accordingly close to 1GPa. The material displays high mechanical strength and stability despite such high internal microstrains. This might be the result of formation of grain boundaries between grains and high friction stresses at grain contacts. Control of the strains, grain size, ant their effect on the properties of YAG nanoceramics, will be a subject of our further studies.

The method of fabrication of ceramics composed of Nd:YAG nanosized grains by means of high pressure low temperature sintering technique was developed. In particular the effect of applied pressure on preparation of transparent YAG nanoceramics was studied. The optimal sintering condition for obtaining of optically transparent nanoceramics are temperature of 450°C and pressure of 8GPa. As result, a nanoporous and transparent sample with 37nm grains was obtained with extinction coefficient 13.6cm−1 for λ=1064nm. The microhardness of the nanoceramics takes values from 6.5GPa to 9.3GPa depending on the sintering conditions. There is a uniform distribution of nano-sized pores in the ceramics, which contributes to scattering of transmitted light. Further studies are needed to assess how the microstrains observed in the nanoceramics influence their optical and mechanical properties.

Abstract:
High-performance and low-carbon MgO–C refractories are important refractories for smelting ultra-low carbon steel and clean steel. Based on this, Cr3C2/C composite powders were synthesized by the molten-salt method, and used as an additive to prepare low-carbon MgO–C refractories under nitrogen atmosphere. The phase, morphology and oxidation kinetics of Cr3C2/C composite powders were studied. In addition, the effect of Cr3C2/C composite powders on the morphology, mechanical properties, thermal shock resistance, and corrosion resistance of MgO–C refractories was investigated. The results indicated that the Cr3C2/C composite powders exhibited superior oxidation resistance than flake graphite. Moreover, the Cr3C2/C composite powders were introduced into the MgO–C refractories. Compared with the sample without Cr3C2/C composite powders, the introduction of 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders significantly improved the thermomechanical properties and corrosion resistance of the material, its CMOR, CCS before and CCS after thermal shock were 9.06 MPa, 50.40 MPa and 32.60 MPa, respectively, and the corrosion index was significantly reduced from 44.6% to 26.5%.

Introduction:
In the context of the global low-carbon trend, carbon-containing refractories, as the key basic material for steel smelting in traditional industries, have been put forward with higher requirements. Among them, MgO–C refractories are valuable carbon-containing refractories developed in the late 1970s and are mainly used in steelmaking for converter, electric furnace, RH furnace linings, and ladle slag lines [1–4]. As the main source of carbon for MgO–C refractories, graphite gives MgO–C refractories excellent resistance to thermal shock and slag corrosion, and the content of graphite is generally 10–20 wt% [5,6]. Despite these advantages, the high carbon content of MgO–C refractories will lead to several problems: High energy loss and poor oxidation resistance [7,8]. Hence, the development of MgO–C refractories with both low carbon content and high performance is the consensus of researchers.
Several researchers have found that the introduction of modified graphite into carbon-containing refractories can effectively improve the properties of low-carbon carbon-containing refractories [9–13]. Among them, carbides are used to modify the surface of graphite, such as the preparation of SiC/C [14], TiC/C [15], and ZrC/C [16] composite powders, the resulting carbides form a good chemical bond with graphite, and the presence of the surface coating shows the oxidation of graphite at high temperatures. E.g., Masoudifar et al. [17] synthesized SiC coatings on the surface of flake graphite using 95 wt% KCl and 5 wt% NaF as the molten salt. The formation of SiC coatings improved the water wettability of graphite and acted as protective layers to enhance the oxidation resistance of flake graphite. Liu et al. [18] used a similar method to synthesize SiC/C composite powders and partially replaced graphite in low-carbon Al2O3–C refractories, which improved the oxidation resistance and slag resistance of materials.
Cr3C2 has high melting point, high hardness, good acid/alkali corrosion resistance, excellent chemical stability and oxidation resistance [19–22], and the Cr2O3 formed by its oxidation can react with Al, Fe and Mg in the alkaline slag to form high melting point spinels (e.g., MgCr2O4 and FeCr2O4), which can effectively inhibit the formation of Cr6+ and improve the corrosion resistance of the material [23]. Based on this, flake graphite is modified to form a Cr3C2 coated graphite structure, and then this composite material is further introduced into low-carbon MgO–C refractories to improve the oxidation resistance of materials. In addition, the excellent performance of Cr3C2 is expected to solve the problems of low strength, poor thermal shock resistance and corrosion resistance caused by low carbonization of MgO–C refractories.
In this work, we used molten-salt method to prepare modified graphite (Cr3C2/C composite powders). The oxidation activation energies of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders were calculated using the Kissinger equation. Then the composite powders were introduced into low-carbon MgO–C refractories, and the effect of Cr3C2/C composite powders on the morphology and properties (mechanical properties, thermal shock resistance and corrosion resistance) of low-carbon MgO–C refractories under nitrogen atmosphere were investigated.

Experimental:
2.1 Raw materials and sample preparation For the synthesis of the Cr3C2/C composite powders, the molten-salt mediums were NaCl (≥99.0 wt%; Tianjin, China) and NaF (≥98.0 wt%; Shanghai, China), and the main raw materials were Cr powder (≤0.003 mm, ≥98.0 wt%; Beijing, China) and flake graphite (C, ≤0.074 mm, ≥98.0 wt%; Jixi, China). The mass ratio of the molten-salt mediums (the mass ratio of NaCl and NaF was 10:1) and the main raw materials (the mole ratio of Cr and flake graphite was 1:2) was 3:2. The mixed raw materials were heated at 950 °C for 3 h in flowing Ar. After that, the reaction products were washed several times with deionized water to remove the molten-salt medium and obtain composite powders. The fused magnesia (MgO, ≥98.0 wt%, 3–1 mm, ≤1 mm, ≤0.074 mm; Gongyi, China), flake graphite (C, ≤0.074 mm, ≥98.0 wt%; Jixi, China) and silicon powder (Si, ≥98.0 wt%, ≤0.074 mm; Xingtai, China) were the raw materials of MgO–C refractories. The liquid phenolic resin was used as the binder, and the synthetic Cr3C2/C composite powders were severed as additives. The compositions of MgO–C refractories were shown in Table 1 . The mixed raw materials were pressed into strip samples with the size of 140 mm × 25 mm × 25 mm, cylindrical samples with the size of Φ36 mm × H36 mm, and crucible samples with outer dimensions of Φ50 mm × H50 mm and inner hole dimensions of Φ22 mm × H18 mm at 150 MPa. Next, these samples were cured at 200 °C for 24 h. Furthermore, crucible samples were used to test slag corrosion resistance; and other samples were sintered at a rate of 5 °C/min to 1450 °C for 3 h under the flowing nitrogen (purity ≥99.999%), then used to test the mechanical properties and thermal shock resistance of materials.
2.2 Characterization and testing The phase composition was analyzed using an X–ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert Pro, Philips). The morphology was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, ThermoFisher, Apreo S HiVac) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM2100F, JEOL). The synchronous differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry analysis thermal analyzer (TG–DSC, STA499F3, NETZSCH) was used to calculate the oxidation activation energies of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders (heating temperature was 25–1200 °C; heating rates were 5 °C/min, 10 °C/min, 15 °C/min, 20 °C/min, respectively). The apparent porosity (AP), bulk density (BD), cold modulus of rupture (CMOR) and cold crushing strength (CCS) of samples were measured. Nano CT detection system (phoenix v|tome|x s–nano CT) was used to observe the internal structural of the samples. The thermal shock resistance test method of the sample was as follows: Samples were heating at 1100 °C in air for 30 min, then these samples were rapidly cooled by compressed air flow for 5 min, this marked the completion of one thermal shock cycle; the residual CCS was tested after 2 thermal shock cycles. The static crucible method was used to test the slag corrosion resistance [5]: 12 g of ladle slag (Table 2 ) was put into a drilled hole of crucible samples and all the crucibles samples were heated at 1400 °C for 3 h in air; after testing, the samples were vertically cut to observe the corrosion of the ladle slag. Then the Image-Pro Plus software was used to measure the erosion area of the corroded samples, and the corrosion indexes of samples were calculated according to Eq. (1).

Raw Materials And Sample Preparation:
For the synthesis of the Cr3C2/C composite powders, the molten-salt mediums were NaCl (≥99.0 wt%; Tianjin, China) and NaF (≥98.0 wt%; Shanghai, China), and the main raw materials were Cr powder (≤0.003 mm, ≥98.0 wt%; Beijing, China) and flake graphite (C, ≤0.074 mm, ≥98.0 wt%; Jixi, China). The mass ratio of the molten-salt mediums (the mass ratio of NaCl and NaF was 10:1) and the main raw materials (the mole ratio of Cr and flake graphite was 1:2) was 3:2.

After that, the reaction products were washed several times with deionized water to remove the molten-salt medium and obtain composite powders.

The liquid phenolic resin was used as the binder, and the synthetic Cr3C2/C composite powders were severed as additives. The compositions of MgO–C refractories were shown in Table 1 . The mixed raw materials were pressed into strip samples with the size of 140 mm × 25 mm × 25 mm, cylindrical samples with the size of Φ36 mm × H36 mm, and crucible samples with outer dimensions of Φ50 mm × H50 mm and inner hole dimensions of Φ22 mm × H18 mm at 150 MPa. Next, these samples were cured at 200 °C for 24 h. Furthermore, crucible samples were used to test slag corrosion resistance; and other samples were sintered at a rate of 5 °C/min to 1450 °C for 3 h under the flowing nitrogen (purity ≥99.999%), then used to test the mechanical properties and thermal shock resistance of materials.

Results And Discussion:
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders. Compared with the XRD pattern of flake graphite, a large number of Cr3C2 diffraction peaks were detected, and Cr phase was not detected, which indicated that the Cr powders in the molten salt have reacted completely. The morphologies of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders were observed by SEM. As shown in Fig. 2 , the surface of flake graphite was smooth (Fig. 2a), while the surface of Cr3C2/C composite powders had several micro-pores, and a great deal of Cr3C2 grains coated on the surface of flake graphite (Fig. 2b).
Fig. 3 shows the TEM, HRTEM and SAED images of Cr3C2/C composite powders. As shown in Fig. 3a, the grains were consistent with the Cr3C2 grains morphology observed in Fig. 2b. Fig. 3b was magnified HRTEM image of Fig. 3a, and the measured lattice spacing was 2.088 Å, which corresponded to the (1 1 3) crystal spacing of Cr3C2 grains. The SAED image in Fig. 3c corresponded to the (1 1 0), (0 1 1) and (1 2 1) crystal planes of Cr3C2 grains, further confirming that the grains in Fig. 3a were Cr3C2.
To evaluate the oxidation kinetics of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders, the oxidation activation energy of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders were calculated by using Kissinger equation. Fig. 4 shows the DSC curves of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders at different heating rates. Based on the heating rates and corresponding temperatures, the corresponding parameters of Kissinger equation [18,24] (Eq. (2)) were calculated as shown in Table 3 . The calculated parameters were processed by linear fitting to obtain fitted plots (Fig. 4c). The correlation coefficients (R2) of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders were 0.997 and 0.988, respectively, which indicated high degree of linear fitting. Comparing the Kissinger equation with fitted equations, the oxidation activation energies of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders were 212.84 kJ/mol and 268.01 kJ/mol, which indicated that the Cr3C2/C composite powders had superior oxidation resistance than that of flake graphite.

Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns with magnified portion (2θ=30–40°) of MgO–C refractories containing 0–3 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders after nitriding at 1450 °C for 3 h. The main phases in the samples without Cr3C2/C composite powders were MgO, graphite, SiC, Si3N4 and Mg2SiO4. With the addition of Cr3C2/C composite powders increased to 3 wt%, a new phase of MgCr2O4 was detected. During the nitriding process, flake graphite could react with MgO and underwent indirect oxidation (Eq. (3)) [25,26]. And the added Cr3C2 could participate in the reaction of Eq. (4) to generate Cr2O3, and then Cr2O3 generated MgCr2O4 through Eq. (5), that is, the total reaction is as shown in Eq. (6). In addition, this was due to the fact that low addition of Cr3C2/C composite powders (1 and 2 wt%), resulting in less generation of MgCr2O4, and it was difficult to be observed. (3) MgO(s)+C(s)=CO(g)+Mg(g) (4) 2Cr3C2(s)+9CO(g)=3Cr2O3(s)+13C(s) (5) MgO(s)+Cr2O3(s)=MgCr2O4(s) (6) MgO(s)+2/3Cr3C2(s)+3CO(g)=MgCr2O4(s)+13/3C(s)
Fig. 6 shows the SEM images of samples containing 0–3 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders nitrided at 1450 °C for 3 h. As shown in Fig. 6a–h, plate-shaped Mg2SiO4 grains, irregularly shaped SiC grains and columnar Si3N4 grains were observed in all group samples. With the increase in the amount of Cr3C2/C composite powders added, the size of the plate-shaped Mg2SiO4 grains decreased (Table 4 ). This is due to two aspects: (1) Since the introduced Cr3C2 could react with CO(g) in the reaction system (Eq. (4)), this reduced the content of CO(g) in the system, and combined with Eq. (7), it can be found that this inhibited the growth of Mg2SiO4; (2) the formation of Cr2O3 increased the liquid viscosity of the reaction system, which reduced the diffusion rate of atoms or ions, thereby inhibiting the growth of Mg2SiO4. In addition, the irregularly shaped MgCr2O4 grains were observed in the samples with 3 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders (Fig. 6h). (7) 2MgO(s)+SiO(g)+CO(g)=Mg2SiO4(s)+C(s)
The physical properties of samples with 0–3 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders after nitriding at 1450 °C for 3 h are showed in Figs. 7–9 . With the increase of the amount of composite powders added, the AP of the sample first decreased and then increased, and the BD showed the opposite trend of change (Fig. 7). When the addition of the composite powders was 1 wt%, the sample exhibited a higher density. This is because the introduction of a small amount of composite powders could fill the pores between the particles, and the generated ceramic phases made the sample produce micro-expansion to further seal the pores and improve the density of the material. In addition, although the introduction of composite powders inhibited the formation of Mg2SiO4 and reduced its grain size (Fig. 6), Mg2SiO4 still maintained a larger size when the amount of composite powders was 1–2 wt%. Therefore, compared with the sample without Cr3C2/C composite powders (CMOR, CCS, and CCS after thermal shock were 7.23, 38.30 and 26.10 MPa, respectively), the addition of 1 and 2 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders (CMOR, CCS, and CCS after thermal shock were 8.62–9.06, 42.60–50.40 and 28.47–32.60 MPa, respectively) improved the CMOR and CCS of refractories, and the material still exhibited a higher CCS value after thermal shock (Figs. 8 and 9). However, as the addition of the composite powders increased to 3 wt%, the production of a higher content of MgCr2O4 could cause the material to produce excessive volume expansion and aggravate the generation of microcracks, which reduced the bulk density and mechanical strength of the material.
Figs. 10 and 11 show the industrial CT images of samples with 0 wt% and 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders nitrided at 1450 °C, respectively. Fig. 10a–d shows the 3–D view, cross–sectional view, longitudinal section I, and longitudinal section II of sample without Cr3C2/C composite powders, respectively. In Fig. 10b–d and Fig. 11b–d, the gray parts were aggregates, the black parts were matrix, the colored parts were pores, and the different colors indicated different pore sizes [27,28]. The pores in sample without Cr3C2/C composite powders were mainly concentrated at the edges of aggregates, which indicated that the bond between aggregates and matrix was not tight, and intergranular fracture was more likely to occur. Additionally, the color of pores in the CT cross–sectional view of samples was basically red (Fig. 10b–d), which indicated that there were more large-size pores in the samples. In contrast, the pores in sample containing 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders were partly located at the edges of aggregate and partly in matrix. A small number of pores were blue in the CT cross-sectional view of samples (Fig. 11b–d), which indicated that there were some small-size pores in the samples in addition to some-large size pores. The defect volume ratios of samples were calculated using industrial CT and according to Eq. (8), and the results were shown in Table 5 . The defect volume ratios of samples with addition of 0 wt% and 1 wt% of Cr3C2/C composite powders were 39.10% and 20.44%, respectively, this indicated that the introduction of 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders significantly reduced the defects (e.g., pores and cracks) of samples. (8) R=D M + D × 100 % where R is the defect volume ratio (unit: %); M is the material volume without the defect volume (unit: mm3); D is the defect volume (unit: mm3), which is the total volume of closed pores and microcracks in the material.
The static crucible method was used to study the effect of Cr3C2/C composite powders on corrosion resistance of samples. Fig. 12 shows cross-sections of samples with 0 wt% and 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders after corrosion test at 1400 °C for 3 h in air, the blue dashed line corresponds to the inner hole contour of the crucible, and the red dashed line corresponds to the contour of slag corrosion. As shown in Fig. 12a, the sample without Cr3C2/C composite powders showed obvious erosion layer due to the slag corrosion, and there were several pores in the contact part between the slag and sample. In the sample containing 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders, the pores in the contact part of slag and sample were significantly reduced (Fig. 12b), and the corrosion depth of the slag was reduced, which demonstrated the excellent corrosion resistance of sample containing 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders. The corrosion indices of samples containing 0 wt% and 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders were calculated and the results were shown in Fig. 13 . The corrosion indexes of samples with 0 wt% and 1 wt% of Cr3C2/C composite powders were 44.6% and 26.5%, respectively. This further indicated that the addition of 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powder could effectively improve the corrosion resistance of the sample.
SEM was used to further observe the effect of the addition of Cr3C2/C composite powders on the corrosion resistance of MgO–C refractories. Fig. 14 shows the morphologies of samples containing 0 wt% and 1 wt% of Cr3C2/C composite powders after corrosion tests at 1400 °C for 3 h. As shown in Fig. 14, the samples after corrosion tests had a clear boundary between the erosion layer and penetration layer, and the ladle slag penetrated through pores and cracks. In the erosion layer region of sample without Cr3C2/C composite powders (Fig. 14a), the matrix was severely eroded by the slag [29]; moreover, the microstructure of sample was severely damaged and the pore size was larger. However, in the erosion layer region of sample containing 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders, the size of pores reduced (Fig. 14b).
The results of the energy spectrum analysis at points 1–8 in Fig. 14 are shown in Table 6 . As shown in Fig. 14a, it was evident that the Fe content in the corroded samples reduced significantly from the erosion region to penetration region. This is due to three reasons: (1) FeO in the slag was oxidized to Fe2O3 under air, or reduced by carbon (Eq. (9)), and the viscosity of the slag was increased, which reduced the penetration rate of the slag; (2) MgO reacted with Fe2O3 to form MgFe2O4, which fixed some of the Fe2O3 in slag (Eq. (10)), thus inhibiting the penetration of slag; (3) the oxidation of SiC and Si3N4 in samples produced SiO2, and the reaction of SiO2, CaO and MgO formed some low-melting phases (Eqs. (11) and (12)), which increased the viscosity of slag. (9) 3C(s)+Fe2O3(s)=2Fe(l)+3CO(g) (10) MgO(s)+Fe2O3(s)=MgFe2O4(s) (11) 2CaO(s)+SiO2(s)=2CaO·SiO2(s) (12) MgO(s)+3CaO(s)+2SiO2(s)=3CaO·MgO·2SiO2(s)
For the samples with 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders, Cr element was detected in the erosion region of points 5 and 6. Under the combined action of oxidation and erosion, the introduced Cr3C2 underwent a series of chemical reactions to generate MgCr2O4, Mg(AlxCr1-x)2O4 and FeCr2O4 spinels, which reduced the Mg, Fe and Al elements in the slag, thereby effectively inhibiting the penetration of slag [30]. Therefore, compared with the sample without composite powders, the sample with 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders showed a lower corrosion index (Fig. 13).

Conclusions:
The Cr3C2/C composite powders synthesized by the molten salt method were used as additives in low-carbon MgO–C refractories, and the effect of the addition amount of Cr3C2/C composite powders on the morphology, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of MgO–C refractories was investigated. The prepared composite powders was Cr3C2 coated graphite structure, which effectively improved the oxidation resistance of graphite, and its oxidation activation energy was 268.01 kJ/mol. Compared with the sample without composite powders, the sample with 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders showed higher density and mechanical properties. In addition, the introduction of Cr3C2 reacted with the components in the slag to form spinels (e.g., MgCr2O4, Mg(AlxCr1-x)2O4 and FeCr2O4) with high melting point, which increased the viscosity of the slag and inhibited the further penetration of the slag, thereby significantly improving the corrosion resistance of refractories.

Based on this, flake graphite is modified to form a Cr3C2 coated graphite structure, and then this composite material is further introduced into low-carbon MgO–C refractories to improve the oxidation resistance of materials. In addition, the excellent performance of Cr3C2 is expected to solve the problems of low strength, poor thermal shock resistance and corrosion resistance caused by low carbonization of MgO–C refractories.

In this work, we used molten-salt method to prepare modified graphite (Cr3C2/C composite powders). The oxidation activation energies of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders were calculated using the Kissinger equation. Then the composite powders were introduced into low-carbon MgO–C refractories, and the effect of Cr3C2/C composite powders on the morphology and properties (mechanical properties, thermal shock resistance and corrosion resistance) of low-carbon MgO–C refractories under nitrogen atmosphere were investigated.

For the synthesis of the Cr3C2/C composite powders, the molten-salt mediums were NaCl (≥99.0 wt%; Tianjin, China) and NaF (≥98.0 wt%; Shanghai, China), and the main raw materials were Cr powder (≤0.003 mm, ≥98.0 wt%; Beijing, China) and flake graphite (C, ≤0.074 mm, ≥98.0 wt%; Jixi, China). The mass ratio of the molten-salt mediums (the mass ratio of NaCl and NaF was 10:1) and the main raw materials (the mole ratio of Cr and flake graphite was 1:2) was 3:2. The mixed raw materials were heated at 950 °C for 3 h in flowing Ar. After that, the reaction products were washed several times with deionized water to remove the molten-salt medium and obtain composite powders.

The fused magnesia (MgO, ≥98.0 wt%, 3–1 mm, ≤1 mm, ≤0.074 mm; Gongyi, China), flake graphite (C, ≤0.074 mm, ≥98.0 wt%; Jixi, China) and silicon powder (Si, ≥98.0 wt%, ≤0.074 mm; Xingtai, China) were the raw materials of MgO–C refractories. The liquid phenolic resin was used as the binder, and the synthetic Cr3C2/C composite powders were severed as additives. The compositions of MgO–C refractories were shown in Table 1 . The mixed raw materials were pressed into strip samples with the size of 140 mm × 25 mm × 25 mm, cylindrical samples with the size of Φ36 mm × H36 mm, and crucible samples with outer dimensions of Φ50 mm × H50 mm and inner hole dimensions of Φ22 mm × H18 mm at 150 MPa. Next, these samples were cured at 200 °C for 24 h. Furthermore, crucible samples were used to test slag corrosion resistance; and other samples were sintered at a rate of 5 °C/min to 1450 °C for 3 h under the flowing nitrogen (purity ≥99.999%), then used to test the mechanical properties and thermal shock resistance of materials.

The phase composition was analyzed using an X–ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert Pro, Philips). The morphology was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, ThermoFisher, Apreo S HiVac) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM2100F, JEOL). The synchronous differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry analysis thermal analyzer (TG–DSC, STA499F3, NETZSCH) was used to calculate the oxidation activation energies of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders (heating temperature was 25–1200 °C; heating rates were 5 °C/min, 10 °C/min, 15 °C/min, 20 °C/min, respectively).

The apparent porosity (AP), bulk density (BD), cold modulus of rupture (CMOR) and cold crushing strength (CCS) of samples were measured. Nano CT detection system (phoenix v|tome|x s–nano CT) was used to observe the internal structural of the samples. The thermal shock resistance test method of the sample was as follows: Samples were heating at 1100 °C in air for 30 min, then these samples were rapidly cooled by compressed air flow for 5 min, this marked the completion of one thermal shock cycle; the residual CCS was tested after 2 thermal shock cycles. The static crucible method was used to test the slag corrosion resistance [5]: 12 g of ladle slag (Table 2 ) was put into a drilled hole of crucible samples and all the crucibles samples were heated at 1400 °C for 3 h in air; after testing, the samples were vertically cut to observe the corrosion of the ladle slag. Then the Image-Pro Plus software was used to measure the erosion area of the corroded samples, and the corrosion indexes of samples were calculated according to Eq. (1). (1) D=Ico - Icr Icr × 100 % where D means the corrosion index (unit: %); Ico means the corrosion area including the crucible area; Icr means the crucible area.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders. Compared with the XRD pattern of flake graphite, a large number of Cr3C2 diffraction peaks were detected, and Cr phase was not detected, which indicated that the Cr powders in the molten salt have reacted completely. The morphologies of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders were observed by SEM. As shown in Fig. 2 , the surface of flake graphite was smooth (Fig. 2a), while the surface of Cr3C2/C composite powders had several micro-pores, and a great deal of Cr3C2 grains coated on the surface of flake graphite (Fig. 2b).

Fig. 3 shows the TEM, HRTEM and SAED images of Cr3C2/C composite powders. As shown in Fig. 3a, the grains were consistent with the Cr3C2 grains morphology observed in Fig. 2b. Fig. 3b was magnified HRTEM image of Fig. 3a, and the measured lattice spacing was 2.088 Å, which corresponded to the (1 1 3) crystal spacing of Cr3C2 grains. The SAED image in Fig. 3c corresponded to the (1 1 0), (0 1 1) and (1 2 1) crystal planes of Cr3C2 grains, further confirming that the grains in Fig. 3a were Cr3C2.

To evaluate the oxidation kinetics of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders, the oxidation activation energy of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders were calculated by using Kissinger equation. Fig. 4 shows the DSC curves of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders at different heating rates. Based on the heating rates and corresponding temperatures, the corresponding parameters of Kissinger equation [18,24] (Eq. (2)) were calculated as shown in Table 3 . The calculated parameters were processed by linear fitting to obtain fitted plots (Fig. 4c). The correlation coefficients (R2) of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders were 0.997 and 0.988, respectively, which indicated high degree of linear fitting. Comparing the Kissinger equation with fitted equations, the oxidation activation energies of flake graphite and Cr3C2/C composite powders were 212.84 kJ/mol and 268.01 kJ/mol, which indicated that the Cr3C2/C composite powders had superior oxidation resistance than that of flake graphite.

Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns with magnified portion (2θ=30–40°) of MgO–C refractories containing 0–3 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders after nitriding at 1450 °C for 3 h. The main phases in the samples without Cr3C2/C composite powders were MgO, graphite, SiC, Si3N4 and Mg2SiO4. With the addition of Cr3C2/C composite powders increased to 3 wt%, a new phase of MgCr2O4 was detected. During the nitriding process, flake graphite could react with MgO and underwent indirect oxidation (Eq. (3)) [25,26]. And the added Cr3C2 could participate in the reaction of Eq. (4) to generate Cr2O3, and then Cr2O3 generated MgCr2O4 through Eq. (5), that is, the total reaction is as shown in Eq. (6). In addition, this was due to the fact that low addition of Cr3C2/C composite powders (1 and 2 wt%), resulting in less generation of MgCr2O4, and it was difficult to be observed. (3) MgO(s)+C(s)=CO(g)+Mg(g) (4) 2Cr3C2(s)+9CO(g)=3Cr2O3(s)+13C(s) (5) MgO(s)+Cr2O3(s)=MgCr2O4(s) (6) MgO(s)+2/3Cr3C2(s)+3CO(g)=MgCr2O4(s)+13/3C(s)

Fig. 6 shows the SEM images of samples containing 0–3 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders nitrided at 1450 °C for 3 h. As shown in Fig. 6a–h, plate-shaped Mg2SiO4 grains, irregularly shaped SiC grains and columnar Si3N4 grains were observed in all group samples. With the increase in the amount of Cr3C2/C composite powders added, the size of the plate-shaped Mg2SiO4 grains decreased (Table 4 ). This is due to two aspects: (1) Since the introduced Cr3C2 could react with CO(g) in the reaction system (Eq. (4)), this reduced the content of CO(g) in the system, and combined with Eq. (7), it can be found that this inhibited the growth of Mg2SiO4; (2) the formation of Cr2O3 increased the liquid viscosity of the reaction system, which reduced the diffusion rate of atoms or ions, thereby inhibiting the growth of Mg2SiO4. In addition, the irregularly shaped MgCr2O4 grains were observed in the samples with 3 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders (Fig. 6h). (7) 2MgO(s)+SiO(g)+CO(g)=Mg2SiO4(s)+C(s)

The physical properties of samples with 0–3 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders after nitriding at 1450 °C for 3 h are showed in Figs. 7–9 . With the increase of the amount of composite powders added, the AP of the sample first decreased and then increased, and the BD showed the opposite trend of change (Fig. 7). When the addition of the composite powders was 1 wt%, the sample exhibited a higher density. This is because the introduction of a small amount of composite powders could fill the pores between the particles, and the generated ceramic phases made the sample produce micro-expansion to further seal the pores and improve the density of the material. In addition, although the introduction of composite powders inhibited the formation of Mg2SiO4 and reduced its grain size (Fig. 6), Mg2SiO4 still maintained a larger size when the amount of composite powders was 1–2 wt%. Therefore, compared with the sample without Cr3C2/C composite powders (CMOR, CCS, and CCS after thermal shock were 7.23, 38.30 and 26.10 MPa, respectively), the addition of 1 and 2 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders (CMOR, CCS, and CCS after thermal shock were 8.62–9.06, 42.60–50.40 and 28.47–32.60 MPa, respectively) improved the CMOR and CCS of refractories, and the material still exhibited a higher CCS value after thermal shock (Figs. 8 and 9). However, as the addition of the composite powders increased to 3 wt%, the production of a higher content of MgCr2O4 could cause the material to produce excessive volume expansion and aggravate the generation of microcracks, which reduced the bulk density and mechanical strength of the material.

Figs. 10 and 11 show the industrial CT images of samples with 0 wt% and 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders nitrided at 1450 °C, respectively. Fig. 10a–d shows the 3–D view, cross–sectional view, longitudinal section I, and longitudinal section II of sample without Cr3C2/C composite powders, respectively. In Fig. 10b–d and Fig. 11b–d, the gray parts were aggregates, the black parts were matrix, the colored parts were pores, and the different colors indicated different pore sizes [27,28]. The pores in sample without Cr3C2/C composite powders were mainly concentrated at the edges of aggregates, which indicated that the bond between aggregates and matrix was not tight, and intergranular fracture was more likely to occur. Additionally, the color of pores in the CT cross–sectional view of samples was basically red (Fig. 10b–d), which indicated that there were more large-size pores in the samples. In contrast, the pores in sample containing 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders were partly located at the edges of aggregate and partly in matrix. A small number of pores were blue in the CT cross-sectional view of samples (Fig. 11b–d), which indicated that there were some small-size pores in the samples in addition to some-large size pores. The defect volume ratios of samples were calculated using industrial CT and according to Eq. (8), and the results were shown in Table 5 . The defect volume ratios of samples with addition of 0 wt% and 1 wt% of Cr3C2/C composite powders were 39.10% and 20.44%, respectively, this indicated that the introduction of 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders significantly reduced the defects (e.g., pores and cracks) of samples. (8) R=D M + D × 100 % where R is the defect volume ratio (unit: %); M is the material volume without the defect volume (unit: mm3); D is the defect volume (unit: mm3), which is the total volume of closed pores and microcracks in the material.

The static crucible method was used to study the effect of Cr3C2/C composite powders on corrosion resistance of samples. Fig. 12 shows cross-sections of samples with 0 wt% and 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders after corrosion test at 1400 °C for 3 h in air, the blue dashed line corresponds to the inner hole contour of the crucible, and the red dashed line corresponds to the contour of slag corrosion. As shown in Fig. 12a, the sample without Cr3C2/C composite powders showed obvious erosion layer due to the slag corrosion, and there were several pores in the contact part between the slag and sample. In the sample containing 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders, the pores in the contact part of slag and sample were significantly reduced (Fig. 12b), and the corrosion depth of the slag was reduced, which demonstrated the excellent corrosion resistance of sample containing 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders. The corrosion indices of samples containing 0 wt% and 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders were calculated and the results were shown in Fig. 13 . The corrosion indexes of samples with 0 wt% and 1 wt% of Cr3C2/C composite powders were 44.6% and 26.5%, respectively. This further indicated that the addition of 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powder could effectively improve the corrosion resistance of the sample.

SEM was used to further observe the effect of the addition of Cr3C2/C composite powders on the corrosion resistance of MgO–C refractories. Fig. 14 shows the morphologies of samples containing 0 wt% and 1 wt% of Cr3C2/C composite powders after corrosion tests at 1400 °C for 3 h. As shown in Fig. 14, the samples after corrosion tests had a clear boundary between the erosion layer and penetration layer, and the ladle slag penetrated through pores and cracks. In the erosion layer region of sample without Cr3C2/C composite powders (Fig. 14a), the matrix was severely eroded by the slag [29]; moreover, the microstructure of sample was severely damaged and the pore size was larger. However, in the erosion layer region of sample containing 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders, the size of pores reduced (Fig. 14b).

The results of the energy spectrum analysis at points 1–8 in Fig. 14 are shown in Table 6 . As shown in Fig. 14a, it was evident that the Fe content in the corroded samples reduced significantly from the erosion region to penetration region. This is due to three reasons: (1) FeO in the slag was oxidized to Fe2O3 under air, or reduced by carbon (Eq. (9)), and the viscosity of the slag was increased, which reduced the penetration rate of the slag; (2) MgO reacted with Fe2O3 to form MgFe2O4, which fixed some of the Fe2O3 in slag (Eq. (10)), thus inhibiting the penetration of slag; (3) the oxidation of SiC and Si3N4 in samples produced SiO2, and the reaction of SiO2, CaO and MgO formed some low-melting phases (Eqs. (11) and (12)), which increased the viscosity of slag. (9) 3C(s)+Fe2O3(s)=2Fe(l)+3CO(g) (10) MgO(s)+Fe2O3(s)=MgFe2O4(s) (11) 2CaO(s)+SiO2(s)=2CaO·SiO2(s) (12) MgO(s)+3CaO(s)+2SiO2(s)=3CaO·MgO·2SiO2(s)

For the samples with 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders, Cr element was detected in the erosion region of points 5 and 6. Under the combined action of oxidation and erosion, the introduced Cr3C2 underwent a series of chemical reactions to generate MgCr2O4, Mg(AlxCr1-x)2O4 and FeCr2O4 spinels, which reduced the Mg, Fe and Al elements in the slag, thereby effectively inhibiting the penetration of slag [30]. Therefore, compared with the sample without composite powders, the sample with 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders showed a lower corrosion index (Fig. 13).

The Cr3C2/C composite powders synthesized by the molten salt method were used as additives in low-carbon MgO–C refractories, and the effect of the addition amount of Cr3C2/C composite powders on the morphology, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of MgO–C refractories was investigated. The prepared composite powders was Cr3C2 coated graphite structure, which effectively improved the oxidation resistance of graphite, and its oxidation activation energy was 268.01 kJ/mol. Compared with the sample without composite powders, the sample with 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders showed higher density and mechanical properties. In addition, the introduction of Cr3C2 reacted with the components in the slag to form spinels (e.g., MgCr2O4, Mg(AlxCr1-x)2O4 and FeCr2O4) with high melting point, which increased the viscosity of the slag and inhibited the further penetration of the slag, thereby significantly improving the corrosion resistance of refractories.

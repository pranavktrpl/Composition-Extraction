Footer: {'1': '*Perpendicular to pressing direction at room temperature. The density of the samples was determined on mass and geometry. 2The electrical resistivity was determined by a DC four-probe method. 3Thermal conductivity at room temperature was measured by the thermal gradient method (the measuring method and the instrument is the same with [11]). 4The bending strength was tested by a three-point bending method.'}

Title: Effect of Calcium on Nd:GdVO4 single crystal

Abstract: The Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal and Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals were grown by the Czochralski method; the lattice parameters of the crystals were determined by XRD. The results showed that substituting Nd3+ caused an increase in lattice parameter; the segregation coefficient of Nd3+ ions in the crystal is lower than that of Nd:GdVO4 crystal; the absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra, absorption cross-section and the emission cross-section of the Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal were investigated at room temperature; furthermore, the Raman performance of Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal was improved.

Emission cross-section:
Based on the Juddâ€“Ofelt theory, the emission cross-sections in this crystal were calculated.

Title: The green upconversion emission mechanism investigation of GdVO4:Yb3+  Er3+ via tuning of the sensitizer concentration

Abstract: GdVO4:Yb3+, Er3+ powder was synthesized by a conventional solid state reaction. The XRD pattern confirmed that the GdVO4:Yb3+, Er3+ powder phosphors have tetragonal structure. The up-conversion photoluminescence (UCPL) spectrum consisted of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (554 nm) transition. The UCPL intensity of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) is stronger than 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (554 nm) by adjusting Yb3+ concentrations. In order to explain this behavior, we investigated a pump power dependence.

Experimental details:
The XRD data were collected in the range of 15–70° for scan speed 2°/min by using Philips, X'pert-MPD system X-ray diffractometer with 3 kW Cu-Кα (λ = 1.54056 Å) X-ray tube. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, JSM-6700, JEOL) attached to a scanning electron microscope was used for chemical analysis. The surface morphology of the powders was examined by scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-6700, JEOL). A 975 nm continuous wave laser diode was employed as the pumping source to obtain the luminescence spectra. The emitted light was focused into a 75 cm monochromator and detected by a thermoelectrically cooled photomultiplier tube. The signal was fed to a digital oscilloscope.

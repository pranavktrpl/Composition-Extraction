Title: Synthesis  crystal structure  and magnetic properties of the oxometallates KBaMnO4 and KBaAsO4

Abstract: Single crystals of KBaMnO4 and KBaAsO4 were grown using the hydroflux method and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Both compounds crystallize in the orthorhombic space group Pnma with a = 7.7795(4) Å, b = 5.8263(3) Å, and c = 10.2851(5) Å for the manganate and a = 7.7773(10) Å, b = 5.8891(8) Å, and c = 10.3104(13) Å for the arsenate. The materials exhibit a three-dimensional crystal structure consisting of isolated MnO4                      3− or AsO4                      3− tetrahedra, with the charge balance maintained by K+ and Ba2+. Each tetrahedron is surrounded by six K+ and five Ba2+, and shares its corner/edge with KO10 polyhedra and corner/edge/face with BaO9 polyhedra, respectively. The crystal growth, crystal structure and magnetic properties are discussed.

Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS):
Elemental analysis was performed on the crystals using a Tescan Vega 3 scanning electron microscope (SEM) with EDS capabilities. The crystals were mounted on carbon tape and analyzed using a 30 kV accelerating voltage and an accumulation time of 15 s. As a qualitative measure, the EDS confirmed the presence of each element and corroborated the approximate elemental ratios.

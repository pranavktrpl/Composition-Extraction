Title: New “Y” type nonlinear optical chromophores with good transparency and enhanced nonlinear optical effects

Abstract: Two new “Y” type triaryl amino chromophores with tricyanovinyldihydrofuran groups as electronic acceptor are synthesized and found to exhibit blue-shifted absorption in comparison with the corresponding D–π–A analogues while demonstrating significantly enhanced optical nonlinearity, as well as good thermal stability.

Conclusions:
In summary, we have synthesized two new “Y” type chromophores with triphenyl amino groups as the donor, bridged to one of the strongest known acceptors, TCF, via vinyl furan or thiophene linkages. The two chromophores demonstrated enhanced nonlinear response without sacrifice in their transparency but with a similar absorption in comparison with their corresponding D–π–A analogues, also they are thermally stable up to 280 °C. Thus, the two chromophores may be used as NLO active moieties in the practical EO applications.

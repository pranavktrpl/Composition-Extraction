Title: Density and size effects on the thermal conductivity of atomic layer deposited TiO2 and Al2O3 thin films

Abstract: We report on the room temperature thermal conductivity of atomic layer deposition-grown amorphous TiO2 and Al2O3 thin films as a function of film thickness and atomic density. For films thinner than 50 nm, we measure an effective thermal conductivity that is reduced with decreasing film thickness. This dependence is attributed to the increased influence of thermal boundary resistances as film thickness is reduced. In addition, we fit for a thickness-independent intrinsic thermal conductivity using a series-resistor model. For films thicker than ∼50 nm, there is no significant dependence on thickness or substrate. We observe a dependence of the thermal conductivity on density, which agrees well with a differential effective-medium approximation modified minimum limit model.

We determine the uncertainty in our measurements by considering two different sources. First, we calculate the standard deviation among the entire set of measurements for each sample. Second, we determine the change in thermal conductivity due to perturbing the aluminum transducer thickness by ±5 nm in our analysis. From this, we construct our total measurement error by taking the square root of the sum of the squares (RMS) of each source of uncertainty. The uncertainty for the intrinsic thermal conductivity of the thin films backed out from the resistor model, as further described in the next section, is derived by taking the upper and lower bounds defined by the standard deviation of the measured boundary conductance for each film and calculating the effective thermal conductivity for both cases. We then calculate the standard deviation and calculate the RMS error.

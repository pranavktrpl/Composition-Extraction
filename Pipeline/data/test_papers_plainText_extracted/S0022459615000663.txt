Title: Effects of additions of carbon nanotubes on the thermoelectric properties of Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6

Abstract: To prepare Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6, the starting materials were loaded in the stoichiometric ratio into silica tubes and then heated at 1000K. The reaction products were mixed and divided into four equal parts. The first sample was used as a reference sample called bulk. For the remaining samples, 1%, 2% and 3% by mass of MWCNT (multi-wall carbon nanotubes) were added by ball-milling. These materials were then subjected to consolidation by hot-pressing at 850K and 56MPa. Their transport properties were determined and compared to study the influence of MWCNT on the transport properties of Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the microstructural and nanostructural features of the samples, and Raman characterization was performed to look for changes induced by ball-milling and hot-pressing of the nanotubes. Mainly due to a largely reduced thermal conductivity by 40% and a slightly reduced power factor, the figure-of-merit was improved by 25% after addition of 3mass% of MWCNT.

Introduction:
Energy crisis and thermal management are two of the most hotly debated topics today. Most of our energy comes from fossil fuels which are non-renewable, and technology associated with renewable energy generation such as solar is yet to mature, evolving very slowly. As fossil fuel reserves are limited, it is very important to use these very efficiently.

Conclusion:
Apart from ball-milling, we intend to explore other methods to disperse CNT homogeneously to enhance phonon scattering, while simultaneously preserving electrical conductivity as much as possible by embedding metal nanoparticle coated CNT.

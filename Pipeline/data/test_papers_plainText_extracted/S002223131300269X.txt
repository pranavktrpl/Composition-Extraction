Title: Internal field induced exciton binding energy and the optical transition in a strained Mg based II–VI quantum well

Abstract: Binding energy of an exciton in a wurtzite ZnO/Zn1−x                      Mg                         x                      O strained quantum well is investigated theoretically in which the strong built-in electric field due to the spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations is included. Numerical calculations are performed using variational procedure within the single band effective mass approximation by varying the Mg composition in the barrier. The exciton oscillator strength and the exciton lifetime for radiative recombination as functions of well width and Mg content have been computed. The internal field induced interband emission energy of strained ZnO/Zn1−x                      Mg                         x                      O well is investigated with the various structural parameters. The total optical absorption coefficients and the changes of refractive index as a function of normalized photon energy in the presence of built-in internal field are analyzed. The result shows that the strong built-in electric field has influence on the oscillator strength and the recombination life time of the exciton. The optical absorption coefficients and the refractive index changes strongly depend on Mg composition. The occurred blue shift of the resonant peak due to the incorporation of Mg ions will give the information about the variation of two energy levels in the quantum well.

Results and discussion:
The inset figure shows the variation of radiative life time with the Mg concentration in ZnO⧸ZnMgO quantum well for two different well widths. Higher Mg concentration will lead to higher internal field eventually enhances the radiative life time of exciton. Further, we observe that the increase in Mg concentration enhances the excitonic oscillator strength leading higher internal field eventually enhancing the radiative life time of exciton. When the well width is decreased the overlap of electron and hole wave functions reduces the exciton life time and increases the optical oscillator strength whereas a large internal field (with the Mg composition) again leads to the enhancement of radiative life time of exciton. Thus, the excitonic radiative lifetime is attributed to the alteration of overlap integral.

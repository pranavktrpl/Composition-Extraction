Title: Dielectric properties of lithium niobate–tantalate crystals

Abstract: Dielectric properties, including linear (refractive index) and second-order nonlinear optical responses, of LiNb1−y                      Ta                         y                      O3-type mixed single crystals with y=0.00, 0.81, 0.92, 0.97, and 1.00 have been quantitatively studied. Based on the corresponding crystal compositions, the chemical bond method was applied. The results show that the dielectric susceptibilities at 1.064μm decrease remarkably with increasing tantalum content in the mixed-crystal system lithium niobate–tantalate.

Introduction:
Despite all similarities, there are also specific differences of the physical properties, which make it important to study the mixed system LNT in more detail. Phase matching properties, e.g. for NLO applications like sum frequency generation or optical parametric oscillation could be influenced very sensitively by the composition. To a certain degree, the mixed system yields also a simple crystal modeling method that may lead to good functional materials. As lithium niobate has been much more intensively investigated than lithium tantalate, it is reasonable to use lithium niobate as the starting point in the considerations of the current mixed system.

Title: Application of Cr3C2/C composite powders synthesized via molten-salt method in low-carbon MgO–C refractories

Abstract: High-performance and low-carbon MgO–C refractories are important refractories for smelting ultra-low carbon steel and clean steel. Based on this, Cr3C2/C composite powders were synthesized by the molten-salt method, and used as an additive to prepare low-carbon MgO–C refractories under nitrogen atmosphere. The phase, morphology and oxidation kinetics of Cr3C2/C composite powders were studied. In addition, the effect of Cr3C2/C composite powders on the morphology, mechanical properties, thermal shock resistance, and corrosion resistance of MgO–C refractories was investigated. The results indicated that the Cr3C2/C composite powders exhibited superior oxidation resistance than flake graphite. Moreover, the Cr3C2/C composite powders were introduced into the MgO–C refractories. Compared with the sample without Cr3C2/C composite powders, the introduction of 1 wt% Cr3C2/C composite powders significantly improved the thermomechanical properties and corrosion resistance of the material, its CMOR, CCS before and CCS after thermal shock were 9.06 MPa, 50.40 MPa and 32.60 MPa, respectively, and the corrosion index was significantly reduced from 44.6% to 26.5%.

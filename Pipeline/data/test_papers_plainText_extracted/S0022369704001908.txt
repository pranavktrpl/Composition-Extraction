Title: Study of temperature dependence of density  bulk modulus  shear modulus and thermal pressure for mantle minerals

Abstract: The temperature dependence of different parameters i.e. density ρ(T), bulk modulus K                                               T                      (T), shear modulus G                                               T                      (T) and thermal pressure ΔP                      th for mantle minerals i.e. X2SiO4 (X=Mg, Fe, Co, Mn) have been studied in high temperature range on the basis of semi-phenomenological isobaric equation of state. The calculated values of these parameters are showing good agreements with experimental value in case of each mantle minerals.

Introduction:
The temperature dependent volume and thermal expansivity data of any kind of materials i.e. ionic crystal, earth's interior material, etc. are required for developing the equation of state and predicting the temperature dependence of different parameter like volume, density, bulk modulus and thermal pressure, etc.

Title: Microstructure and mechanical properties of W-reinforced Ti(CN) prepared by spark plasma sintering of premixed Ti(CN)–W powder

Abstract: W-reinforced Ti(CN) with enhanced mechanical properties was prepared by spark plasma sintering of premixed Ti(CN)–W powder. The powder was prepared by milling and subsequent heat treatment of the TiO2–WO3–C mixture. The low affinity between W and C/N enabled the W particles to be embedded in the Ti(CN) matrix during heat–treatment. The uniformly distributed W particles in the Ti(CN) had a role in interrupting the crack propagation and enhancing the fracture toughness (K                      IC: 7.65MPam1/2). The high hardness of W, compared to those of other metals (Ni, Co), hardens the W–Ti(CN) cermet over other conventional Ti(CN)–based cermets (H                      V: 30.8GPa). The mechanical properties of the W–Ti(CN) were comparable to those of B–based superhard cermets. The W–Ti(CN) cermet could have considerable potential for use in structural applications.

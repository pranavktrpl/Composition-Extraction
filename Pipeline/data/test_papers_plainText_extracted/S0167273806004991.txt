Title: Ionic conductivity of brownmillerite-type calcium ferrite under oxidizing conditions

Abstract: The thermogravimetric and Mössbauer spectroscopy studies showed that, at atmospheric oxygen pressure, the oxygen content in Ca2Fe2O5 brownmillerite is very close to stoichiometric at 300–1270 K. The orthorhombic lattice of calcium ferrite undergoes a transition from primitive (space group Pnma) to body-centered (I2mb) at 950–1000 K, which is accompanied with decreasing thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) and increasing activation energy for the total conductivity, predominantly p-type electronic. The steady-state oxygen permeation through dense Ca2Fe2O5 ceramics is limited by the bulk ionic conduction. The ion transference numbers in air vary in the range 0.002–0.007 at 1123–1273 K, increasing with temperature. Analysis of stereological factors, which may affect oxygen diffusivity, suggests a dominant role of the ion jumps along octahedral and, possibly, tetrahedral layers of the brownmillerite structure. The ionic conductivity of calcium ferrite is higher than that of Ca2FeAlO5+δ                      , but lower compared to the oxygen-deficient perovskite phases based on SrFeO3−δ                       where the diffusion pathways form a three-dimensional network. The average TECs of Ca2Fe2O5 ceramics, calculated from dilatometric data in air, are 13.1×10−6 K−1 at 370–950 K and 11.3×10−6 K−1 at 970–1270 K.

Ionic conduction:
In summary, brownmillerite-type calcium ferrite exhibits a moderate thermal expansion and stable oxygen stoichiometry, implying dimensional stability under oxygen chemical potential gradients. These properties might be of interest for practical applications, provided that further compositional optimization is possible in order to increase oxygen-vacancy concentration in the octahedral layers and, thus, to improve ion diffusivity. On the other hand, the number of acceptor-type cations having a substantial solubility in the calcium ferrite lattice is limited. Additional studies are necessary to assess effects of A-site nonstoichiometry and doping in order to optimize the size of ion migration channels. One possible method to enhance the ionic conductivity may refer to texturing of the ceramic material in order to achieve preferential grain orientation.

Title: Influence of milling time on mechanically assisted synthesis of Pb0.91Ca0.1TiO3 powders

Abstract: Pb0.91Ca0.1TiO3 powders (PCT) were prepared by mechanochemical synthesis from high-energy ball milling process. The influence of milling time on the phase formation, crystal structure, specific surface area, density and powder morphology was observed. We adopted the Rietveld refinement technique to investigate the crystal structure of the PCT powders. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed that PCT powders milled for 5h showed a wide distribution of particle agglomerates while milled for 35h showed a decrease in agglomerates size. Further prolongation of milling time resulted in the agglomerates growth.

Introduction:
In this work, PCT powders were successfully synthesized by mechanochemical synthesis in high-energy ball milling. Milling parameters were optimized to reduce milling time. The purpose of this work was to analyze advanced results regarding the effect of milling time on the formation of perovskite structure of PCT material.

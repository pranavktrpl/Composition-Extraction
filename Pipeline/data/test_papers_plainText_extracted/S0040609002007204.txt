Title: Infrared characterisation of evaporated SiO thin films

Abstract: Thin films of SiO deposited on Si substrates by thermal evaporation have been characterised by the analysis of infrared absorption bands and optical constants determination. The structure of the films has been studied in terms of the RBM (Random Bonding Model) and a deviation from the pure RBM structure has been found in the relative concentration of the different tetrahedra SiO                         y                      Si4–y                       (y=1–4) and in the presence of an additional contribution of SiO4 tetrahedra confirmed by the optical properties. Comparative study of films deposited under different conditions and with different thickness suggests that the local arrangement of Si and O atoms, the oxygen content of the films and morphological changes in the films must be considered to account for all the effects observed.

Results and discussion:
Finally, the negligible variation of the absorption band and its components with the deposition rate of the films at 200 °C, cannot account for the clear decrease in refractive index observed as the rate is decreased. Again other effects, as the density of the films, must be considered to explain the behaviour of the optical constants.

Conclusions:
Comparative study of the absorption bands and refractive indices of films deposited at different substrate temperatures and deposition rates and with different thickness has been presented. The results suggest that the local arrangement of Si and O atoms, and the oxygen content of the films may account for some of the behaviours observed, but morphological changes in the films must also be considered to account for all the effects.

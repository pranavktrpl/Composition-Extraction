Keywords Double perovskite  Magnetic materials  Sol-gel preparation  Valence  Magnetic moment    1 Introduction Recently, much interest has been focused on the magnetotransport behavior of the ordered double perovskite Sr2 FeMoO6  (SFMO) because of its high magnetic transition temperature (T c  ∼ 400 K) and pronounced magnetoresistance at room temperature superior to the manganese compounds [1–4] . The electrons of Fe and Mo cations may be considered as localized and itinerant, respectively, with the valence states of Fe3+  (3d5 ;t2g 3 eg 2 , S  = 5/2) and Mo5+  (4d1 ;t2g 1 , S  = 1/2), leading to an ideal saturation magnetization, M s  = 4μ B /f.u. However, in most cases the SFMO presents a reduced Ms  due to antisite defects (ASDs) [5–8] . Furthermore, the 57 Fe Mössbauer spectra and the X-ray absorption spectra for Sr2 FeMoO6  indicate a mixed-valence or valence-fluctuating state for iron [9–13] . Further studies on other members of the A2 BB′O6  family indicate that colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) or tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) could be observed in some of them. It has been reported that ferromagnetism with a T c  up to 458 K has been found in ceramic and thin film samples of Sr2 CrWO6 [14] . More importantly, this compound has been predicted to be half-metallic, which will exhibit the potential application in spintronics devices [15] . However, formation of ordered double perovskites Sr2 MWO6  (M = Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, etc.) often requires annealing at high temperatures (1200–1400 °C) for a long time [14,16–19]  and further recycling annealing. Inevitably, some minor impurities exist in these double perovskites. Thus, it is necessary to develop another synthetic route to get high quality ordered double perovskites in relatively mild conditions. Herein, Sr2 MWO6  (M = Co, Ni) has been synthesized using sol-gel method. We present results of X-ray powder diffraction and bulk magnetization measurements. The Morphology of Sr2 MWO6  (M = Co, Ni) was also investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  2 Experimental Sr2 MWO6  (M = Co, Ni) were prepared in polycrystalline form by sol-gel method using citric acid as a complexant. Stoichiometric amounts of analytical grade Sr(NO3 )2 , Ni(NO3 )2 ·6H2 O, Co(NO3 )3 ·6H2 O, 5(NH4 )2 O·12WO3 ·5H2 O were dissolved in water, then appropriate amount of citric acid and ethylene glycol were added. Each solution was slowly evaporated at 60–70 °C and finally a gel formed. The gel was dried at 120 °C and then was heated at high temperatures up to 600 °C. All the organic materials and nitrates were eliminated in a subsequent treatment at 700 °C in air for 5 h. This treatment gave rise to highly reactive precursor powder. The obtained powder was pressed into small pellets and a final heat treatment was at 1200 °C for 20 h in air. The X-ray diffraction measurement (XRD) was performed using a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The magnetization was measured in zero field at 1 T on an Oxford MagLab equipment, in the range 5 K to 300 K. The morphology of grains was characterized by a JE01 JXA-840 scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The elements valences were investigated by an ESCALABMKII X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).  3 Results and discussion The XRD patterns in Fig. 1   show single-phase structure for Sr2 MWO6  (M = Co, Ni) without traces of impurities, especially no SrWO4 , which inevitably formed in many solid state reaction routes and even in some chemical wet routes. Superstructure reflections can be clearly seen around 19° and 38°, corresponding to the B sites Ni/W and Co/W ordering. Generally, the starting metal ions are mixed at an atomic scale in sol-gel approach and a homogeneous reaction system was obtained. So we can exploit relatively short reaction time and low temperature to get high quality single-phase double perovskites. Structural analysis was performed using CELL program. The crystal structures of both samples belong to the tetragonal I  4/m  space group. In fact, Philipp et al. [14]  has formulated the following empirical rule: For 0.96 ≲ t  ≲ 1.06 in the majority of cases the double perovskites are cubic/tetragonal. For t  ≲ 0.96, orthorhombic/monoclinic structures are favored, whereas for 1.06 ≲ t  a hexagonal structure is preferred. The definition of t  is given byt = r A  + r O   2  ( r B  + r O  )    .    Here, <r B > means the average ionic radius for the ions on the B site. The values of t  for Sr2 CoWO6  and Sr2 NiWO6  are about 0.97 and 0.98, respectively, suited to this empirical rule. The cell parameters are calculated as follows: a  = b  = 5.5858(4) Å, c  = 7.9773(3) Å for Sr2 CoWO6  and a  = b  = 5.5586(5) Å, c  = 7.8993(7) Å for Sr2 NiWO6 . Our results are comparable with the previous reports [19–23] . SEM images for Sr2 MWO6  (M = Co, Ni) are shown in Fig. 2  , the average grain size is about 1.5 μm and 0.5 μm for Sr2 CoWO6  and Sr2 NiWO6 , respectively. Energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX) showed the molar ratios of chemical compositions are very close to the theoretical values, about 2.00 : 1.03 : 1.00 for Sr/Co/W in Sr2 CoWO6  and 2.00 : 1.02 : 0.99 for Sr/Ni/W in Sr2 NiWO6 , although the grain size of Sr2 CoWO6  is bigger than that of Sr2 NiWO6 , however, there are more pores in Sr2 CoWO6  sample. The grain size of Sr2 CoWO6  is bigger than that of Sr2 NiWO6 , which disobeys the rule that relatively large ionic radius does not benefit to the diffusion in the solid state reaction. The deep reason is still unclear and more detailed work need to be done further. From the morphologies of both samples, the grains seem to be homogeneous and connect each other well. This means that the grain boundary effect is not significant in our polycrystalline samples, which will facilitate to characterize the bulk properties instead of single crystal. Fig. 3   shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for Sr2 MWO6  (M = Co, Ni). Paramagnetic moments and Weiss temperatures (Table 1  ) were determined from a simple Curie–Weiss law, χ  = C  / (T  − θ ), in the range 160 < T  < 300 K. The negative Weiss temperature indicates that the predominant magnetic interactions in Sr2 MWO6  (M = Co, Ni) are antiferromagnetic. The Neel temperature (T N ) for Sr2 CoWO6  is 23 K, similar to other group's results [20] . While T N  for Sr2 NiWO6  is 59 K, a little higher than the previous reports [21] . An effective paramagnetic moment μ eff  of 2.87 is obtained for Sr2 NiWO6 , which is almost equal to that of only the spin value for Ni2+  (3d8 ), 2.82 [21] . That means W does not contribute to the moment, indicating the lack of local moment at W sites. Therefore, the configurations of Ni and W should be Ni2+  (3d8 ) and W6+  (5d0 ), respectively. Interestingly, an effective paramagnetic moment μ eff  of 3.02 is obtained for Sr2 CoWO6 , smaller than μ cal  of high-spin (H.S.) Co2+  (S  = 3/2) and the calculated result by Viola and coworkers [20]  (3.87 and 5.20 μ B , respectively). According to the work of Balcells' group [8] , (101) is a superstructure line which reflects the ordering of B/B′ ions. Roughly estimated from their work, the ASD in our Sr2 CoWO6  sample is not more than 5% (in Viola et al. [20] , it is 4.7%). In other words, the antisite in these kinds of double perovskite also influence the sample's properties but could not play the most important role. So the rapid decrement of magnetic effective moment, from 5.2 μ B  to 3.02, cannot mainly be ascribed to antisite disorder. Possibly, our low μ eff  value is due to the external magnetic field. Here, it is 1 T, much larger than that in Viola's work [20] . So the high external field may benefit the superexchange interactions between Co ions and increases the magnetic ordering, which is responsible for the quenching of the orbital contribution. Our experimental result is very close to the expected spin-only saturation moment for high spin Co2+  (3 μB ). In such a way that the magnetic moment contribution of Sr2 CoWO6  in our temperature range is mainly from the spin of Co ions. In order to determine the valence state and analyze the configuration of Co and W further, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements have also been exploited. The Co 2p3/2  XPS spectrum shows a main peak at around 782.0 eV, which is most similar to that of Co(OH)2  and far away from that of Co2 O3 , whose main peaks are located at around 782.1 and 781.3 eV [24] , respectively. Therefore, the valence state of Co in Sr2 CoWO6  is ascribed to be 2+ . Moreover, we compare the W4f7/2  XPS spectrum with some other tungsten compound, for instance, WO3 . The main peak of W4f7/2  in Sr2 CoWO6  is located at 35.8 eV, close to the peaks in WO3 , 35.4 and 35.7 eV, respectively [25,26] . Based on the above data, we believe the ions in Sr2 CoWO6  comprise Co2+  and W6+  ions.  4 Conclusions A sol-gel method was successfully exploited to synthesize ordered double perovskite Sr2 MWO6  (M = Co, Ni). The wet-chemical route favors to achieve a high quality product without traces of impurities under mild condition. We confirmed the configuration of Ni and Co should be Ni2+  (3d8 ) and Co2+  (3d7 ), respectively. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the magnetic moment in these double perovskites originates mainly from the interaction between Ni ions and Co ions while W does not contribute to the moment.

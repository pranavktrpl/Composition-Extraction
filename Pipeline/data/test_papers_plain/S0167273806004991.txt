                  The thermogravimetric and Mössbauer spectroscopy studies showed that, at atmospheric oxygen pressure, the oxygen content in Ca2Fe2O5 brownmillerite is very close to stoichiometric at 300–1270 K. The orthorhombic lattice of calcium ferrite undergoes a transition from primitive (space group Pnma) to body-centered (I2mb) at 950–1000 K, which is accompanied with decreasing thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) and increasing activation energy for the total conductivity, predominantly p-type electronic. The steady-state oxygen permeation through dense Ca2Fe2O5 ceramics is limited by the bulk ionic conduction. The ion transference numbers in air vary in the range 0.002–0.007 at 1123–1273 K, increasing with temperature. Analysis of stereological factors, which may affect oxygen diffusivity, suggests a dominant role of the ion jumps along octahedral and, possibly, tetrahedral layers of the brownmillerite structure. The ionic conductivity of calcium ferrite is higher than that of Ca2FeAlO5+δ
                     , but lower compared to the oxygen-deficient perovskite phases based on SrFeO3−δ
                      where the diffusion pathways form a three-dimensional network. The average TECs of Ca2Fe2O5 ceramics, calculated from dilatometric data in air, are 13.1×10−6 K−1 at 370–950 K and 11.3×10−6 K−1 at 970–1270 K.

The thermogravimetric and Mössbauer spectroscopy studies showed that, at atmospheric oxygen pressure, the oxygen content in Ca2 Fe2 O5  brownmillerite is very close to stoichiometric at 300–1270 K. The orthorhombic lattice of calcium ferrite undergoes a transition from primitive (space group Pnma ) to body-centered (I2mb ) at 950–1000 K, which is accompanied with decreasing thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) and increasing activation energy for the total conductivity, predominantly p-type electronic. The steady-state oxygen permeation through dense Ca2 Fe2 O5  ceramics is limited by the bulk ionic conduction. The ion transference numbers in air vary in the range 0.002–0.007 at 1123–1273 K, increasing with temperature. Analysis of stereological factors, which may affect oxygen diffusivity, suggests a dominant role of the ion jumps along octahedral and, possibly, tetrahedral layers of the brownmillerite structure. The ionic conductivity of calcium ferrite is higher than that of Ca2 FeAlO5+δ  , but lower compared to the oxygen-deficient perovskite phases based on SrFeO3−δ   where the diffusion pathways form a three-dimensional network. The average TECs of Ca2 Fe2 O5  ceramics, calculated from dilatometric data in air, are 13.1 × 10− 6  K− 1  at 370–950 K and 11.3 × 10− 6  K− 1  at 970–1270 K.   Keywords Calcium ferrite  Oxygen ionic conductivity  Oxygen permeability  Mössbauer spectroscopy  Thermal expansion  Oxygen nonstoichiometry  Ceramic membranes    1 Introduction Mixed-conducting oxide materials have promising applications in high-temperature electrochemical devices, such as ceramic membranes for oxygen separation and partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and sensors [1–4] . A high level of oxygen ionic conduction is characteristic of perovskite-type ferrites derived from AFeO3−δ  , where A corresponds to the alkaline-earth cations [5–7] . However, these phases exhibit also serious disadvantages including thermodynamic instability under large oxygen chemical potential gradients, poor thermomechanical properties associated with very high chemical and thermal expansion, and reactivity with CO2  and steam. One promising approach to enhance the materials stability refers to the substitution of iron with cations having a more stable oxidation state, such as Al, Ga, Cr, Ti or Zr [5–11] . At the same time, doping with higher-valence cations leads to decreasing ionic conductivity. The incorporation of Al3+  and Ga3+  suppresses oxygen nonstoichiometry variations with temperature and oxygen partial pressure, thus lowering thermal and chemically induced lattice expansion [7–10] . The latter type of doping increases, however, tendency to form vacancy-ordered brownmillerite-like phases at δ  values close to 0.4–0.5 [10,12] . Stability of ferrite-based materials in CO2 - and H2 O-containing atmospheres may be improved by decreasing the A-site cation radius, e.g. by substitution of Sr with Ca, which makes reaction products less thermodynamically stable [13] . Again, this promotes ordering in the oxygen sublattice and brownmillerite formation [7] . The lattice of brownmillerite-type Ca2 Fe2 O5 [14]  consists of alternating perovskite layers of corner-sharing FeO6  octahedra and layers of FeO4  tetrahedra, Fig. 1  . This structure is often considered as an oxygen-deficient perovskite where the oxygen vacancies ordered along (010) planes contribute to ionic conductivity, forming one-dimensional diffusion pathway for oxygen ion migration in the tetrahedral layers [10,15] . Possible charge-carrier generation mechanisms in these channels may involve thermally induced Frenkel- or Schottky-type disordering, with oxygen-vacancy formation in the octahedral sheets, or the incorporation of hyperstoichiometric oxygen [15,16] . On the other hand, atomistic simulations of brownmillerite-type Sr2 Fe2 O5  showed that the ion migration energy in the tetrahedral layers is considerably higher compared to octahedral [16] . This suggests that the role of the former defect reactions in ionic conduction processes should increase with temperature. When the disorder level at elevated temperatures becomes critical, numerous brownmillerite-like phases exhibit a dramatic increase of ionic transport, followed by transition into the perovskite polymorphs [17,18] . The present work was focused on the studies of ionic conductivity, oxygen nonstoichiometry and thermal expansion of Ca2 Fe2 O5  brownmillerite under oxidizing conditions.  2 Experimental The submicron powder of Ca2 Fe2 O5  was prepared by glycine-nitrate process (GNP), a self-combustion route using nitrates of the metal components as oxidant and glycine as fuel and chelating agent [19] . In the course of synthesis, the stoichiometric amounts of high-purity Ca(NO3 )2  and Fe(NO3 )3 ·9H2 O were dissolved in distilled water with subsequent addition of glycine (molar glycine/nitrate ratio of 2); the glycine amount was calculated assuming that N2 , CO2  and H2 O are the only gaseous products of reaction. The solution was heated on a hot plate until self-ignition; the resultant powder having a foam-like structure was annealed at 1073 K for 4 h in order to remove organic residuals. Gas-tight ceramic samples with density higher than 93% were pressed at 150–200 MPa and sintered in air at 1423 ± 5 K for 5 h. Prior to further characterization, the samples were annealed in air at 1173 K for 2 h with subsequent slow cooling (2 K/min) in order to achieve equilibrium oxygen content at low temperatures. The powdered samples necessary for X-ray diffraction (XRD), Mössbauer spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were obtained by grinding of sintered ceramics. To evaluate state of iron cations at 1223 K by the Mössbauer spectroscopy, a series of samples were equilibrated with atmospheric oxygen at 1223 K for 5–6 h and then quenched in liquid nitrogen. XRD patterns were collected at 300–1173 K in air using Rigaku Geigerflex D/MAX-B and Philips X'pert diffractometers (CuKα -radiation, 2θ  range 10° to 100°, step 0.02°, 2–10 s/step). The structural parameters, including positional, thermal, occupancy, Bragg-peak profile parameters, scaling factor, zero shift and background function, were refined using the Fullprof program [20] . Mössbauer spectra were collected at room temperature in transmission mode using a conventional constant-acceleration spectrometer and a 25 mCi 57 Co source in a Rh matrix; the velocity scale was calibrated using α-Fe foil. The absorbers were obtained by pressing the powdered samples (5 mg of natural Fe/cm2 ) into perspex holders. For all data presented in this work, the isomer shifts (IS) are given relative to metallic α-Fe at room temperature. The spectra were fitted to Lorentzian lines using a non-linear least-squares method [21] . TGA was carried out using a Setaram SetSys 16/18 instrument (flowing dry air, heating/cooling rate of 2–3 K/min, dwells for 2 h in the range 973–1373 K with 50 K step). The experiments were repeated for three samples; the difference in the oxygen nonstoichiometry values did not exceed 0.003 oxygen atoms per formula unit. In order to determine absolute oxygen content, Ca2 Fe2 O5  was reduced in flowing 10% H2 –90% N2  gas mixture at 1373–1423 K (Fig. 2  ) into calcium oxide and metallic iron. Thermal expansion of Ca2 Fe2 O5  ceramics was studied by an alumina Linseis L75 dilatometer in flowing air (heating/cooling rate of 2 K/min). Characterization of Ca2 Fe2 O5  ceramics included also the scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), and measurements of total conductivity (4-probe DC), Seebeck coefficient and steady-state oxygen permeability; experimental techniques and equipment were described elsewhere ([7–9,12,18]  and references cited). For all oxygen-permeation data presented in this work, the membrane feed-side oxygen partial pressure (p 2 ) corresponds to atmospheric air (0.21 atm).  3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure and thermal expansion The crystal structure of Ca2 Fe2 O5  equilibrated with atmospheric oxygen at room temperature was identified as an orthorhombic brownmillerite (space group Pnma , No. 62), in agreement with literature data [22] . The refinement results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2   ; the final Rietveld plot is presented in Fig. 3  . The unit cell volume of Ca2 Fe2 O5  (Table 1 ) is larger than that of Ca2 FeAlO5 [23]  due to the larger radius of Fe3+  compared to Al3+ [24] . No changes in the lattice symmetry were revealed on heating up to 873 K. In the XRD pattern collected at 1073 K, the (131) and (151) reflections are absent, indicating transition into a body-centered lattice. Following Redhammer et al. [22]  who observed this phase transformation at approximately 1000 K, the patterns at 1073–1173 K were refined with space group I2mb  (No. 46). Note that the difference of these polymorph modifications of Ca2 Fe2 O5  relates to the arrangement of tetrahedral layers [14] . Namely, at low temperatures, the FeO4  tetrahedra alternate their orientation along the b -axis (Fig. 1 ); on heating their orientation becomes similar in all layers. Another necessary comment is that increasing temperature leads to a substantially lower bond-length distortion for all metal-oxygen polyhedra (Table 2 ). The temperature dependences of the unit cell parameters and volume (Fig. 4  ) exhibit a non-linearity at 950–1000 K, confirming phase transition. In all studied temperature range, the lattice expansion is maximum along the b -axis perpendicular to octahedral and tetrahedral layers. Such a behavior is typical for perovskite-related layered ferrites, such as Sr4 Fe6 O13 [26] . Table 3   compares the thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) calculated from the high-temperature XRD and dilatometric results. As for the lattice parameters, the dilatometric curve of Ca2 Fe2 O5  ceramics is essentially linear, but changes the slope at 955–975 K (Fig. 5  ). The average linear TECs (α¯ ) of calcium ferrite ceramics are 13.1 × 10− 6  and 11.3 × 10− 6  K− 1  in the low- and high-temperature ranges, respectively. These values are close to the estimates which can be obtained from the XRD data as β /3, where β  is the volume TEC.  3.2 Oxygen stoichiometry The Mössbauer spectrum of Ca2 Fe2 O5  equilibrated in air at room temperature (Fig. 6  ) consists of two magnetic splittings, in agreement with Yo et al. [27] . A very similar spectrum was obtained for the sample quenched after annealing at 1223 K; the refined hyperfine parameters are equal within the limits of experimental error (Table 4  ) and are consistent with literature [27,28] . Only the signals of trivalent iron cations in octahedral and tetrahedral coordination can be extracted from these spectra. Considering that amounts of Fe4+  as low as 4% could be detected in Ca2 FeAlO5+δ   spectra [29]  which are similar to the Ca2 Fe2 O5  ones, the present results demonstrate that the oxygen content in Ca2 Fe2 O5±δ   at atmospheric oxygen pressure is very close to nominal; the nonstoichiometry (δ ) cannot be higher than ± 0.02. Indeed, only a minor oxygen deficiency was revealed by TGA, which shows an essentially temperature-independent oxygen content (Fig. 7  ). The observed weight changes on heating are much lower compared to perovskite-type ferrites such as SrFe0.9 Al0.1 O3−δ  [12] , but exhibit a relatively good reproducibility. The calculated oxygen nonstoichiometry values are as low as 0.012 and 0.016 at 300 and 1223 K, respectively (Fig. 5 ). This level of oxygen deficiency is comparable to possible experimental uncertainties, which might result, in particular, from incomplete reduction of iron at 1423 K or from minor compositional inhomogeneities at the grain boundaries. On the other hand, the weight of reduced samples in H2 -containing atmosphere at 1373–1423 K was time-independent (Fig. 2 ); no essential deviations from the nominal cation composition were detected by EDS analysis. Therefore, in contrast to Ca2 FeAlO5+δ   tending to a small hyperstoichiometry under oxidizing conditions [23,29] , the oxygen content in calcium ferrite is almost stoichiometric. Such difference in behavior may originate from a greater disorder in Ca2 FeAlO5+δ   due to non-equilibrium distribution of the B-site cations between the tetrahedral and octahedral sublattices. Taking into account the cation radii [24] , the tetrahedral sublattice in an ideal brownmillerite structure of Ca2 FeAlO5  should be occupied by aluminum. However, as the cation distribution is established at elevated temperatures necessary for synthesis and ceramics sintering, a partially disordered lattice may then be frozen due to stagnated cation diffusion below 1200–1300 K; the experimental Al/Fe ratio in the tetrahedral sites is approximately 4:1 [23] . This may promote partial disordering in the oxygen sublattice. On the contrary, all key processes of the point-defect formation in Ca2 Fe2 O5  are associated with electronic and oxygen-ionic transfer.  3.3 Electrical conductivity and oxygen permeability The total conductivity of Ca2 Fe2 O5  (Fig. 8  ) is predominantly electronic. The ion transference numbers (t O ), calculated from the oxygen-permeation data discussed below, vary in the range 0.0018–0.0055 at 1123–1248 K (Table 5  ). Under oxidizing conditions, the Seebeck coefficient has positive values, thus indicating that the mobile electronic charge carriers are p -type, as for other perovskite-related ferrites [7,9,12,18] . The conductivity of calcium ferrite is substantially higher than that of Ca2 FeAlO5+δ   where 50% iron sites are occupied by insulating Al3+  cations. Also, preferable Al3+  location in the tetrahedral layers [23]  may lead to essentially two-dimensional character of the electronic transport in Ca2 FeAlO5+δ  . In the vicinity of the phase transition at 950–1000 K, both brownmillerite compounds exhibit an increase in the activation energy (E a ) for total conductivity. The E a  values of Ca2 Fe2 O5 , 27 kJ/mol at 370–960 K and 40 kJ/mol at 960–1280 K (Table 5 ) are typical for a small-polaron mechanism. The steady-state oxygen-permeation fluxes (j ) through Ca2 Fe2 O5  membranes of various thickness are presented in Fig. 9 A . The specific oxygen permeability J (O2 ), used to identify the permeation-limiting factors, was calculated as [7,9] (1) j = J ( O 2  )  d  · ln ( p 2   p 1    )     where d  is the membrane thickness and p 1  is the permeate-side oxygen pressure. The corresponding J (O2 ) values are compared in Fig. 9 B. As the specific oxygen permeability is proportional to j  × d  by definition, this quantity should be thickness-independent if the overall oxygen transport is only limited by the bulk ambipolar conductivity. When permeation is affected by surface-exchange kinetics, J (O2 ) should increase with increasing d due to a decreasing role of the surface processes. In the case of Ca2 Fe2 O5 , the oxygen fluxes decrease with increasing membrane thickness, while the difference in J (O2 ) values is negligible within the limits of experimental error (Fig. 9 ). This indicates that the permeation is determined by the ambipolar conductivity (σ amb ), averaged for a given oxygen pressure range:(2) J ( O 2  ) = R T  16 F 2    σ amb   ―  = R T  16 F 2    σ e  σ O   ―  σ e  + σ O    = R T  16 F 2    ( 1 − t O  ) t O  σ  ―     where σ , σ O  and σ e  are the total and partial ionic and electronic conductivities, respectively. Eq. (2)  makes it possible to calculate ionic contribution to the total conductivity at oxygen partial pressures close to atmospheric, when p 1 →p 2 . Notice that the negligible influence of oxygen surface exchange, found also for Ca2 FeAlO5+δ  [23] , is common for various ferrite-based materials with relatively low ionic transport, such as Sr4 Fe6 O13±δ  [26]  and Gd3 Fe5 O12±δ  [30] .  3.4 Ionic conduction The oxygen ionic conductivity of Ca2 Fe2 O5  brownmillerite is considerably higher than that of CaAl0.5 Fe0.5 O2.5  (Fig. 10  ). Similar phenomena are well known for Al-containing ferrites having the perovskite-type structure (e.g. [9,12] ) and reflect greater Al–O bond energy with respect to Fe–O bonds. The level of ionic transport in calcium ferrite is, however, 10–30 times lower if compared to the cubic ferrite-based perovskites with a high oxygen deficiency, such as SrFe(Al)O3−δ   or Sr(La)Fe(Ga)O3−δ  [31,32] . One critical factor responsible for such behavior is the low concentration of oxygen vacancies in the octahedral layers of Ca2 Fe2 O5  (Fig. 5 ). In these conditions, an important impact may be expected from the Frenkel-type disorder resulting in the formation of extra oxygen ions in tetrahedral sheets and vacancies in the iron–oxygen octahedra; the Schottky-like reactions [16]  require cation diffusion impeded in dense ceramic materials. Whatever the microscopic mechanisms, the E a  for ionic conduction, 147 ± 5 kJ/mol (Table 5 ), should include not only the ion-migration contribution, but also the energy for the defect formation. At the same time, this E a  value is quite close to the ionic transport activation energies in SrFe(Al)O3−δ   or Sr(La)Fe(Ga)O3−δ  , where a significant part of oxygen vacancies is trapped in ordered microdomains and defect clusters [12,32] . As the migration energy in tetrahedral layers of the brownmillerite structure is substantially higher than in octahedral [16] , such behavior indicates that the energetic effects relevant for the mobile vacancy formation in perovskite blocks of Ca2 Fe2 O5  lattice are similar to those in perovskite-like ferrites. The relatively low level of ionic conductivity in calcium ferrite suggests, hence, an importance of stereological constraints. In theory, ion diffusion may be affected by a number of structural parameters, primarily the lattice free volume and the size of channels available for mobile oxygen anions [33–35] . The specific free volume (V SF ) is defined as (V  − V ion ) / V [35] , where V  is the unit cell volume and V ion  is its fraction occupied by ions. The V SF  value of Ca2 Fe2 O5  (0.433) is, indeed, higher than that of Ca2 FeAlO5  (0.410). However, these volumes are both smaller than those in ferrite garnets, where the ionic conduction is lower by 5–10 times [30] . Hence, the concept of free volume as transport-determining factor [34,35] , developed for perovskite-type oxides, may hardly be applied for comparison of phases with different structural types. A deeper insight into the ionic conduction mechanisms can be provided analyzing particular lattice elements where the ion migration may take place. Table 6   compares the radii of ion migration channels (so-called “bottlenecks”), the corresponding jump distances and the angles showing curvature of different diffusion pathways, all estimated from the Rietvield refinement results. The saddle-point critical radius (r ) was calculated considering the largest circle that may be placed between two Ca2+  and one Fe3+  cations [33] ; the curvature of a jump trajectory via this saddle point is expressed by the α  angle, as illustrated in Fig. 11  . Another angle (γ ) corresponds to two consecutive elementary jumps via given oxygen sites. The critical radii of largest ion-migration channels in Ca2 Fe2 O5  lattice are similar to those in perovskite-type ferrites, such as Sr(La)Fe(Ga)O3−δ  [32] . However, the O2–O3 bonds form extremely distorted diffusion pathways; as a result, ionic transport along the b -axis of the brownmillerite structure is unlikely. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 12  , where possible jumps between each pair of oxygen positions are shown by arrows starting from the corresponding site; the arrow length is proportional to r  × ∣cos(α )∣. The maximum jump probability can be expected for the ion jumps along the octahedral and, possibly, tetrahedral layers. The latter pathway is, however, very non-linear. In summary, brownmillerite-type calcium ferrite exhibits a moderate thermal expansion and stable oxygen stoichiometry, implying dimensional stability under oxygen chemical potential gradients. These properties might be of interest for practical applications, provided that further compositional optimization is possible in order to increase oxygen-vacancy concentration in the octahedral layers and, thus, to improve ion diffusivity. On the other hand, the number of acceptor-type cations having a substantial solubility in the calcium ferrite lattice is limited. Additional studies are necessary to assess effects of A-site nonstoichiometry and doping in order to optimize the size of ion migration channels. One possible method to enhance the ionic conductivity may refer to texturing of the ceramic material in order to achieve preferential grain orientation.   4 Conclusions The electronic and oxygen-ionic transport properties, oxygen stoichiometry and thermal expansion of brownmillerite-type Ca2 Fe2 O5  were studied in the temperature range 300 to 1270 K under oxidizing conditions. The orthorhombic lattice of calcium ferrite undergoes transition from primitive (space group Pnma ) to body-centered (S.G. I2mb ) at 950–1000 K. This leads to decreasing thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) and increasing activation energy for the total conductivity, predominantly p-type electronic. The steady-state oxygen permeation through dense Ca2 Fe2 O5  ceramics at 1123–1273 K is determined by the bulk ionic conduction. The ion transference numbers in air vary in the range 0.002–0.007, increasing with temperature. The activation energy for ionic transport, 147 kJ/mol, is slightly higher compared to highly deficient ferrites with cubic perovskite lattice, but lower with respect to Ca2 FeAlO5  brownmillerite. In contrast to the latter compound, Ca2 Fe2 O5−δ   is almost stoichiometric at atmospheric oxygen pressure (δ  < 0.02). The nature of minor oxygen deficiency revealed by TGA requires, however, further investigations. Analysis of the structural factors influencing ionic transport suggests a dominant role of ion migration in the octahedral and, to a lesser extent, tetrahedral layers; the diffusion along b -axis of the brownmillerite lattice is very unlikely. These constraints, and the low concentration of oxygen vacancies in the perovskite-like layers, result in a relatively low ionic conductivity, 2 × 10− 3  S/cm at 1173 K. The average TECs of Ca2 Fe2 O5  ceramics, calculated from the high-temperature XRD and dilatometric data, are in the range (11.3–13.6) × 10− 6  K− 1 .

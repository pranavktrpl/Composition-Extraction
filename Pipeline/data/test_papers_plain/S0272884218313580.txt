                  TiB2–20vol%B4C (TB20) and TiB2–80vol%B4C (TB80) ceramic cutting tool materials were prepared by hot pressing, and then tested in turning of Ti6Al4V alloy with various cutting parameters. The tool life and wear mechanism of TB20 and TB80 were studied and compared with a commercial grade tungsten carbide tool (WO). The results of turning showed that effective cutting length of TB20 was about one third longer than that of TB80 and WO. Among the three tools, the increment of cutting temperature measured for TB20 was the lowest as flank wear increased from 0 to 600 µm. Analysis showed that dominant wear mechanism was adhesive wear in all of the three tools tested, while chipping was also observed in TB80 and temperature deterioration in WO. In addition, the TB20 exhibited a much better integrity of cutting edge after flank wear reaching 600 µm, due to its higher toughness than TB80 and higher thermal resistance than WO, respectively. The adhesive layers of work-piece material on the rake and flank faces of both TB20 and TB80 were much thinner than that of WO, which suggested a lower adhesive wear rate in TiB2-B4C cutting tools. The high wear resistance of TiB2-B4C cutting tools is attributed to higher thermal resistance, higher hardness, and lower chemical affinity with titanium as compared with tungsten carbides, which makes them very promising materials for high speed machining of titanium alloys.

TiB2 –20vol%B4 C (TB20) and TiB2 –80vol%B4 C (TB80) ceramic cutting tool materials were prepared by hot pressing, and then tested in turning of Ti6Al4V alloy with various cutting parameters. The tool life and wear mechanism of TB20 and TB80 were studied and compared with a commercial grade tungsten carbide tool (WO). The results of turning showed that effective cutting length of TB20 was about one third longer than that of TB80 and WO. Among the three tools, the increment of cutting temperature measured for TB20 was the lowest as flank wear increased from 0 to 600 µm. Analysis showed that dominant wear mechanism was adhesive wear in all of the three tools tested, while chipping was also observed in TB80 and temperature deterioration in WO. In addition, the TB20 exhibited a much better integrity of cutting edge after flank wear reaching 600 µm, due to its higher toughness than TB80 and higher thermal resistance than WO, respectively. The adhesive layers of work-piece material on the rake and flank faces of both TB20 and TB80 were much thinner than that of WO, which suggested a lower adhesive wear rate in TiB2 -B4 C cutting tools. The high wear resistance of TiB2 -B4 C cutting tools is attributed to higher thermal resistance, higher hardness, and lower chemical affinity with titanium as compared with tungsten carbides, which makes them very promising materials for high speed machining of titanium alloys.   Keywords TiB2 -B4 C ceramic  High speed cutting  Tool life  Wear mechanism  Ti6Al4V    1 Introduction High speed precision machining has been developed with several advantages such as high removal rates, low cutting forces, excellent dimensional accuracy [1] , and surface finishing quality as well as surface integrity [2] . Titanium alloy is one of the most difficult-to-cut materials that only allows very low cutting speed to achieve adequate dimensional tolerance and surface finish in traditional cutting process. In cutting of Ti6Al4V alloys, the cutting force decreased with the increase in cutting speed because of the occurrence of conflicting work hardening–thermal softening processes with the deformation phase of the chip segment [3] . The cutting temperature would increase slightly as the cutting speed increased [4] , but would increase dramatically with increasing flank wear of the cutting tools [5] . Tungsten carbide is one of the most commonly used tools for machining titanium alloys, but with increasing cutting speed, its tool life would drop rapidly due to severely unpredicted tool wear [6] . Wear mechanism of uncoated cemented carbides included adhesive wear, crater wear [7] , and diffusion that would gradually become dominant as cutting speed and attrition increased [8] . Tool life of uncoated carbides would decrease to less than 2 min when cutting speed reaches 150 m/min in cutting of Ti6Al4V [9] . In order to increase cutting speed and efficiency, and improve surface finish quality, tungsten carbides with various coatings have been developed. One of them was boride coatings with high hardness and excellent thermal conductivity. In turning of Ti6Al4V, Cherukuri and Molian [10]  demonstrated that AlMgB14 –20%TiB2  coated carbide inserts exhibited two times longer lifetime in flank and nose wears than uncoated carbide inserts at cutting speed of 61 m/min. Corduan [11]  also showed that TiB2  monolayer could be used in cutting of Ti6Al4V without problems of adhesion in relative low cutting speed. On the other hand, researchers have manufactured TiB2 -based ceramic cutting tools for interest of its high hardness, high strength, high melting point, high fracture toughness, and high wear resistance [12,13] . Therefore, TiB2  based bulk cutting tools are considered to be excellent cutting tool candidate to machine high strength metals such as titanium and nickel-based alloy. However, the cutting performance of TiB2 -based ceramic cutting tools has been rarely studied and reported, especially in titanium alloys, in open literatures. The cutting performance of TiB2 -B4 C ceramic cutting tools in high speed turning of Ti6Al4V alloy was evaluated in the present study. The objective of this study was to provide insight into the relationship between tool life and wear mechanisms, which could in turn offer fundamental guide lines to optimize the TiB2 -based ceramic cutting tools for high speed machining of difficult-to-cut materials.  2 Experimental procedures TiB2 -B4 C composite materials were prepared from TiB2  (99.5% in purity, mean size 5 µm) and B4 C (99% in purity, mean size 3 µm) powders. The composites of TB20 and TB80 with 20 and 80 vol% B4 C powders, respectively, as shown in  Table 1 ,were mixed for 24 h in a polyethylene jar using ethyl alcohol and Si3 N4  balls, and dried in rotary evaporator. The dried powder mixtures were hot-pressed in graphite element resistance furnace at 2000 °C for 60 min under 30 MPa in 1 atm Ar atmosphere. The bulk density of the sintered composites was measured using Archimedes principle in distilled water. Microstructure of the metallographic samples were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova NanoSEM430, FEI, The Netherlands), equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer analysis system (EDS) for compositional analysis. Vickers hardness was measured by the indentation method using a load of 24.5 N for 10 s on a polished surface. Fracture toughness was determined using both indentation method and single-edge notched beam (SENB) test. Fracture toughness measured by indentation method was using a Vickers indenter with an indentation load of 98 N according to the equation proposed by Anstis [14] . Fracture toughness measured by SENB test was using rectangular (25 mm × 5 mm × 2.5 mm) bars with 2.5 mm notched depth and 0.2 mm notched width, with span width of 20 mm and a crosshead displacement of 0.05 mm/min. The flexural strength was measured in a four-point bending test fixture with an inter span width of 10 mm and an outer span width of 20 mm, and a crosshead displacement of 0.5 mm/min on rectangular (25 mm × 2 mm × 1.5 mm) bars at room temperature. The prepared TiB2 -B4 C materials were processed into standard cutting tools of ISO SNGN120408 (12.7 mm × 12.7 mm, 4.76 mm thickness, 0.8 mm nose radius) [15] . In addition, all inserts have a chamfered edge of 0.2 mm long with a 20° normal rake. A commercially available cobalt cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co) cutting tool, named as WO, (Zhuzhou Cemented Carbide Cutting Tools co., LTD, China) with the same geometry was also acquired for experimental comparison with TiB2 -B4 C cutting tools. Only hardness and indentation toughness of WO were measured because of the limited geometry size of the tool pieces. Cutting tests were carried out on a NC (Numerical Control) lathe system (ETC3650h, China) equipped with a commercial tool holder having the geometry: rake angle γ o  = −6°, clearance angle α o  = 6°, inclination angle λ s  = −6°, side cutting edge angle K r  = 45°. A 100-mm-diameter cylinder Ti6Al4V alloy in the as-forged condition were used for the cutting tool evaluation (Baoti group co., LTD). Hardness of the Ti6Al4V alloy was determined as 3.83 ± 0.03 GPa (about 40.5HRC) by indentation method with indentation load of 9.8 N for 10 s. The tool rejection and failure criteria for the experiments were the localized flank wear (VB ) > 0.6 mm and excessive chipping, flaking and/or fracturing of the cutting edge. Cutting conditions employed in this study are: cutting speeds V c  in the range of 150–300 m/min, feed rates f  of 0.1 mm/r, depths of cut a p  of 0.5 mm. Flank wear was observed and measured using an optical microscope system linked via transducers to a digital read out. When flank wear reached 600 µm, the accumulated cutting length (L ) was regarded as tool life. Cutting temperature was determined using an infrared thermal image system (TVS-500EX, NEC, Japan). Analysis of worn rake and flank regions on the tools and chemical analysis of the worn regions was performed using the scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova NanoSEM430, FEI, The Netherlands).  3 Results and discussion 3.1 Microstructure and mechanical properties Microstructural analysis showed that the TB20 and TB80 composites had a homogeneous microstructure, as shown in  Fig. 1 . The black and grey phases were identified as B4 C and TiB2 , respectively. More pores were observed in TB20, compared with TB80 and this was consistent with the measurements of relative densities of TB20 and TB80, which were 95.5% and 98.1%, respectively. Microstructure of commercial WO cutting tool was also shown in Fig. 1 . According to the EDS analysis in the rectangle area of Fig. 1 c, Co content of the WO cutting tool was ~ 4 wt%. Results of flexural strength, fracture toughness, and Vickers hardness of TB20 and TB80 were presented in Table 1 . Flexure strength of TB20 was slightly lower than that of TB80 due to the relative low density, but fracture toughness was higher in TB20. Hardness of TB80 was 34% higher than that of TB20, due to the intrinsic high hardness of B4 C phase. Vickers hardness of WO was about 15% lower than TB20, but fracture toughness of WO was about 135% higher, also seen in Table 1 . It was found that mechanical properties of TB20, TB80, and WO were comparable with reported values on mechanical properties of TiB2 -B4 C and WC-Co materials in literatures [16–18] , as shown in Table 1 .  3.2 Cutting performance Cutting performance of TB20, TB80 and WO were studied. In general, the cutting processes were stable without catastrophic failure of the cutting edge during the machining for all of the materials evaluated.  Fig. 2  showed four plots of flank wear (VB ) of the three cutting tools versus cutting length (L ): TB20, TB80, and WO, at four different cutting speeds: 150, 200, 250, and 300 m/min. It can be seen that the wear rates of flank wear of TB20 and TB80 were high at the beginning of machining, and then become steady state with the increase in cutting length. On the other hand, the wear rate of WO was relative slow as compared to both TB20 and TB80 in the beginning of the cutting process, but increased dramatically as the cutting length increased at the later stage of machining, possibly suggestive of the end of tool life. The progressive and stable tool-wear rate was observed in both TB20 and TB80 during the cutting process, which was in sharp contrast to that of WO tool. Result of flank wear behavior suggested that the TiB2 -B4 C ceramic cutting tools exhibited a much longer lifetime performance than the commercially available cemented tungsten carbide cutting tool.  Fig. 3  shows the variation in effective cutting length of the tools with varying cutting speeds. Note that the tool life defined in the present study is when the flank wear reaches 600 µm. The effective cutting length of each tool dropped dramatically with increasing cutting speed. Among three cutting tools, the TB20 had the longest tool life at each cutting speed. The cutting temperatures corresponding to different tool flank wear were also measured. Measurements of the cutting temperature increased almost linearly with the increase of flank wear as shown in  Fig. 4 . At the beginning of turning when cutting tool was almost intact, the cutting temperatures of TB20, TB80, and WO were about 590 °C, 630 °C and 450 °C, respectively. When VB  was about reaching 600 µm, the cutting temperature increased to about 850 °C, 840 °C and 800 °C for TB20, TB80, and WO, respectively. The temperature increment of WO was about 120 °C higher than that of TiB2 -B4 C cutting tools with the increase of VB  from 0 to 600 µm. Temperature corresponding to each flank wear content was obtained in the very beginning of each feed after measurement of the flank wear, so temperature increment implied the damage degree of cutting edge condition. Presumably, cutting edge of WO would deteriorate severely as cutting continued, while TB20 and TB80 comparatively held a smooth wear rate.  3.3 Wear morphology and wear mechanism Observations of SEM images of the wear morphology projecting toward flank face, in dry turning of Ti6Al4V at cutting speed of 250 m/min, were shown in  Fig. 5 . The integrity of cutting edge of TB20 (Fig. 5 a) was the best as compared with that observed in TB80 (Fig. 5 c) and WO (Fig. 5 e), which suggested that TB20 might be still in stable wear stage. The main tool wear modes were also identified in Fig. 5 . As for TiB2 -B4 C cutting tools, several chippings with small size were observed in TB20, and work piece material build-up was developed in the chippings (Fig. 5 b). However, because of lower fracture toughness, chippings of TB80, especially in the position where in contact with work surface, were too large to be negligible. It was attributed to the work hardening of work surface of Ti6Al4V that chipping happened more severely at the boundary of the cutting edge where in contact with work surface. In the TB80, chipping mode would finally develop into notch wear (Fig. 5 c) under high speed intermittent impact of harden burr of work surface. As for TB20, due to the higher toughness, chipping size was relatively small and also very minor change occurred in the cutting edge structure, thus it was less prone to introduce burr and form notch wear. Toughness of WO was relatively much higher, so tipping would hardly happen. Nevertheless, the high-temperature resistance and high-temperature strength of cemented carbide was usually lower than TiB2 -B4 C ceramics, which led to high temperature deterioration of WO. As for TiB2 -based, B4 C-based or TiB2 -B4 C ceramics, considerable studies have shown that bending strength can maintain room temperature strength up to 1500 °C without reduction, or even slightly increase as temperature increasing [17,19–21] . For WC-Co composites, however, remarkable reduction in the bending strength at around 600 °C was observed, which was mainly due to the softening of the Co matrix, and further reduction at around 900 °C was predominately derived from WC softening [22–25] . As a result, the crater wear of WO was deeper when VB  reached 600 µm (Fig. 5 e). In addition, thermal attack in the crater from hot cutting chips gave rise to cracks and then adhesive and peel-off wear in WO (Fig. 5 f). Adhesive wear was prevalent in the rake face and flank face of WO, while adherent workpiece was most likely to gather on the small chippings and the boundary between crater and rake face of TB20 and TB80. The build-up workpiece on chippings might easily break way, but the strongly adherent pitch-like workpiece maintained an intimate and sustained contact with the rake face (Fig. 5 b, d). In addition, adhesive layer could be identified as a very thin film on the flank face of TB20 and TB80. Therefore, it could be proposed that the main wear mechanism was adhesive wear for TB20, adhesive wear and chipping for TB80, and adhesive wear and temperature deterioration for WO. Since adhesive wear was the dominant mechanism in these three tools, the detailed analysis of adhesive layer on the rake and flank face was conducted using SEM.  Fig. 6  and  Fig. 7  showed the microstructure and element distribution of cross-section perpendicular to the cutting edge of TB20 and WO after machining at cutting speed of 250 m/min, respectively. Observations of cross-section revealed the depth of wear and the extent of the damage to the tool surface. From the SEM images, the depth of flank wear of TB20 was about 50 µm (Fig. 6 a), and the depth of flank wear of WO was > 100 µm (Fig. 7 a). The white arrows in Fig. 6 b and Fig. 7 b corresponded to the EDS lines scan plot shown in Fig. 6 c and Fig. 7 c, respectively. There was a marked change in material composition from the surface of the crater of TB20 towards the tool substrate. Based on EDS data, the pitch-like adherent material with the thickness of about 30 µm came from the Ti6Al4V workpiece, Fig. 6 b. In addition, the EDS data confirmed that the adhesive layer (dark) with the thickness of about 40 µm resulting from the workpiece was also observed on the crater and the flank face of WO, Fig. 7 b. On the other hand, tool material particles carried away by the adhesive layer were found on the flank face of WO, and cracks that would led to a chunk of exfoliation from tool material were observed on the rake face, Fig. 7 a. It was generally well accepted that the dominant wear mechanism of tungsten-carbide tools during turning of titanium alloys was adhesion resulting from dissolution and diffusion process [26] . The large forces and high temperature during cutting, combined with the high titanium chemical reactivity, would lead to diffusion and adhesion of the tool elements into the Ti6Al4V chips and at the same time for the workpiece material elements bonded onto the tool surfaces [27] . Observations showed that thinner adherent layer, better integrity of cutting edge, and more legible borderline between layer and tool bulk were evident in the TB20, which suggested that the diffusion of tool elements into the Ti6Al4V alloy was very minor even at the high cutting temperature. Nevertheless, when the intimate layer was detached from the chip or workpiece, the high adhesive forces were likely to result in the plunking out of hard particles from the tool causing its surface to become groove and crater as well as flank wear depth to increase. For ultra-hard cutting tool materials, the resistance to plastic deformation at elevated temperatures would be an important intrinsic material property [28] . In compared with tungsten-carbides, TiB2 -B4 C ceramics could achieve a longer tool life and better performance in high speed cutting of Ti6Al4V alloys due to better high temperature properties. It was noted that the hardness of TB80 was much higher than that of TB20, but the tool life of TB80 was shorter than that of TB20. The hardness of TB20 was about 20.87 GPa, which was adequate for machining relative soft metals like titanium alloy. However, because of adhesive wear, the combination of crater and flank wear would undermine the integrity of cutting edge and those unsupported pieces would then break away [27] . In the final stage, the fracture toughness of the cutting tool material would play a more important role in determining the lifetime performance. The hardness of TiB2 -B4 C increased with the decrease of TiB2  content, while the fracture toughness decreased. Chipping of the cutting edge would be the main failure mode of the cutting tools as TiB2  content decreased. In addition, Ti could react with B4 C in vacuum at temperature above 1100 °C by the following reaction [29] :(1) 3Ti + B 4  C = TiB 2  + TiC     Reaction (1 ) could be initiated at a relatively lower temperature with the incorporation of air [30] . So, presumably, TiB2 -B4 C ceramic cutting tools with higher TiB2  content could have better cutting performance and longer tool life in cutting of Ti6Al4V alloys.   4 Conclusions TiB2 –20vol%B4 C (TB20) and TiB2 –80vol%B4 C (TB80) ceramic cutting tool materials were prepared by hot pressing. Vikers hardness of TB80 was about 27.99 GPa, 34% higher than that of TB20, whereas fracture toughness of TB80 was about 4.66 MPa m1/2 , 26% lower than that of TB20. In continuous cutting of Ti6Al4V alloy, the effective cutting length of TB20 was about one third longer than that of TB80 and cemented carbide (WO). Cutting temperature increments of TB20 and TB80 from VB  = 0 to 600 μm were much lower than that of WO. Wear mechanism was mainly adhesive wear for TB20, adhesive wear and chipping for TB80, and adhesive wear and temperature deterioration for WO. Hard particles plunk out through detaching of adhesive layer of TB20 and TB80,while diffusion through thick workpiece layer on WO gave rise to carried away of tool materials. Compared with tungsten carbides, the high wear resistance of TiB2 -B4 C cutting tools were resulted from their higher hardness and lower chemical affinity with titanium. TiB2 -B4 C ceramic cutting tools with higher TiB2  content may have better cutting performance and longer tool life in cutting of Ti6Al4V alloys, due to the increased toughness and decreased chemical affinity with titanium.

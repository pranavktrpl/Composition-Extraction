                  Y-doped BaCeO3 (BCY), a solid state ion conductor which exhibits mixed proton and oxide ion conductivity under some conditions, was used as an electrolyte in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The conductivities of 10% and 25% Y-doped BaCeO3 (BCY10 and BCY25) were measured under a single gas atmosphere of 5% hydrogen in argon (5% H2/Ar), air and pure argon (Ar). Furthermore, a dual-chamber SOFC reactor was used to investigate the conductivities of the BCY10 and BCY25 electrolytes under fuel cell conditions, i.e., 5% hydrogen in argon at the anode with air at the cathode. The performance of BCY-based SOFC with Pt electrodes was measured over a temperature range of 500–800 °C using a galvanostat/potentiostat. Both anode and cathode product stream compositions were analysed using a gas chromatograph and a hygrometer. A material balance for the system was performed in order to estimate proton and oxygen ion fluxes across the electrolyte. Water transport across the electrolyte in the absence of an external circuit was also studied.

Y-doped BaCeO3  (BCY), a solid state ion conductor which exhibits mixed proton and oxide ion conductivity under some conditions, was used as an electrolyte in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The conductivities of 10% and 25% Y-doped BaCeO3  (BCY10 and BCY25) were measured under a single gas atmosphere of 5% hydrogen in argon (5% H2 /Ar), air and pure argon (Ar). Furthermore, a dual-chamber SOFC reactor was used to investigate the conductivities of the BCY10 and BCY25 electrolytes under fuel cell conditions, i.e., 5% hydrogen in argon at the anode with air at the cathode. The performance of BCY-based SOFC with Pt electrodes was measured over a temperature range of 500–800 °C using a galvanostat/potentiostat. Both anode and cathode product stream compositions were analysed using a gas chromatograph and a hygrometer. A material balance for the system was performed in order to estimate proton and oxygen ion fluxes across the electrolyte. Water transport across the electrolyte in the absence of an external circuit was also studied.

These materials are predominantly proton-conducting ceramics but can exhibit oxide ion conductivity under some conditions. The conduction phenomena in these materials may be explained by an appropriate defect model (here we use the Kröger–Vink notation). Under humidified conditions, hydroxide species can be produced by the oxidation of water vapour as shown in Reaction (1) . In the presence of hydrogen, hydrogen can react with oxide ions in the lattice producing hydroxide groups and electrons as in Reaction (2) . It is believed that protons could migrate by hopping from the OHo •  site to oxide ion site at a normal lattice site nearby causing this material to exhibit the proton conductivity [8,9] .(1) H2 O(g)  + Oo x   + Vo ••  = 2OHo •    (2) 1 2  H 2 ( g )    + O o x  = O H o ·  + e ′ .     In the presence of oxygen, the conduction phenomena should depend on the partial pressure of oxygen. At high oxygen partial pressure, the dissolution of oxygen into the crystal structure of these ceramics may occur as expressed in Reaction (3)  resulting in the creation of an oxide ion in the lattice and electron holes [4,10] .(3) 1 2  O 2 ( g )    + V o · ·   = O o x  + 2 h ·  .     At low oxygen partial pressure, oxide ions may leave the lattice creating oxygen vacancies and electrons as expressed in Reaction (4) . Furthermore, it is believed that at high temperatures oxide ions in the lattice may become excited and migrate to other oxygen vacancies nearby [11] ,(4) O o x  = 1 2  O 2 ( g )    + V o · ·   + 2 e ′ .     The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of the mole fraction of Y dopant on the conduction properties of this electrolyte material and the degree of mixed proton and oxide ion conductivity in terms of its proton and oxide ion transport numbers. In this paper, the total conductivities of BCY10 and BCY25 in various gas atmospheres including hydrogen-containing, oxygen-containing and pure argon were measured using an AC impedance analyser. In addition, the proton and oxide ion transport numbers were estimated by measuring the amount of hydrogen consumed at the anode and water produced at the cathode simultaneously during fuel cell operation. Overall material balance and basic electrochemical calculations provided an accurate value of ionic transport numbers.  2 Experimental The BCY10 and BCY25 electrolytes were prepared by the sol gel method. The desired proportion of precursors BaCO3  (99+%, Aldrich), Ce(NO3 )3 ·6H2 O (99+%, Aldrich) and Y(NO3 )3 ·6H2 O (99+%, Aldrich) were dissolved in citric acid aqueous solution. Ethylene glycol was added and the solution was stirred at 90 °C until it turned into a yellow transparent gel. The gel was then dried at 150 °C overnight to remove excess solvent and annealed at 400 °C for 2 h to obtain a light yellow powder. Subsequently, the powder was calcined at 1400 °C for 6 h in air. X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometer, fitted with an X'Celerator) was used to verify the presence of the perovskite structure in the BCY powder by comparison with data from the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) database. The electrolyte powder was pressed at 3 × 103  bar into a 2-cm diameter with 1 mm-thickness pellet and sintered at 1450 °C for 12 h in air. The density of the sintered pellets was approximately 95% relative to the theoretical density [12] . Platinum electrodes were sputtered on both sides of the electrolyte pellets and a platinum mesh connected to a platinum wire was attached to each platinum electrode using platinum ink as a binder. The projected area of the platinum electrode was 0.5 cm2 . The pellet was then fired at 1000 °C for 1 h. The performance of the BCY10 and BCY25-based SOFCs were tested by running a discharge current versus voltage (I –V ) curve and measuring current at a constant applied voltage for several days. 2.1 Conductivity measurements The electrolyte pellet was placed into a single chamber reactor. The reactor was installed into a horizontal split tube furnace (Vecstar) and the cell was connected with a frequency response analyser (Newton's 4th 1700 PSIMEREIQ, Amel) in order to measure the AC impedance spectra across the electrolyte. The feed flow rate of 100 ml/min at 20 °C, 1 atm was fed to the reactor. AC current with 100 mV amplitude was applied to the cell at open circuit conditions with a frequency sweep from 1 MHz to 1 Hz. The impedance spectra were recorded several times until similar results in each frequency scan loop were obtained.  2.2 Ionic transport number measurements To measure proton and oxide ion transport numbers of the electrolytes, a dual-chamber reactor was used. The electrolyte pellet was placed on top of an alumina tube and was sealed using high temperature cement (Blackite), thus separating the two chambers. To minimize leaks from the atmosphere that would compromise the results, ultra-high vacuum Swagelok fittings were used to connect the different parts of the reactor. The anode and cathode compartments were under a flow of 5% H2 /Ar and air, respectively. The flow rate of each gas was 60 ml/min at 20 °C, 1 atm. The terminal voltage across two electrodes during current discharge was measured over the operating temperature range of 500–800 °C using a galvanostat/potentiostat (Amel 7040 G/P). The fuel cell was operated at a constant voltage for several hours. The amount of H2  in the anode outlet stream was measured by GC (molecular sieve 5A column & TCD, Varian CP-3800) and water content in the cathode outlet stream was measured by a chilled mirror dew point hygrometer (Alpha Moisture System CMH-1). The proton and oxide ion transport numbers were calculated by the following set of equations.(5) q H +   = 2 ⌊ ( q H 2  O , C   )  V = V   − ( q H 2  O , C   )  V = OCV   ⌋     (6) q O 2 −    = ( q H 2  , A   )  V = OCV   − ( q H 2  , A   )  V = V   − 2 q H +      (7) I i  = n F q i     (8) t i  = I i   I total        where q x ,y   is a molar flow rate of species x  in the outlet from the y  chamber (mol/s), A and C are anode and cathode chambers, I i   is the current produced by the transport of ion i  (A), n  is the number of electrons involved in an electrode reaction, F  is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol) and t i   is the ionic transport number of ion i . Fig. 1   describes a mixed proton and oxide ion conductor-based SOFC operation at a constant voltage. The amount of protons transferring across the electrolyte can be calculated from the amount of water produced in the cathode chamber as expressed in Eq. (5) . Meanwhile, the molar flow rate of oxide ions transferring across the electrolyte should be equal to the molar flow of consumed hydrogen subtracted by the molar flow rate of hydrogen transferring to the cathode side in the form of protons as expressed in Eq. (6) . Finally, the proton and oxide ion transport numbers can be calculated from Eqs. (7) and (8) .  2.3 Water permeation measurements The dual-chamber fuel cell reactor described in Section 2.2  was also used to investigate the ability of water to cross the electrolyte. In this experiment, dry argon was fed into one chamber and humidified argon which contained approximately 2.3% mole fraction of water vapour was fed into the other chamber. The change of water content in the dry argon chamber was measured by the dew point hygrometer. Leak tests were performed by feeding a 2.3% mole fraction of nitrogen in argon into one chamber and dry argon into the other. By assuming that the amount of nitrogen leaking to the dry argon chamber is equivalent to the amount of water that leaks, the net amount of water permeating across the electrolyte can be estimated.   3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis Fig. 2   shows the XRD patterns of the BCY10 and BCY25 powders. The stick patterns above the BCY10 and BCY25 results are the data of standard materials from the ICDD database. The lattice parameters of the BCY10 and BCY25 determined by XRD analysis are given in Table 1  . It can be seen from Fig. 2  that a single phase perovskite was obtained in the case of BCY10 while for BCY25 there was a set of Y-doped ceria (YDC) peaks along with a BCY-phase but no unreacted Y2 O3  or BaCO3 . The primary peak of the BCY25 sample and e.g. YDC50 from the ICDD database appear at the same position which means that the composition of the sample and, therefore, the actual amount of yttrium doped into barium cerate cannot be calculated. Ma et al. [7]  studied the dependence of ionic conductivity on the degree of nonstoichiometry in Bax  Ce0.9 Y0.1 O3−α   with 0.8 ≤ x  ≤ 1.2 and suggested that Bax  Ce0.9 Y0.1 O3−α   with x  > 1 might be formed because of the presence of excess BaO in the sample. However, this excess BaO was not detected by XRD for several reasons (see the explanation in Ref. [7] ). In this work, because no BaCO3  remains in the BCY25 sample, the only possible way that this sample can contain the mixed phases of BCY and YDC is for the nonstoichiometric Bax  Ce(1−y ) Yy  O3−α   with x  > 1 to be present. In order to determine the stoichiometry of the Bax  Ce(1−y ) Yy  O3−α   a material balance was performed. Table 2   shows the possible values of x  and y  and calculates value of z  in Bax  Ce(1−y ) Yy  O3−α   and Ce(1−z ) Yz  O2−α  ; also shown is the molar ratio of Bax  Ce(1−y ) Yy  O3−α   to Ce(1−z  )Yz  O2−α  . According to the literature [13] , the unit cell volume (v ) of BCY decreases with increasing Y content. However, Ma et al. [7]  studied the effect of x  on the unit cell volume of Bax  Ce0.9 Y0.1 O3−α   with 0.8 ≤ x  ≤ 1.2 and observed that the unit cell volume increased with increasing Ba content for x  ≥ 1. In this work, the unit cell volume of the BCY25 sample is slightly greater than BCY10. In Table 1 , we can see that in comparison with BCY10, the unit cell volume of BCY25 is barely changed (a 0.06% difference which is not significant given the limitations of determination of this value from XRD [14] ). The results presented by Ma et al. [7]  showed that the unit cell volume of Bax  Ce0.9 Y0.1 O3−α   increased significantly when x  increased from 1 to 1.2 (a 0.6% increase). We have no evidence for such a significant change in unit cell volume. Here, the similar values of the unit cell volume of the BCY25 sample and the BCY10 suggest that the value of x  could not be as high as 1.6 if the BCY25 sample was simply a mixture of BCY10 with a second phase such as YDC50. This means that although the exact composition of the BCY25 sample cannot be stated with certainty the sample is expected to contain a BCY-phase with more than 10% yttria present in the crystal lattice.  3.2 Fuel cell test The fuel cell performance was tested by a galvanostat. The results in Fig. 3   show that although the BCY25 was contaminated by YDC, the performance of the BCY25 based-SOFC is better than that of BCY10-based one. The maximum power densities produced from the BCY10 and BCY25-based SOFCs operated at 750 °C using 5% H2  in Ar as a fuel were about 23 and 41 mW/cm2 , respectively. The fuel cells were operated at a constant terminal voltage of − 0.5 V (the voltage that provided the maximum power density) for several days. The current measured at this condition was stable during the whole period of the fuel cell operation.  3.3 Conductivity Fig. 4   shows the comparison of impedance spectra measured with the BCY10 and BCY25 samples at 300 °C under humidified 5% H2 /Ar, air and Ar atmospheres. The pictures in the right hand side of Fig. 4 (a) and (b) are the close-up images of the impedance spectra at high frequencies. It can be seen that under a humidified 5% H2 /Ar atmosphere, which contained around 2.3% mole fraction of water, the impedance spectra of BCY10 and BCY25 look similar in size and shape. At this temperature, we could see the beginning of a bulk arc in the high frequency range while a complete grain boundary arc appeared in the medium frequency range and a partial electrode arc appeared in the lower frequency range. Under dry air and dry argon atmospheres, the impedance spectra of both BCY10 and BCY25 provided similar patterns, i.e., two arcs which should represent the bulk and grain boundary arcs appeared over the entire observed frequency range. However, the impedance of BCY25 under these atmospheres was much smaller than that of BCY10 which implies that the conductivity of BCY25 is greater than that of BCY10 under dry air and dry argon atmospheres. At higher temperatures, the electrode reactions should be faster causing the electrode, grain boundary and bulk arcs (data not shown in this paper) to shift to higher frequencies and hence, at high temperatures, the bulk arcs do not appear in the observed frequency range (1 Hz–1 MHz). This phenomenon was also observed by Potter and Baker [15]  who studied the conduction behaviour of 5% Yb doped-SrCeO3  (the proton-conducting perovskite ceramic which has the similar conduction behaviour as BCY) under humidified and dried hydrogen, air and argon atmosphere. By running a frequency response analyser over the wider range of frequency (32 MHz–0.01 Hz), for dry air and argon at 350 °C, they could observe the partial electrode responses at the frequencies below 10 Hz. As seen in Fig. 4 , the impedance arcs are overlapping which make the data difficult to interpret. The technique presented by Abrantes et al. [16]  was used to interpret the intercept of overlapped arcs. In their work, they derived the relation of Z ′ and Z ″ based on the equivalent model consisting of 3 series associations of RC components which represent bulk, grain boundary and electrode components. The ultimate equations in cases of the bulk and grain boundary overlap and the grain boundary and electrode overlap are expressed in Eqs. (9) and (10) .(9) Z ′ = R B  ( 1 − f GB   f B    )  + ( Z ″  f  )  f GB     (10) Z ′ = R B  + R GB  ( 1 − f EL   f GB    )  + ( Z ″  f  )  f EL     where f B , f GB  and f EL  are bulk, grain boundary and electrode relaxation frequencies, respectively. The intercepts and slopes of the plot of Z ′ vs. Z ″ / f  allow for the estimation of the bulk and grain boundary resistances. The Arrhenius plot of the electrolyte (bulk + grain boundary) conductivity is shown in Fig. 5  . Although there are significant uncertainties in the electrolyte resistance estimated from the impedance data, the Arrhenius plot is on a logarithmic scale and activation energies can still be estimated reasonably well. In Fig. 5 , under a humidified-hydrogen atmosphere as BCY is intrinsically oxygen deficient, the presence of Reactions (1) and (2)  could lead to mixed proton and n-type conductivity. However, in general, such perovskite-type proton-conducting ceramics as this material exhibit proton conductivity with little electronic conductivity [18] . In dry air, which contains approximately a 20% oxygen mole fraction, oxide-ion conductivity is suggested to be dominant at low temperatures while p-type conductivity is suggested to be dominant at elevated temperatures [4,10,19] . In dry argon which contains approximately 1 ppm of oxygen, this material should exhibit oxide-ion conductivity [4,10,19] . However, under this atmosphere, p-type conductivity increased with increasing temperature. The activation energy in BCY10 under dry air and dry argon atmospheres may change when the predominant conduction phenomena change from oxide-ion conduction at low temperatures into p-type conduction at high temperatures. By comparing the conductivity of BCY10 with BCY25, we can see that under a humidified 5% H2 /Ar atmosphere, the conductivity of BCY25 was very close to that of BCY10 which means that the amount of oxygen ion vacancies did not significantly affect the proton conductivity in this material. On the other hand, the concentration of oxygen ion vacancies played an important role on the conductivity in dry air and dry argon atmospheres where the conductivity of BCY25 was up to three times higher than that of BCY10. There are two possible reasons why the conductivity of the nominal BCY25 is greater than that of BCY10. The increase could be due to the presence of YDC, a predominant oxide ion conductor [20–23] , in the nominal BCY25 or it could be due to the change in conductivity of the BCY phase itself as it now contains more than 10 mol% of yttrium in barium cerate. According to the literature [20,21] , the conductivity of pure YDC in air is in the same order of magnitude as the conductivity of the nominal BCY25 measured in this work. It is therefore unlikely that the presence of a randomly distributed second phase of YDC in BCY10 could result in a conductivity three times greater than that of BCY10. However, if the YDC is preferentially located at the grain boundaries the conductivity of the BCY25 sample may be modified and this possibility cannot be ruled out.  3.4 Capacitance The capacitance per unit electrode area associated with the conduction processes at bulk and grain boundary were calculated from Eq. (11) :(11) C i  = 1 ω max  Z i  ″ ( ω max  )  A      where Z i  ″, ω max  and A  are an imaginary part of impedance, a maximum angular frequency of arc i  and an electrode area, respectively. Table 3   presents the bulk and grain boundary capacitances of BCY10 and BCY25 in comparison with SCYb5 [15] . It can be seen that in humidified hydrogen the grain boundary capacitance of SCYb5 is about twice that of BCY10 and BCY25 while, in air and argon, the bulk capacitances of BCY10 and BCY25 are up to four orders of magnitude greater than SCYb5. For BCY10, the bulk capacitance in air is lower than in argon but in case of BCY25 the opposite is observed.  3.5 Proton and oxide ion transport numbers Fig. 6   shows the proton and oxide ion transport numbers of BCY10 and BCY25 over the temperature range of 500–800 °C. It can be seen that the proton transport numbers of BCY10 and BCY25 were in unity at temperatures below 550 and 500 °C. At higher temperatures in both BCY10 and BCY25, the proton transport number decreased while oxide ion transport number increased with increasing temperature. Furthermore, we can see that BCY10 exhibits predominant proton conductivity up to 700 °C while BCY25 exhibits mixed conduction at temperatures above 550 °C. Fig. 7   is the plot of proton transport number of BCY10 against the terminal voltage across the fuel cell. It can be seen that the proton transport number of BCY10 was dependent on the terminal voltage at temperatures below 750 °C. In this temperature region, the proton transport number increases slightly with increasing potential difference between anode and cathode of the fuel cell.  3.6 Water permeation If the BCY is a mixed proton and oxide-ion conductor then under open circuit conditions it should be possible for steam to permeate across the BCY membrane. Therefore, the molar fluxes of water permeating across the BCY10 and BCY25 electrolyte and the current densities corresponding to those amounts of water were calculated. The results in Fig. 8   indicate that there was the significant amount of water detected in the dry argon chamber which is consistent with this material being both a proton and oxide-ion conductor in this temperature range. The steam permeation fluxes across the BCY10 over the temperature range of 600–800 °C are compared with the model results presented by Coors [24] . Coors predicted the water permeation flux based on solid state diffusion being the rate determining step and using the chemical diffusion coefficient for water derived by Kreuer et al. [25,26] . The experimental water permeation results obtained in this work are of the same order of magnitude as the modelling results. However, the degree of water permeation predicted by Coors seems to be more sensitive to the temperature than that measured in this work. This may be because, under the conditions of this study, the rate determining step for water permeation is not solid state transport.   4 Conclusion In this work, the conductivities of BCY10 and BCY25 samples prepared by the sol gel method were investigated in terms of the total electrolyte conductivity and proton and oxide ion transport numbers. A single phase of BCY10 was obtained while the BCY25 sample contained mixed phases of BCY and YDC. Comparisons of the conductivity and proton and oxide-ion transport numbers of BCY10 and BCY25 were performed. BCY25 exhibited mixed proton and oxide ion conductivity at temperatures higher than 550 °C. Over the entire temperature range of 500–750 °C BCY10 exhibited predominant proton conduction with mixed conduction above 750 °C. The more rapid increase with respect to temperature in the oxide ion transport number of BCY25, in comparison with BCY10, may be because of an increase in the amount of Y dopant and/or the presence of a predominant oxide ion conductor, YDC, in this sample. Water permeation through both BCY10 and BCY25 could be observed. This confirms the presence of mixed proton and oxide ion conduction in these materials. A previous model to describe water permeation did not fit well with the experimental results possibly because the rate determining step for water permeation is not solid state transport here.

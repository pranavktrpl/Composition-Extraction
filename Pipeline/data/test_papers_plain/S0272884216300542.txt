                  W-reinforced Ti(CN) with enhanced mechanical properties was prepared by spark plasma sintering of premixed Ti(CN)–W powder. The powder was prepared by milling and subsequent heat treatment of the TiO2–WO3–C mixture. The low affinity between W and C/N enabled the W particles to be embedded in the Ti(CN) matrix during heat–treatment. The uniformly distributed W particles in the Ti(CN) had a role in interrupting the crack propagation and enhancing the fracture toughness (K
                     IC: 7.65MPam1/2). The high hardness of W, compared to those of other metals (Ni, Co), hardens the W–Ti(CN) cermet over other conventional Ti(CN)–based cermets (H
                     V: 30.8GPa). The mechanical properties of the W–Ti(CN) were comparable to those of B–based superhard cermets. The W–Ti(CN) cermet could have considerable potential for use in structural applications.

W-reinforced Ti(CN) with enhanced mechanical properties was prepared by spark plasma sintering of premixed Ti(CN)–W powder. The powder was prepared by milling and subsequent heat treatment of the TiO2 –WO3 –C mixture. The low affinity between W and C/N enabled the W particles to be embedded in the Ti(CN) matrix during heat–treatment. The uniformly distributed W particles in the Ti(CN) had a role in interrupting the crack propagation and enhancing the fracture toughness (K IC : 7.65 MPa m1/2 ). The high hardness of W, compared to those of other metals (Ni, Co), hardens the W–Ti(CN) cermet over other conventional Ti(CN)–based cermets (H V : 30.8 GPa). The mechanical properties of the W–Ti(CN) were comparable to those of B–based superhard cermets. The W–Ti(CN) cermet could have considerable potential for use in structural applications.   Keywords Carbides  Sintering  Hardness  Toughness and toughening    1 Introduction TiC and Ti(CN) have been used as materials for cutting tools because of their excellent structural properties including their high hardness, high wear resistance and chemical stability [1–2] . The hardness of TiC and Ti(CN) is about 33 GPa, which is a higher value than that of WC (~24 GPa) [3] . The high hardness and wear resistance make TiC and Ti(CN) suitable for high speed machining of steel. On the other hand, the toughness of TiC and Ti(CN) are not superior compared to that of WC. The application of TiC and Ti(CN)–based cermets are limited to particular processes (finishing work) based on their cutting performance due to their low toughness [4] . Generally, the low toughness of Ti(CN)–based cermets has been improved in various ways. The low toughness of TiC and Ti(CN) has been improved by adding WC and 15~30 wt% of metallic phases (Ni or Co) [5–8] . Recently, the most common method for improving the toughness is to make TiC and Ti(CN)–based cermets using carbides or carbonitrides in the form of solid-solution phases. The toughness of the cermets prepared from the solid-solution carbides/carbonitrides are in the range of 12–13.8 MPa m1/2 [9] . However, the hardness of composites toughened by adding metallic phases/whiskers or by preparing solid-solution carbides/carbonitrides inevitably decreases compared to that of intrinsic TiC/Ti(CN) (below ~15 GPa) [5–9] . In the present study, we prepared W-reinforced Ti(CN) to obtain a Ti(CN)–based cermet with a higher hardness than that of conventional Ti(CN)-based cermets. To begin with, we successfully synthesized Ti(CN)–W powder by carbothermal reduction of a mechanically ground TiO2 –WO3 /graphite mixture in a nitrogen atmosphere. The W-reinforced Ti(CN) was obtained by spark plasma sintering of the Ti(CN)–W powder. The mechanical properties of the W-reinforced Ti(CN) were compared with those of not only conventional Ti(CN)–Ni cermets but also boron–based cermets. The enhanced properties of the W-reinforced Ti(CN) are explained by the microstructure of the sintered body.  2 Experimental procedure A ti(CN)–W mixture was synthesized with rutile-TiO2  (Junsei chemical, >99% purity) and WO3  (Fluka chemical, >99% purity, 20 μm avg. particle size) powders (molar ratio of ti:W=9:1). the powders were mixed with graphite (Alfa, 99.8%, 45 μm avg. particle size) to attain the ti(CN)–W mixture. the powders were subjected to high energy milling using A planetary mill (model Pulverisette 5, Fritsch, Germany). tungsten carbide balls were mixed with TiO2 , WO3 , and graphite at A ball to powder weight ratio of 16:1. A stainless steel bowl was used, and the milling was done at A speed of 200 RPM for 20 h. the milled powder was heat–treated at 1300 °C for 5 h in A nitrogen atmosphere at 10 Torr to complete the carbonitride formation reaction. the phases in the milled and heat–treated powders were analyzed with X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (SmartLab, Rigaku, Japan). Monochromatized cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5418 Å) was used during the analyses, and si was used as A standard to calibrate the diffractometer. the morphology of the powders was examined with A field–emission scanning electron microscope (quanta 650, FEI, Oregon, USA). The synthesized Ti(CN)–W powder was placed in a graphite die (outside diameter, 35 mm; inside diameter, 10 mm; height, 40 mm) and introduced into the spark plasma sintering system (Eltek, South Korea). The sintering was done typically in four stages. The system was evacuated (stage 1) and subjected to a uniaxial pressure of 80 MPa (stage 2). An induced current was activated and maintained until densification occurred indicated by a linear gauge measuring sample shrinkage (stage 3). The temperature was measured by an optical pyrometer that was focused on the surface of the graphite die. The sintering continued until the shrinkage reached a constant value at 1600, 1700, and 1750 °C. Afterwards, the compact was cooled to room temperature (stage 4). The Vickers hardness of the sintered Ti(CN)–W bodies was measured with an indenter load of 20 kg, and fracture toughness was calculated using the expression derived by Shetty et al. [10] .  3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation of the premixed ti(CN)–W powder  Fig. 1 (a) and (b) shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the phases evolved during the high-energy milling of the TiO2 , WO3  and C mixture and the carbothermal reduction of the mixture in a nitrogen atmosphere, respectively. When high-energy milling was done on the TiO2 , WO3  and C mixture for 20 h, the size reduction of the TiO2 , WO3  and graphite phases was apparent without any chemical reaction. In contrast, it was clearly seen that Ti(CN) and W are the only phases after the heat–treatment at 1300 °C. It is known that the carbothermal reduction of a TiO2 –WO3  mixture occurs as follows: the reduction of WO3 , the reduction of TiO2  and carburization/nitridation of the reduced phases [11] . However, it is obvious that W was not carburized and nitrided as seen in Fig. 1 (b). The absence of WC or WN phases in the heat–treated powder might be explained in terms of the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the carbide/nitride or carbonitride phases associated with Ti and W.  Table 1  lists the Standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the carbide/nitride or carbonitride phases [12] . It can be found that the Ti-based carbide/nitride or carbonitride phases are considerably more stable than that of the W–based carbide/nitride phases. In addition, WN is an unstable phase at 1500 K (positive Standard Gibbs free energy of formation), which means that W would not react with nitrogen under normal pressure. Therefore, it is obvious that the low affinity between W and C/N (compared to that of Ti and C/N) is the reason why WC or WN was not formed after the heat–treatment of the TiO2 –WO3  mixture.  Fig. 2  shows the SEM/BSE images of the heat–treated powder. It is worth noting that the W particles (white contrast) are rather uniformly distributed inside the powder. It was postulated that W-reinforced Ti(CN) could be fabricated by spark plasma sintering of a uniformly W-distributed powder.  Table 2  lists the amounts of carbon and nitrogen in the heat–treated powder. The chemical formula and theoretical density were calculated by the amount of carbon and nitrogen. The theoretical density of the phases in the heat–treated powder was used for the calculation of the relative density of the W-reinforced Ti(CN) after sintering.  3.2 Microstructure and mechanical properties of the ti(CN)–W sintered by spark plasma sintering  Fig. 3  shows the shrinkage behavior during the sintering of the Ti(CN)–W by SPS. It was found that the shrinkage displacement virtually stops at temperatures over 1700 °C. This means that sintering of the Ti(CN)–W was completed at 1700 °C. This can also be confirmed by the relative density values of the sintered samples ( Table 3 ). The relative density of the sample sintered at 1600 °C was 90% while complete densification occurs at over 1700 °C.  Fig. 4 (a)(b)(c) are the SEM micrographs showing the microstructure of the sample sintered at 1700 °C. It is seen that the W phase (white area) is distributed uniformly in the microstructure (Fig. 4 (a)). Here, the particle size of W was not changed during sintering due to the short sintering time (3 min). Fig. 4 (b) shows the low magnification indent. Fig. 4 (c) is the high-magnification micrograph revealing the crack propagation path after the indentation test. It was found that the crack propagates through the Ti(CN) particles and stops at the ductile W phase. It is plausible that the energy to break the ductile W phase is higher than that for the brittle Ti(CN) phase. If so, then it is expected that the fracture toughness of the W–Ti(CN) can be improved by the uniform distribution of the ductile W phase. Table 3  lists the mechanical properties of the sintered W–Ti(CN) samples and other relevant cermets. The hardness values of the Ti(CN)–W samples are 29–30 GPa, which are significantly higher than those of the conventional TiC/Ti(CN)–based cermets (9–15 GPa). The hardness value is almost comparable to the intrinsic hardness of Ti(CN) [3] . Obviously, one of the reasons for the high hardness of W–Ti(CN) would be the high hardness of W compared to that of other matrix metals (Ni and Co). In addition to the high hardness, its fracture toughness is not far inferior to those of the conventional Ti(CN)–based cermets. Moreover, the fracture toughness of W–Ti(CN) is greater than those of the B–based superhard cermets (B4 C–Al, cBN–Al) which have comparable hardness values. In any case, it is obvious that the uniformly distributed W phase in the W–Ti(CN) has an important role in enhancing its fracture toughness ( Table 4 ).   4 Conclusions Herein, we fabricated a highly hardened W–Ti(CN) cermet by spark plasma sintering of a premixed Ti(CN)–W powder. A Ti(CN)–W powder with a uniformly distributed W was prepared by heat–treatment of a milled TiO2 –WO3 –C mixture. The hardness of the W–Ti(CN) cermet was significantly higher than that of conventional Ti(CN)–based cermets due to the higher hardness of the W than that of other metals (Ni or Co). The uniformly distributed W in the W–Ti(CN) was found to interrupt the crack propagation resulting in an enhanced toughness. The hardness (29.03–30.08 GPa) and fracture toughness (29.03–30.08 MPa m1/2 ) of the W–Ti(CN) are comparable to those of B–based superhard cermets. Based on these results, we believe that the W–Ti(CN) described herein has considerable potential for use in various structural applications.

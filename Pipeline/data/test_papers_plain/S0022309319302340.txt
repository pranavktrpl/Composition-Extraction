                  Sm3+ doped lithium zinc alumino borate glasses with composition 15ZnF2–12Li2CO3–10BaO–8Al2O3–(55-x)B2O3–xSm2O3 where x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.1 mol% were prepared by conventional melt quenching technique Their optical, physical, structural, mechanical and luminescence properties are investigated. UV–Vis-NIR absorption spectra showed all possible transitions of samarium ion in this glass matrix. Band gap values for all the glass samples were above 3 eV confirming the insulating nature for the glass. Densities, assessed using the Archimedes rule, were observed to be increasing with increasing samarium concentration. Increase in molar volume with addition of samarium content indicated that the extension of glass network is on account of the increase of number of Non-Bridging Oxygens created by network modifier samarium ions. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) image showed a smooth surface for the synthezied glass. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) technique was employed to verify the amorphous nature of the glasses. A Makishima and Mackenzie theoretical model gave acceptable approximation of elasticity constants viz. Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio. The high Vickers hardness values evaluated with mechanical loads of 50, 100, 300, 500, 1000 g force, proved the stability of the glasses. Emission spectra showed a prominent transition 4G5/2 → 6H7/2 at 598 nm excited with 6H5/2 → 4P3/2 transition at 401 nm. Luminescence quenching effect was observed beyond 0.3 mol% Sm2O3 addition. The chromaticity coordinates (x, y) clustered in the orange-red region, making these Sm3+ doped lithium zinc alumino borate glasses suitable candidate for applications in LEDs and solid-state lasers.

Sm3+  doped lithium zinc alumino borate glasses with composition 15ZnF2 –12Li2 CO3 –10BaO–8Al2 O3 –(55-x)B2 O3 –xSm2 O3  where x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.1 mol% were prepared by conventional melt quenching technique Their optical, physical, structural, mechanical and luminescence properties are investigated. UV–Vis-NIR absorption spectra showed all possible transitions of samarium ion in this glass matrix. Band gap values for all the glass samples were above 3 eV confirming the insulating nature for the glass. Densities, assessed using the Archimedes rule, were observed to be increasing with increasing samarium concentration. Increase in molar volume with addition of samarium content indicated that the extension of glass network is on account of the increase of number of Non-Bridging Oxygens created by network modifier samarium ions. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) image showed a smooth surface for the synthezied glass. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) technique was employed to verify the amorphous nature of the glasses. A Makishima and Mackenzie theoretical model gave acceptable approximation of elasticity constants viz. Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio. The high Vickers hardness values evaluated with mechanical loads of 50, 100, 300, 500, 1000 g force, proved the stability of the glasses. Emission spectra showed a prominent transition 4 G5/2  → 6 H7/2  at 598 nm excited with 6 H5/2  → 4 P3/2  transition at 401 nm. Luminescence quenching effect was observed beyond 0.3 mol% Sm2 O3  addition. The chromaticity coordinates (x, y) clustered in the orange-red region, making these Sm3+  doped lithium zinc alumino borate glasses suitable candidate for applications in LEDs and solid-state lasers.   Keywords Samarium  Photoluminescence  Rare earth  Vickers hardness  XRD  Makishima and Mackenzie  Radiation shielding    1 Introduction Samarium rare earth ion (Sm3+ ) is popular for its applications in high density optical storage devices, corrosion-free glasses in undersea communications, solid state lasers, spectral hole burning investigations, etc. [1–3 ]. Emission produced by Sm3+  ions at longer wavelengths (red/orange) due to their 4 G5/2  → 6 H5/2 , 4 G5/2  → 6 H7/2 , 4 G5/2  → 6 H9/2 , 4 G5/2  → 6 H11/2  transitions, is a source for solid state lighting and display devices. The red luminescence is also used in plasma displays and CRT tubes [3–5 ]. Among the different types of hosts like silicate (SiO2 ), tellurite (TeO2 ), borate (B2 O3 ) host matrix is suitable with good transparency, high thermal stability, good rare earth ion solubility, low cost and low melting point [6–7 ]. Since the energy difference in the next lower level and the emission level is quite larger than the phonon energy of the borate glasses, the luminescence of Sm3+  is not affected by the multi-phonon non-radiative decay [8 ]. Oxyfluoroborate glasses have the combined advantages of low attenuation of fluoride glasses, high mechanical stability of oxide glasses and very good transparency of borate glasses [9 ]. Addition of Al2 O3  to the matrix helps in preventing the clustering of rare earth ions, thus improving their optical stability [7 ]. Incorporation of ZnF2  helps in enhancing refractive index, thereby generating high and intense luminescence spectra [9–11 ]. A combination of Al2 O3  and ZnF2  also enhances the chemical durability and mechanical strength of the glass [12 ]. Glass forming capability of the borate glasses can be improved with the addition of alkali ions with optimal concentration [13 ]. Introduction of any alkali oxide like Li2 O can cause conversion of BO3  triangular units to BO4  tetrahedra units making the structure tighter or more compact [13–14 ]. Moreover, alkali metal ions help in improving mechanical properties and moisture resistance [15–18 ]. BaO plays a similar role like alkali oxide by converting BO3  triangular units to BO4  tetrahedra units [19 ]. As BaO is a heavy metal oxide, it also helps in increasing the density of the glasses, enriching the radition shielding ability. Many researchers (on similar glass compositions) like Shaweta Mohan, et al. (in lead alumino borate) [2 ], Nisha Deopa, et al. (in lithium lead alumino borate) [20 ], Sd. Zulfiqar Ali Ahamed, et al. (in lead barium zinc lithium fluoroborate) [5 ], Parvinder Kaur, et al. (in lithium aluminoborate) [21 ], P. Rekha Rani, et al. (in barium lead alumino fluoroborate) [22 ] have successfully reported towards Sm3+  orange/red emission devices. On the other hand, in the radiation shielding domain, Sm3+  doped lead alumino borate with lithium/barium/zinc oxide (M. AlMateri, et al) [23 ] and Sm3+  doped lead fluoroborate (Akshatha Wagh, et al) [3 ] glasses have been researched upon. To the authors' best knowledge, so far ZnF2 –Li2 O–BaO–Al2 O3 –B2 O3 -Sm2 O3  composition has not been reported for orange/red emission device and radiation shielding applications. Thus, keeping in mind the good rare-earth ion solubility and low cost of borate, enhancement of refractive index and optical properties by zinc fluoride and aluminium oxide, contribution of mechanical and structural stability by lithium oxide and barium oxide, the present host matrix has been selected as ZnF2 –Li2 O–BaO–Al2 O3 –B2 O3 . Further, Sm2 O3  has been doped to this host matrix from 0.1 to 1.1 mol% to investigate the physical, mechanical, structural, optical, and radiation shielding properties of the glasses.  2 Experimental procedure The following chemical composition was used to prepare five Sm3+  doped lithium zinc alumino borate glasses: 15ZnF2 –12Li2 CO3 –10BaO–8Al2 O3 –(55-x) B2 O3 –xSm2 O3  (x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.1 mol%). Methodology used for the preparation of the glass samples was conventional melt-quench technique. After the batch calculations, the precursors-ZnF2 , Li2 CO3 , BaO, Al2 O3 , B2 O3 , Sm2 O3  procured (thanks to Sigma Aldrich having presented purity of <99%) were weighed in accordance with the glass composition using Contech analytical balance with a sensitivity of 0.0001 g and mixed thoroughly using an pestle and agate mortar. The chemical powders were grinded till a homogenous mixture of composition. This homogenous chemical mixture was carried to a porcelain crucible and kept in an Indfurr Superheat electric furnace at 980 degree Celsius for duration of 2 h. Molten mass was immediately quenched on a stainless steel mould which was maintained at a temperature of 350 degree Celsius. Glasses obtained by this procedure were observed to be transparent, yellowish in color, clear and bubble-free. They were then allowed to anneal at 350 degree Celsius for 3 h on a hot pan procured with help of Indfurr Superheat furnace. They were polished with different grain size emery polishing sheets over Bainpol Chennai Metco polishing/grinding machine and diamond lubricant to the sample. The five 2 mm thick resultant transparent glass samples were coded as Sm0.1, Sm0.3, Sm0.5, Sm0.7 and Sm1.1 corresponding to 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.1 mol% of Sm2 O3  concentration respectively. Densities of the samples were determined through fluid displacement technique, i.e., Archimedes rule working with distilled water as immersion liquid. Micro indentation was carried out using Matsuzawa MMT-X7 series micro-hardness tester (Eyepiece: 10×, Magnification: 40×, Objective: 400×) on the glass samples for dwell time 15 s for evaluation of Vickers Hardness. The compositional and morphological data of the glass samples were investigated to plot the distribution of the different chemical elements in the material under Zeiss EVO 18 system. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) was applied on Rigaku Miniflex 600 X-Ray Diffractometer, with a graphite monochromator with 2θ (θ = Bragg angle) and Cu Kα radiation (40 kV & 15 mA) to be 5° to 80°. Optical absorption spectra for the investigated glasses were counted in 350–2000 nm range with resolution of 1 nm, using Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 s UV–Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Emission spectra was saved utilizing Edinburgh Spectrofluorimeter – FLS 980 with Xenon flash lamp and pulsed laser as excitation sources. For the radiation shielding part, simulation was done through XCOM software in the range of 15 keV-15 MeV, by considering the densities of the glasses [24 ].  3 Results & discussion 3.1 Physical parameters Physical parameters of the glasses like molar volume, refractive index, transmission coefficient, number density, inter-ionic distance, field strength, polaron radius, dielectric constant, molar refraction, molar polarizability, metallization criterion and reflection losses were calculated using the formulae cited in [3 ,20 ] and are tabulated in Table 1  . Density (ρ) has been measured utilizing the Archimedes principle by the expression-(1) ρ = W a  W a  − W b    ρ b     where Wa and Wb   show the weights of glass in air and distilled water respectively, and ρ b   denotes the distilled water's density (ρ b   = 0.999 g/cm3 ). It is obvious from Table 1  that the refractive index and density values continuously increased with increase in Sm2 O3  concentration. The increase in density indicated the increase in the compactness of the glass matrix which is owing to the replacement of lower mass B2 O3  with higher molar mass Sm2 O3.  The continuous decrease in the values of inter-ionic distance and polaron radius can be attributed to the increase in compactness of the glasses through successive addition of Sm3+  ions. Field strength (inversely proportional to square of polaron radius), increased with increase in Sm2 O3  content. The values of dielectric constant, molar refraction and molar polarizability are increasing, indicating that addition of Sm2 O3  has a positive impact on these quantities. Metallization criterion is the condition for deciding metallic or insulating nature. The values of metallization criterion <1, once again proved the insulating nature of the glass samples [9 ]. Reflection losses for all the samples were found to be minimum (5–6%).  3.2 Mechanical properties 3.2.1 Elasticity constants Young's modulus (E), Shear modulus (S) Poisson's ratio (ϑ) and Bulk modulus (K) have been calculated using the Makishima and Mackenzie's theory [22 ]. For a crystalline oxide the Young's modulus is given by the equation(2) E = 2 αU  r 0 3      where α, U and ro  represent the Madelung constant, the attraction electrostatic energy and inter atomic distance, respectively. As the glass structure is disordered, it is quite hard to obtain a significant Madelung constant. Makishima and Mackenzie theory has offered to take the dissociation energy of oxides per unit volume, Gt  (instead of the Madelung energy) multiplied by dimensionless term, relative to the packing density factor, Vt . Hence the Young's modulus can be given as-.(3) E = 2G t  V t  = 2  ρ M  ∑ V i   x i  ∑ G i   x i      The term Gi  can be determined by the dissociation energy per unit volume,(4) G i  = ρ i  M i   X  Δ H f  M  gas   + Y  Δ H f  O  gas   − Δ H f  M x  O y  crystal   – X + Y    RT       where ρi  is the density and Mi  denotes the molecular weight of the oxide i and ΔHf  shows the molar heat of formation from their standard states of the gaseous atoms and oxide, R and T are the gas constant and the room temperature, respectively. For the investigated glass samples, the dissociation energy of ZnF2 , BaO, Al2 O3 , Li2 CO3 , B2 O3  and Sm2 O3  is obtained by knowing the enthalpies of each component as got from the Hess's cycle [27 ]. Table 2   tabulates Gi  values calculated for each sample. If xi  is the molar fraction of the component i in the multi component glass, then.(5) G t  = ∑ G i  x i      To estimate the Vt  term of Mx Oy  oxide glass, it is necessary to compute the individual density factor Vi  of each oxide first, using(6) V i  = 4 Π N A   3   xr M  3  + yr O  3       where NA  is Avogadro number, rM  and rO  are the ionic radii of the cation and anion, respectively. Thus, the total packing density factor can be written by-(7) V t  = ρ M  ∑ V i  x i      Bulk modulus for glass can be semi-empirically defined as following relation:(8) K = 1.2  V t   E = 2.4  V t  2   G     Shear modulus (S) is calculated by the equation-(9) S = 3 EK  9 K − E       Poisson's ratio (ϑ) by-(10) ϑ = E 2 S − 1       The estimated Young's modulus (E), Poisson's ratio (ϑ), Bulk modulus (K) and Shear modulus (S) of all the glasses are indicated in Table 3  . The high v alues for these quantities indicated a good mechanical stability of the glasses.  3.2.2 Vickers micro-hardness test Micro-indentation was carried out on each sample for loads of 50, 100, 300, 500 and 1000 g force and the calculated values of hardness are tabulated in Table 4  . A plot of hardness (GPa) v/s load (g) with error bars is represented in Fig. 1  . It is clearly evident from Fig. 1  that the hardness values continuously increased with increase in load, indicating the increase in the reaction of these glasses against the applied loads.   3.3 Structural properties 3.3.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) Study of composition and surface morphology was done through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDAX). Figs. 2 & 3    refer to SEM image and EDAX spectra respectively of 0.7Sm glass sample. Silver sputtering of the sample was done for a good metallic contact during the experiment. SEM image gives the information that the surface is homogenous and smooth. EDAX spectrum confirmed the presence of all added chemicals in the glass matrix except lithium and boron which have lower atomic number. Observed silicon may be from crucible contamination. Presence of silver is due to the silver sputtering on the sample.  3.3.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) Fig. 4   indicates overlaid XRD profiles recorded from Sm doped lithium zinc alumino borate glasses in the range 5° to 80°. The lack of sharp diffraction peaks and a broad diffracted peak around 2θ = 20° to 35° in each XRD profile, confirmed the amorphous nature for the prepared glasses [28 ].   3.4 Optical properties 3.4.1 UV–Vis-NIR absorption spectra UV–Vis-NIR spectra exhibited 7 absorption peaks from spin orbit and electrostatic interactions of 4f-4f energy level transitions from the ground 6 H5/2  to several excited states namely 4 D3/2 , 6 P7/2 , 6 P3/2 , 6 P5/2 , 4 I13/2 , 4 M15/2  + 4 I11/2 , 4 G5/2  observed at around 361 nm, 373 nm, 401 nm, 414 nm, 461 nm, 475 nm and 563 nm respectively in the UV–visible region [29 ] (Fig. 5  ). In the NIR region, 7 absorption peaks were observed corresponding to transitions from the ground 6 H5/2  state to 6 F11/2 ,6 F9/2 ,6 F7/2 ,6 F5/2 ,6 F3/2 , 6 H15/2  and 6 F1/2  at around 937 nm, 1075 nm, 1223 nm, 1365 nm, 1468 nm, 1516 nm and 1587 nm [29 ] (Fig. 6  ). Nephelauxetic ratio (β) of the recorded absorption bands can be calculated by(11) β = ϑ B  ϑ C      where ϑ C   and ϑ B   denote wavenumbers (cm−1 ) of aqua ion and chosen prominent absorption bands in the glass, respectively [3 ]. To evaluate bonding parameter δ , mean value of Nephelauxetic ratio, β ¯    has been utilized as(12) δ = 1 − β ¯    β ¯        The negative or positive values of δ  decide the ionic or covalent bonding between rare earth ion and its surrounding ligand within the glassy framework. Negative value of δ  is observed (Table 5  ) signifying the ionic bond between samarium ions and the surrounding ligands [3 ,7 ]. Optical energy band gap of the glasses was calculated using(13) α ν  =  B hν − Eopt     r  hν     where α(ν ) represents the absorption coefficient, hν denotes photon energy, Eopt  shows the energy of optical band gap, r represents the index number (r  = 1/2 and 2 for direct and indirect allowed transitions, respectively) and B shows the band tailing quantity. The method employed to calculate the optical band gap was by extrapolating the linear region of the curves to the zero absorption at (αhν)1/2  = 0. An illustration of Tauc's plot for Sm1.1 sample is shown in Fig. 7  . The observed values of indirect band gap are 3.00, 3.02, 3.01, 3.03 and 3.04 eV for Sm0.1, Sm0.3, Sm0.5, Sm0.7 and Sm1.1 confirming the insulating nature of these glasses, respectively.   3.5 Photoluminescence (PL) study 3.5.1 Excitation spectra Fig. 8   illustrates overlaid excitation spectra of the samarium doped lithium zinc alumino borate glasses recorded by keeping the emission at 598 nm. The spectra represented various prominent transitions at 344 nm, 361 nm, 375 nm, 401 nm, 416 nm, 438 nm and 475 nm assigned to 6 H5/2 → 4 D7/2 , 6 H5/2 → 4 D3/2 , 6 H5/2  → 6 P7/2 , 6 H5/2  → 4 P3/2 , 6 H5/2  → 6 P5/2 , 6 H5/2  → 4 G9/2  and 6 H5/2  → 4 I13/2  + 4 I11/2  respectively. The prominent excitation peak at 401 nm corresponding to 6 H5/2  → 4 P3/2  transition was chosen for the measurement of emission spectra. At 401 nm excitation wavelength, Sm3+  ions are excited to the energy lev el 6 P3/2  and rapidly relax through non-radiative transition to the energy level 4 G5/2  [1 ].   3.5.2 Emission spectra Fig. 9   indicates overlaid emission spectra of the glass samples. The spectra consisted of the four well-known bands at 562 nm, 598 nm, 644 nm and 710 nm corresponding to 4 G5/2  → 6 H5/2 , 4 G5/2  → 6 H7/2 , 4 G5/2  → 6 H9/2 , 4 G5/2  → 6 H11/2  transitions respectively. Out of four emission peaks, host dependent hypersensitive 4 G5/2  → 6 H7/2  transition allowed by ∆J = 2 selection rule indicated intense emission band at 598 nm. This orange-red emission is used in LEDs, undersea communication and solid state lasers applications. Moreover, this emission is not affected by multi-phonon non-radiative decay. This is because the energy difference between the emission level and the next lower level is quite greater than the phonon energy of borate glasses[8 ]. Fig. 10   shows the plot of PL intensity v/s samarium concentration for 4 G5/2 →6 H7/2  transition. The plot revealed that Sm0.3 glass showed highest luminescence when compared to other studied glasses. Above 0.3 mol% concentration of Sm3+  ions, luminescence intensity was quenched due to the collision of samarium ions in the excited states [1 ].  3.5.3 Evaluation of color coordinates Quality of the color radiated by any matter is quantitatively evaluated through colorimetry. It can be described by utilizing the mathematical functions named color matching in the 1931 CIE (Commission International de l'Eclairage France) chromaticity diagram (Fig. 11  ). The diagram displays all the chromaticity visible to the human eye. Perimeter of the diagram indicates the mono-chromatic light sources while the location of white light is at the center with (0.33, 0.33) coordinates [2 ]. The color of any light source can be described by three variables x ¯   (λ), ӯ(λ) and z (  ¯   λ), which are in dimensionless and color matching functions. For a given power-spectral density P(λ), the degree of stimulation needs to match the color of P(λ) which is written as below [30 ]-(14) X = ∫ λ  x ¯  λ   P λ   dλ    (15) Y = ∫ λ  y ¯  λ   P λ   dλ    (16) Z = ∫ λ  z ¯  λ   P λ   dλ    where X, Y and Z denote the tristimulus values used to get the stimulation (i.e. power) for each of the three primary colors required to match the color P(λ). Utilizing the tristin values of emission spectra, chromaticity coordinates x and y is estimated through the following relations:(17) x = X X + Y + Z      (18) y = Y X + Y + Z       The calculated values of chromaticity co-ordinates (x, y) of the Sm3+  doped lithium zinc alumino borate glasses are tabulated in Table 6  . In the diagram, chromaticity coordinates (x, y) clustered in the orange-red region that make the Sm3+  doped lithium zinc alumino borate glasses a suitable candidate for applications in orange-red emission devices like LEDs and solid state lasers.   3.6 Radiation shielding properties If glass has to be used in radiation shielding, composition of the glass, its density and the photon energy of incident radiation play an important role. The density of the glass sample has important effects on the attenuation of the incident gamma photons, where denser glass sample possesses better shielding factures than lighter one. To estimate the radiation shielding characteristics for the present glasses, mass attenuation coefficient (μ/ρ) was determined through Bragg's law-(19) μ / ρ   glass  = ∑ i  w i  μ / ρ   i      where the subscript i is the elements used in the glass fabrication (i.e. Li, B, O, F, Zn, Al, Ba and Sm) and wi  denotes its fraction by weight. The μ/ρ for these elements has been obtained from XCOM program [25 ] between 15 keV and 15 MeV and we calculated the μ/ρ for the prepared samples with different concentration of Sm2 O3  and the results are plotted in Fig. 12  . The trend in the μ/ρ for the ZnF2 –Li2 O–BaO–Al2 O3 –B2 O3 –Sm2 O3  composition is similar to the results reported by Dong et al. [26 ] who studied the attenuation behavior of lithium zinc bismuth borate glasses at some energies between 15 keV and 10 MeV. Moreover, the shape of the curve presented in Fig. 12  is similar to the μ/ρ curve reported by Singh et al. [27 ] who applied the WinXcom program to search the gamma photons attenuation characterization of borate and silicate heavy metal oxide glass samples. A general observation of Fig. 12  represents that the values of μ/ρ depend upon the concentration of Sm2 O3  and the energy of the photon. The variation in μ/ρ with the energy for all prepared samples with different Sm2 O3  content is nearly the same. As shown in Fig. 12 , the μ/ρ for the Sm0.1, Sm0.3, Sm0.5, Sm0.7 and Sm1.1 samples are somewhat high at the low energies (about 25 cm2 /g at 15 keV), then decreases fast with the increase in the energy except at 0.04 MeV, where there is a small peak. The present μ/ρ behavior for the ZnF2 –Li2 O–BaO–Al2 O3 –B2 O3 –Sm2 O3  glasses is related to the photon-matter interaction mechanisms. In brief, gamma photons can interact with the glass sample depending upon the content of the sample and the photon energy in different ways; the most important being the photoelectric absorption effect (which is important for the photons with low energy), Compton scattering and pair production (occurs for the photons having energy larger than 1.022 MeV) [28 ]. It is known that the photoelectric absorption depends on both the atomic number and the energy as Z4–5  and E-3.5  respectively. We can observe from Fig. 12  that for all samples, the attenuation values are first high and then reduce quickly. For example, for the Sm0.1 sample the μ/ρ is 22.31 cm2 /g at 15 keV, while this value reduces to 10.28 cm2 /g at 20 keV. The same was noticed for the Sm0.3, Sm0.5, Sm0.7 and Sm1.1 samples. This indicates that the samples have good attenuation ability at low energy and this ability to attenuate the photon decreases with further increase in the energy. Besides, as illustrated in Fig. 12  with increasing Sm2 O3  concentration from 0.1 to 1.1 mol%, the μ/ρ increases at all energies except between 0.8 and 2 MeV where all samples seem to have the same values. This is becuase the Compton scattering is the main interaction process between these energies and the cross section of this process depnds upon the atomic number, Z. The same trend in μ/ρ in the Compoton scattering region was observed for tellurite glasses [29 ]. The increase in the μ/ρ with the addition of the Sm2 O3  is owing to the replacement of lighter atom (B, Z = 5) in the glass structure by the heavier atom (Sm, Z = 62). The small peak observed in the μ/ρ curve was due to the K-absorption edges of the two heavy elements present in the glass structure namely Ba and Sm which occur at 37.44 keV (for Ba) and 46.83 keV (for Sm) and hence the peak at 0.04 MeV. The data from the μ/ρ curves showed that the Sm1.1 sample has the highest μ/ρ values, which implies that this sample possess better shielding features since it can absorb more photons than the rest. The effective atomic number (Zeff ) is a concept utilized to estimate the photon attenuation characterization for a specific material. It represents the fraction of total number of electrons in a sample in photon - atom interaction. For the ZnF2 –Li2 O–BaO–Al2 O3 –B2 O3 –Sm2 O3  glass system, the next equation was used for Zeff  calculations as-(20) Z eff  = ∑ i  f i  A i  μ ρ   i   ∑ j  f j  A j  Z j   μ ρ   j        where f,  Z and A are the fractional abundance, the atomic number, and the atomic weight, respectively. By using the μ/ρ values presented in Fig. 12  and with the help of the previous relation, we evaluated the Zeff  for the samples under study and exhibited the results in Fig. 13  . It is found that the Zeff  has maximum values at low energies (photoelectric effect region), whereas in the Compton scattering region, the Zeff  reaches minimum values and the variation of Zeff  with the energy is insignificant. The data shown in Fig. 13  also showed that the Zeff  increases slightly for E > 3 MeV and this is owing to the pair production process, as discussed previously by different researchers [30−32]. Moreover, the Zeff  for 15ZnF2 –12Li2 O–10BaO–8Al2 O3 –(55-x)B2 O3 –xSm2 O3  glass samples were found in the range 9.27–41.62, 9.33–41.75, 9.39–41.88, 9.45–42.01 and 9.75–42.27 for x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.1 mol% respectively. It is observed from Fig. 13  that the Zeff  increases as the amount of Sm2 O3  content increases from 0.1 to 1.1 mol%. The increase in Zeff  is due to replacement of lighter B2 O3  by the significantly heavier Sm2 O3 . Therefore, from Zeff  curve we can see that Sm1.1 sample has the highest Zeff  values among the prepared samples and this implies that Sm1.1 sample is the better gamma radiation attenuator than Sm0.1-Sm0.7 samples. The Half Value Layer (HVL) is a quantity that characterizes the interaction between gamma photons with the glass sample. It provides an estimate about the shielding efficiency of the sample against radiation. It is defined as that thickness of a sample at which the transmitted intensity of the photon is exactly 50% the incident photon intensity. HVL of each glass was evaluated by using the relationship-(21) HVL = 0.693 μ       The HVL as a function of energy for the prepared 15ZnF2 –12Li2 O–10BaO–8Al2 O3 –(55-x)B2 O3 –xSm2 O3  glasses is plotted in Fig. 14  . Evidently, the values of HVL for all samples increase as the energy increases, as expected based on the μ/ρ curve shown in Fig. 12 . It is well known that the higher HVL for a sample suggests more distance the photon can move inside the sample. Hence, shorter HVL values for specific samples are preferable to obtain better photon attenuator. Perusal of the data presented in Fig. 14 , it is obvious that HVL decreases with the addition of Sm2 O3 . The HVL is inversely related to the density of the sample and this explains the reduction in HVL with more amount of Sm2 O3 . Mean Free Path (MFP) is a term which plays a critical role in evaluating the attenuation of gamma photons in a medium. As in the case of HVL, the MFP is energy dependent parameter, where increasing the energy of the photon causes an increase in the MFP value. For practical applications, lower MFP is preferable, since lower MFP implies more photons interaction with the sample and hence giving shorter distance between two interactions. MFP is equal to the reciprocal of the linear attenuation coefficient (i.e. MFP = 1/μ). We calculated the MFP for the Sm0.1-Sm1.1 samples and plotted the results in Fig. 15   The MFP behavior is similar to the behavior shown for the HV L. From Fig. 15  there is a noticeable reducing order in the MFP from sample Sm0.1 to sample Sm1.1. Overall, the addition of Sm2 O3  improves the attenuation ability of the 15ZnF2 –12Li2 O–10BaO–8Al2 O3 –(55-x)B2 O3 –xSm2 O3  glasses against gamma photons.   4 Conclusion Present work explores the physical, mechanical, structural, optical and radiation shielding properties of Sm3+  doped lithium zinc alumino borate glass samples. UV –Vis-NIR absorption spectra showed all possible transitions of Sm3+  ions in the lithium zinc alumino borate glass matrix. Bonding parameter value signified ionic bond between Sm3+  ion and surrounding ligands. XRD approved the amorphous nature for the glasses. High values of elastic moduli proved the good mechanical stability of the glasses. Luminescence quenching effect was observed beyond 0.3 mol% Sm2 O3  concentration. The color chromaticity study proved the suitability of Sm3+  doped lithium zinc alumino borate glasses in orange/red LEDs and solid-state lasers. The addition of Sm2 O3  improved the attenuation ability of the lithium borate glasses against gamma photons. Thus, the present glasses in the study have potential as orange/red emission device and radiation shields.    References [1] S. Thomas  G. Rani  S.N. Rasool  M.

                  Ho3+ substituted cobalt-zinc ferrite with a chemical formula Co0.7Zn0.3HoxFe2−xO4 (0≤x≤0.1) were synthesized by sol-gel method. Synthesized samples were characterized by using X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, Raman, Infrared and UV–visible spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction patterns show the formation of cubic spinel structure of all the synthesized samples. The gradual changes in the Raman spectra of Co-Zn ferrite were observed at higher level of Ho3+ substitution. The Raman band shows that there is a strong electron-phonon coupling in the investigated ferrite system and is the highest for the T

                      modes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shows that the vibration bands corresponding to Fe–O is slightly varied with the substitution of Ho3+ substitution. UV–visible spectra was studied by using the optical absorbance measurements in the wavelength ranges from 500 to 800nm. The estimated energy band gap is found to increase from 1.72 to 1.84eV with the increase in Ho3+ substitution. The elastic properties such as longitudinal velocity, shearing velocity, elastic constant, Poisson's ratio and Debye temperature were measured at room temperature by using the ultrasonic pulse transmission method. It is found that the elastic constant and Debye temperature decreased with the increase in Ho3+ substitution. A linear relationship between Debye temperature, elastic constant and average sound velocity with the Ho3+ substitution is observed and discussed in this manuscript. Dielectric properties have been investigated as function of frequency. The dispersion of the dielectric properties was discussed in the light of Koop's theory in accordance with the Maxwell-Wagner polarization.

Ho3+  substituted cobalt-zinc ferrite with a chemical formula Co0.7 Zn0.3 Hox Fe2−x O4  (0≤x≤0.1) were synthesized by sol-gel method. Synthesized samples were characterized by using X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, Raman, Infrared and UV–visible spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction patterns show the formation of cubic spinel structure of all the synthesized samples. The gradual changes in the Raman spectra of Co-Zn ferrite were observed at higher level of Ho3+  substitution. The Raman band shows that there is a strong electron-phonon coupling in the investigated ferrite system and is the highest for the T 3  2g   mode as compared to A 1g   and T 2  2g   modes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shows that the vibration bands corresponding to Fe–O is slightly varied with the substitution of Ho3+  substitution. UV–visible spectra was studied by using the optical absorbance measurements in the wavelength ranges from 500 to 800 nm. The estimated energy band gap is found to increase from 1.72 to 1.84 eV with the increase in Ho3+  substitution. The elastic properties such as longitudinal velocity, shearing velocity, elastic constant, Poisson's ratio and Debye temperature were measured at room temperature by using the ultrasonic pulse transmission method. It is found that the elastic constant and Debye temperature decreased with the increase in Ho3+  substitution. A linear relationship between Debye temperature, elastic constant and average sound velocity with the Ho3+  substitution is observed and discussed in this manuscript. Dielectric properties have been investigated as function of frequency. The dispersion of the dielectric properties was discussed in the light of Koop's theory in accordance with the Maxwell-Wagner polarization.   Keywords Ferrites  Raman spectra  IR spectra  Optical properties  Elastic properties  Debye dielectric properties    1 Introduction The fabrication of nano-ferrites has received a paramount interest due to their complex fundamental properties as well as their technological applications in recording media, biomedicine, microwave absorbing materials, senor etc. The Co-Zn ferrite is an important microwave absorbing material because of its remarkable electric properties [1,2] . The Co-Zn ferrite has also been extensively studied because of their high dielectric constant, high magnetic permeability, and remarkable chemical stability [3,4] . This material is also known for its excellent corrosion resistance, chemical stability and high abrasion resistance [5,6] . Considering all these properties; Co-Zn ferrite could be a good infrared radiant material that may be useful in various fields, such as infrared emission and infrared health. These properties can be investigated by employing Raman and IR spectroscopy [7] . Raman spectroscopy is a useful tool to characterize the corrosion products on a wide range of materials, both as an ex-situ  technique [8–10]  and to examine films in-situ [11] . The spinel structure has the space group Fd3m  (OFh), and a factor group analysis by White and De Angelis [12]  predicts 5 Raman active internal modes; Alg +Eg +3T2g . Analysis of the tensor components will therefore identify each Raman active vibration. If the Raman modes have been identified correctly then it should be possible to comment on the compositional dependence of the mode frequencies that generally reflect the site occupancies. Spinel ferrite has a general formula AB2 O4 [13,14]  that can also be represented as (A1−x Bx )tet [Ax B2−x ]oct O4 , where tetrahedral (A)- and octahedral [B]-sites are mainly occupied by divalent and trivalent cations [15–19] . FT-IR spectroscopy is an important tool to study the local structure and optical properties of ferrite that include optical band gaps which is important from the technological point of view. FT-IR study can also be useful to evaluate the elastic properties of ferrites that have a great importance to evaluate the nature of inter-atomic and inter-ionic forces between the cations present in ferrites. The elastic properties are also helpful to study thermal properties like specific heat and Debye temperature which are important in order to decide the suitability of ferrites for proper industrial applications. Apart from elastic properties, investigation of dielectric properties such as dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent also provides precious information for localized charge carrier and mechanism of dielectric polarization. The remarkable optical, elastic and dielectric properties are dependent on the ions, their charges and their distribution of cation in A and B sites. Various ions can be incorporated into the ferrites in order to change the properties of ferrites. Ho3+  ion is especially interesting because of its variable electronic structure and electric properties. The partial substitution of high spin transition metal ions (3d elements) and the rare earth ions (4f elements) for Fe3+  ions in ferrites exhibit a strong spin-orbital (3d–4f) coupling. The aim of the present work is to study the Raman and IR spectroscopy for optical and elastic properties along with dielectric properties of Ho3+  substituted Co-Zn ferrite.  2 Experimental details 2.1 Synthesization of Co0.7 Zn0.3 Hox Fe2−x O4  Nano crystalline spinel ferrites were synthesized by using the metal nitrates of constituent elements such as Co(NO3 )2 ·6H2 O, Zn(NO3 )2 ·6H2 O, Ho(NO3 )3 ·5H2 O, Fe(NO3 )3 ·9H2 O and citric acid (C6  H8 O7 H2 O). These raw materials were first weighed according to the prescribed compound ratios and then dissolved in 100 ml water. This solution was subjected to continuous stirring at 100 °C to obtain a homogeneous solution. The molar ratio of nitrates to citric acid was kept as 1:3. Drop wise ammonia hydroxide was added to the mixed solution to adjust the pH around 7. The mixed solution was kept on to a hot plate with continuous stirring at 100 °C. Finally all water molecules were evaporated from the solution and the viscous gel began foaming. After few minutes the gel automatically ignited and burns with glowing flints. The auto combustion was completed within a minute, yielding a brown colored ash termed as precursor. The as prepared powders were annealed at 700 °C for 4 h to get the final product. The chemical reaction may occur according to the following equation:1·4Co(NO3 )2 ·6H2 O+0·6Zn(NO3 )2 ·6H2 O+4Fe(NO3 )3 ·9H2 O+4C6 H8 O7 H2 O+2O2 →2Co0·7 Zn0·3 Fe2 O4  +56H2 O↑ +4CO2 ↑ +4N↑ +16NO2 ↑      2.2 Characterizations Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by using X- ray diffractometer (Model Bruker D8) employed with CuKα irradiation (λ=1.5405 Ǻ). Rietveld refinements of XRD patterns were performed using FullProf program. The surface morphology of the typical samples was observed by the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Raman spectra of all the prepared samples were obtained at room temperature by using a commercial spectrometer (Horiba Jobin-Yvon Lab RAM HR) equipped with a CCD detector. The 532 nm line from an Argon ion laser was used to illuminate the samples at 5 mW power. IR spectra of ferrites were recorded using infrared spectrometer (Bruker) in the 400–1400 cm−1  spectral range. The absorption measurements were carried out using UV–visible spectrometer in order to determine the optical properties of prepared samples. The UV–Visible absorbance was recorded using Elico double beam (Model SL191) UV–Visible spectrophotometer to estimate the band gap energy. The elastic properties of all the samples were determined by ultrasonic pulse transmission (UTP) interferometer method at room temperature. The interferometer were operated at 124.6 kHz and equipped with PZT crystal for calibration having an accuracy of ±5 m/s in the velocity measurements. Frequency dependent dielectric measurements were carried out on Hioki 3532-50 LCR-Q meter operated at room temperature in the frequency range of 50 Hz–5 MHz.   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure and morphology Phase purity and crystal structure of all the prepared samples were investigated by using x-ray diffraction technique. The atomic occupancy of metal ions at A and B sites of spinel ferrites is carried out by Rietveld refinement using Full-prof software. Rietveld refined XRD of the typical samples with end compositions (x=0.0 and 0.1) of Co0.7 Zn0.3 Hox Fe2−x O4  (hereafter refer as CZHFO) are presented in  Fig. 1 . XRD pattern for x=0.0 (Co0.7 Zn0.3 Fe2 O4 ) shows that the sample posses single phase of cubic spinel structure with a space group of Fd3m , whereas in case of x=0.1 (Co0.7 Zn0.3 Ho0.1 Fe1.9 O4 ) a secondary phase of Ho3+  is observed. This shows that the higher concentration of Ho3+  ions do not get accommodated in the spinel lattice structure due to the higher ionic radii of rare earth (Ho3+ ) ion. The CZHFO ferrite samples were examined by FE-SEM to study the surface morphology and to confirm the phase structure of the prepared samples ( Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 (a) and (b) shows the FE-SEM micrographs of the typical samples of x=0.025 and x=0.05. It is observed from FE-SEM micrographs that the grains are in regular size with a rather homogeneous grain. The grain size is laid in the range of 30–41 nm, however the shape and size of the most of the grains are almost independent of the Ho3+  substitution. The bulk density of annealed samples was determined by Archimedes's method and by using the relation:(1) d  B   = ( W  a    W  a   − W  w      )   g / c m  3        where Wa  and Ww  is the weight of sample in air and water respectively. The density of water is 1 g/cm3  at room temperature (30 °C). Values of bulk density are presented in  Table 1 , that shows decreasing trend with increase in Ho3+  substitution. In the present ferrite system, molecular weight and unit volume of Co-Zn ferrite increased with increase in Ho substitution, which resulted in increase in the unit cell over the molecular weight.  3.2 Raman spectra Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique to reveal the structural properties of ferrites. The mixed ferrite structure is having the Oh 7 (Fd3m ) space group which gives 39 Raman modes, however out of 39 modes, only 5 Raman modes are active in spinel ferrites which is mainly attributed to the motion of oxygen ion at A site [20,21] .  Fig. 3  shows the Raman spectra of all the samples of CZHFO. Three major broad bands and other two minor modes with less intense peak are seen in all the samples. Values of wave number of these bands are listed in Table 1 . The observed five bands can be assigned to Raman spectra in active optical modes (1A1g +1Eg +3T2g ) which is a characteristic feature of cubic spinel structure [22,23] . The A1g  mode is due to the symmetric stretching of oxygen atoms along Fe–O (and Zn–O) bonds in the tetrahedral sites. The Eg mode is a result of the symmetric bending of oxygen atom with respect to the metal ions. The T2g (2) and T2g (3) modes are corresponding to the vibrations of the octahedral group. Raman modes appeared in the 630–700 cm−1  wavelength region is corresponding to of tetrahedral A-site metal ions in ferrites, whereas Raman modes observed in the 310–610 cm−1  region are corresponding to the nature of metal ions at octahedral B-site. It can be noticed from Fig. 3  and Table 1  that the frequency of bands was slightly changed with Ho substitution. The change in band wavelength is referred to the distribution of divalent and trivalent cations among the available A and B sites, and the migration of cations from A to B site and vice versa.  3.3 Infrared analysis Chemical and structural changes were examined by IR spectra analysis ( Fig. 4 ). According to the Kirchhoff's law [24] , the ratio of emissivity and absorption is a function of emission wavelengths and temperature, where the nature of matter has no obvious effect on it. However, it is proportional to the absorption coefficient and the high absorption capability will lead to high emission ability. Fig. 4  shows the two major absorption bands namely v 1  and v 2  and they are assigned to the intrinsic vibrations of A and B site cations respectively. Similar IR spectra of the rare earth Pr substituted cobalt ferrite were reported in the literature [25] . The high frequency absorption bands (v 1 ) is appeared in the range of 700–725 cm−1  whereas lower frequency absorption band (v 2 ) is appeared in the range of 425–450 cm−1 . The wave-number position of vibrational frequency is presented in  Table 2 . It is observed from Table 2  that the frequency of bands for different level of Ho3+  substitution is slightly changed and may be related to the occupancy of cation in A and B sites. The ionic radius of Ho3+  ion is greater than Fe3+  ions in the B-site, which indicates that the Ho3+  ions were occupied by the octahedral B-site [26,27] . The substitution of Ho3+  ions with higher radius and atomic weight as compared to Fe3+  ions pushes Fe3+  ions to A-site which resulted in increase in the octahedral vibration frequency (v 2 ). The Zn2+  ions at A-site have smaller radius as compared to Ho3+  ions and lower atomic weight compared to Fe3+  ions, which causes in increase in the vibrational frequency [28–31] . The force constant (k) is related to the frequency of vibrational mode (v ) and is calculated using the following relation:(2) υ = 1 2 π c   k m        where c is the velocity of light, v  is the frequency of vibrational mode, m is corresponding to mass of the vibrating atoms and k is force constant. The force constant for the tetrahedral site (kt ) and octahedral site (ko) was determined using the position of v 1  and v 2  bands. Values of kt  and kO  are listed in Table 2  and it is found that force constants were increased with Ho substitution. This increase in force constants may be related the weakling of interatomic bonding.  3.4 UV–visible spectra The absorbance spectra of all the prepared samples are shown in  Fig. 5  that show a high absorbance at ultraviolet region which gradually decreased in the visible /near infrared region. The absorption coefficient (α) was determined in the fundamental absorption region using Lambert law [32] :(3) L n ( I  0    I   )  = 2.303 A = α d     (4) α = 2.303 A  d      where Io and I are the intensity of incident and transmitted light respectively, A is the optical absorbance and d is the thickness of sample.  Fig. 6  shows the variation of absorption coefficient with photon energy for all the samples under investigation. It can be observed that all the samples posses high value of absorption coefficient (α=104  cm−1 ), which increase the probability of occurrence of direct transitions. The optical band gap (Eg ) is given by the following equation:(5) α h ν = A ( h ν − E  g    )  n      where hυ is the photon energy, Eg is the band gap energy, A is a constant and ‘n’ depends on the nature of the transition. The value of n is 2 for indirect electronic transition (indirect band gap) and 1/2 for direct electronic transition (direct band gap). To determine the direct and indirect band gaps of the materials, (αhν)2  were plotted against photon energy (hν) and its variation is shown in  Fig. 7 (a) and (b). Values of direct and indirect band gaps were estimated by intercepting the X-axis where the linear portion of the graphs was extrapolated. The calculated values of indirect band gap of the presently investigated samples are ranging from 1.72 to 1.84 eV. Further, it is observed that the value of indirect band gap is increased with the increase in Ho substitution. The observed value of indirect band gap of Co0.7 Zn0.3 Fe2 O4  ferrite is 1.72 eV which is in close agreement with the average value of CoFe2 O4  (1.17 eV) [33]  and ZnFe2 O4  (2.2 eV) [34] .  3.5 Elastic properties Elastic properties can be defined into two terms such as elastic constant and/or elastic moduli that refer to the solid elongation or compression in various directions. Values of ultrasonic wave velocity are depicted in  Fig. 8 . It is observed from Fig. 8  that the longitudinal (VL ), shearing (Vs ) and mean (Vm ) velocities were decreased with increase in Ho substitution. The value of shearing velocity is less than that of longitudinal velocity. This may be due to the fact that when a wave travels through a material, it makes the particles of the material to vibrate due to the transfer of energy. The vibrating particles collide with other particles that resulted in other particles to vibrate. This results in reduction of energy of the ultrasonic waves. In case of shear waves, the particle in a medium vibrates perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave motion, and hence it requires a larger energy to make the neighboring particle vibrate [35] . It is observed from  Table 3  that both the velocities were decreased with increase in Ho substitution which is due to the bonding force between atoms. Elastic moduli such as longitudinal (L), young (E), rigidity (G) and bulk (K) modulus were calculated by using the relation discussed elsewhere [35] . Poission ratio (σ) was calculated using the following equations:(6) σ = E 2 G   − 1      It was observed from Table 3  that σ has a constant value around 0.25. This value lies in the range of 1–0.05 which is in accordance with the theory of isotropic elasticity. It is observed from  Fig. 9  that the value of elastic moduli decreased with increase in Ho substitution. The decrease in elastic moduli is in accordance with the Wooster work [36] . This behavior is due to the weakening of inter-atomic bonding between the various atoms in the present ferrite system. The inter-atomic bonding between the various atoms becomes continuously weaker with the Ho substitution. Anderson's formula [37]  were used to calculate the Debye temperature (θD ) which depends on the physical parameters such as elastic constant and mean velocity. Debye temperature listed in Table 3  decreased with the Ho substitution which may be due to the decrease in rigidity of modulus. This decrease in Debye temperature indicate that the all the modes of vibration present in Co-Zn ferrites decreased with Ho substitution.  3.6 Dielectric properties Frequency dependent dielectric properties of spinel ferrites are contributed by the atomic electronic polarization and affected by grain size, density and impurities of samples. The variation of dielectric constant (ϵ′) with frequency of all the samples is shown in  Fig. 10 . The dielectric constant decreased with increases in frequency. The decrease in dielectric constant was rapid at lower frequency and remains almost constant at higher frequency. The observed dispersion at lower frequency is due to space charge effect and can be explain on the basis of Koops phenomenological theory [38]  in accordance with dielectric structure represented by Maxwell-Wagner type of polarization [39] . The decrease in dielectric constant at lower frequency is due to permittivity and is directly proportional to square root of conductivity. Beyond a certain higher frequency the electronic exchange between Fe3+  and Fe2+  ions cannot follow the applied frequency and thus do not affect the dielectric constant much. This behavior of dielectric constant may be explained by mechanism of the polarization process in ferrite which is similar to that of the conduction process [40] . The value of dielectric constant observed at lower frequency (100 Hz) for the different substitution level of Ho in Co-Zn ferrite is presented in the inset of Fig. 10 . It is observed that dielectric constant of Co-Zn ferrite increased with Ho substitution. Dielectric constant can also be related to the grain size and impurities of samples, however in the present case it may be related to the secondary phase of HoFeO3  present in the Co-Zn ferrite samples. The dielectric loss tangent (tan δ) was measured at room temperature in the frequency range of 50 Hz–5 MHz. The variation in tan δ as function of frequency and Ho substitution are shown in  Fig. 11 . It can be noticed from Fig. 11  that tan δ exhibit a peaking behavior at a certain frequency (fo ). The magnified image is shown in the inset of Fig. 11  showing the peak variation in tan δ with frequency. The value of tan δ at this frequency is maximum which indicates that the energy is stored in the sample at this frequency is minimum [41] . The peaking behavior in tan δ is referring to the relaxation phenomenon that observed when the hopping frequency is approximately equal to the externally applied electric field [41–43] . The relaxation time (τ) was calculated using the hopping frequency (f 0  ) and the calculated values of τ are τ=2.18×10−3  s, 1.99×10−3  s and 7.22×10−4  s for x=0.05, 0.075 and 0.1 respectively.   4 Conclusions Ho3+  substituted Co-Zn ferrite nanoparticles were successfully synthesized via sol-gel combustion route. Raman and infrared spectroscopy confirmed the formation of cubic spinel structure with Oh7(Fd 3m ) space group. Frequency of Raman modes shows systematic increase with the substitution of Ho3+  ions. Raman spectra also confirm the occupation of Ho3+  ions at octahedral B- site, though higher level of Ho3+  substitution destroy the lattice cubic symmetry of Co-Zn ferrite. IR spectra shows two major absorption bands ⎕(ν1  and ν2 ) corresponding to tetrahedral and octahedral site. UV-vis spectra show the increase in indirect band gap from 1.72 to 1.84 eV due to increase in Ho substitution. The elastic moduli of all the samples decreased with increase in Ho substitution, whereas Poisson's ratio remains almost constant for all the studied samples. Dielectric constant increased with the increase in Ho substitution and decreased with increase in applied frequency. A peaking behavior in the dielectric loss tangent is observed at a certain frequency that confirmed the relaxation phenomenon in all the samples.

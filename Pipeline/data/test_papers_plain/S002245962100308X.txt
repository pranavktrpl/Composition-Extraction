                  A novel carbon-rich B–C compounds B2C3 in orthorhombic phase is proposed in this work. Firstly, the stability of B2C3 has been demonstrated, the thermodynamic stability, dynamic stability, and mechanical stability of B2C3 are confirmed by the formation enthalpies, phonon spectra and elastic constants, respectively. As a semiconductor material with indirect band gap, B2C3 has a larger mechanical anisotropy in Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and shear modulus by three-dimensional distribution and two-dimensional representation, while in some main planes, the mechanical anisotropy in Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and shear modulus of B2C3 are slightly smaller than that of other B–C compounds. In addition, B2C3 shows negative Poisson's ratio in (111), (100), (010), and (001) planes, which can supply more potential areas to be used than other boron carbide compounds.

A novel carbon-rich B–C compounds B2 C3  in orthorhombic phase is proposed in this work. Firstly, the stability of B2 C3  has been demonstrated, the thermodynamic stability, dynamic stability, and mechanical stability of B2 C3  are confirmed by the formation enthalpies, phonon spectra and elastic constants, respectively. As a semiconductor material with indirect band gap, B2 C3  has a larger mechanical anisotropy in Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and shear modulus by three-dimensional distribution and two-dimensional representation, while in some main planes, the mechanical anisotropy in Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and shear modulus of B2 C3  are slightly smaller than that of other B–C compounds. In addition, B2 C3  shows negative Poisson's ratio in (111), (100), (010), and (001) planes, which can supply more potential areas to be used than other boron carbide compounds.   Graphical abstract The crystal structure of B2 C3  (left) and the negative Poisson’s ratio of B2 C3  in (001), (010), (011), (100), (101), (110), and (111) planes (right).Image 1       Keywords Carbon-rich B–C compounds  Semiconductor  Mechanical anisotropy  Negative Poisson's ratio    1 Introduction Elements or compounds made of light elements [1–40 ] have been paid more and more attention because of their excellent physical properties, such as semimetallic [7–12 ], metallic [15–20 ], or superhard mechanical properties [25–30 ], etc. For example, oC24 [8 ] is a stable three-dimensional carbon allotrope which has 24 carbon atoms orthorhombic conventional cell in Cmmm  symmetry. The calculation of electronic band structure of oC24 shows that it is a topological junction semimetal with two mirror image reversed symmetric junction lines. Another example, m -C3 N [15 ] is a potential superhard material with the hardness of 66.2 ​GPa, moreover, it exhibits the metallic properties due to the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum are both beyond the Fermi surface. These findings have established new light elements compounds phases with structural and electronic properties, which is of great significance and practical value. The developed particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to predict the crystal structures, and the possible crystal structure of B–C system is explored by Wang et al. [31 ]. In this work, they found six novel B–C system compounds, P 42 /mmc  B4 C, I 4mm  B3 C, R 3 B2 C, P 42 /mnm  BC, R -3c  B4 C, and P -3m 1 B5 C, some of which have higher shear modulus (exceed 240 ​GPa) except B4 C and BC4 , and some of which have higher hardnesses (more than 40 ​GPa) except B4 C, BC, and BC4 , it indicats that they are all superhard materials. Then, the structural, mechanical anisotropy, electronic properties, and thermodynamic properties of I 4mm  B3 C, R 3 B2 C, P 42 /mnm  BC are investigated systematically by Fan et al. [32–34 ]. Through the verification of the mechanical stability conditions, it can be found that the three structures are mechanically stable. Through the ratio of the maximum values and the minimum values of shear modulus and Young's modulus, it can be seen that I 4mm  B3 C has the largest mechanical anisotropy in shear modulus and Young's modulus, R 3 B2 C has the smallest mechanical anisotropy, the mechanical anisotropy in shear modulus and Young's modulus of I 4mm  B3 C is nearly three times that of R 3 B2 C. Yıldız et al. [35 ] conducts a comprehensive survey of the a -B4 C through crystal structure, electronic properties and mechanical properties using the quantum mechanical MD simulation. They found that C –C bond found in the amorphous state is not very favorable to the network, and the mean coordination numbers of B and C atoms for a -B4 C are correspondingly 5.29 and 4.17. Nevertheless, a  -B4 C can be classified as a material with high hardness. Using density functional theory, a carbon-rich boron carbide compound is proposed in this work. The crystal structure of B2 C3  which comes from Penta-C20  [39 ] is optimized by replacing the lower energy carbon atoms with boron atoms. The mechanical properties, mechanical anisotropy properties, stability, and electronic properties of B2 C3  are investigated systematically in this work. B2 C3  is a negative Poisson's ratio material, although it only shows negative Poisson's ratio on (111) plane, (100) plane, (010) plane, and (001) plane, it may has more potential applications than other boron carbide compounds.  2 Theoretical method The Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) [41 ] is used for structural optimization and performance prediction of B2 C3  based on density functional theory (DFT) [42 ,43 ]. The structural optimization of B2 C3  is carried out using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method [44 ]. The ultrasoft pseudopotentials [45 ] is used to describe the interaction between the ion nucleus and valence electron. The exchange correlation potential is processed by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [46 ], and the Ceperley and Alder data are parameterized by the Perdew and Zunger (CA-PZ) local density approximation (LDA) [47 ,48 ]. The electronic band structure of B2 C3  is calculated by the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) [49 ] hybrid functional. In addition, a cutoff energy of 500 ​eV and a high precision k -point grid of 2π ​× ​0.025 ​Å−1  are used to the Brillouin region for B2 C3 . The phonon spectrum of B2 C3  is adopted using the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [50 ].  3 Results and discussion Firstly, the three-dimensional structure of novel carbon rich B–C compounds is investigated. The crystal structures of B2 C3  are given in Fig. 1  , Fig. 1  (a) shows the overall structure of B2 C3 , it can be seen clearly that the alternating arrangement of boron and carbon atoms which have four layers totally with the same kind of atoms stacked. Fig. 1  (b) and (c) shows the front view of B2 C3  along b -axis and a -axis respectively. The lattice constants of B2 C3  with GGA-PBE, GGA-PBEsol and LDA functionals are shown in Table 1  , for diamond, the theoretical values based on the GGA-PBE is closer than that of experimental values than LDA and GGA-PBEsol functionals, so all the results presented in this work are based on GGA-PBE functional. From Fig. 1  (b) and (c), it is clear that the elementary rings composed of boron and carbon atoms are eighteen membered ring, four membered ring and six membered ring, respectively. Among the three kinds of rings above, only the four membered ring is composed of carbon atoms and boron atoms alternately, while the six membered ring and eighteen membered ring are mostly composed of carbon atoms, with 83.33% and 77.78%, respectively. In addition, there are two different equivalent positions for carbon atoms, 8g  (0.68003, 0.14197, 0.25000) and 4c  (0.00000, 0.45179, 0.75000), which are plotted in Fig. 1  (b) with red box. And there is only one equivalent position for boron atoms, 8g  (0.26328, 0.31831, 0.25000). The elastic constants of B2 C3  with PBE functional are shown in Table 2  , together with other elastic constants of B–C compounds with different stoichiometric ratios. Because the space group of B2 C3  is Cmcm , it belongs to orthorhombic system. The simplified as the following necessary and sufficient Born criteria for orthogonal systems is: C 11  ​> ​0, C 11 C 22  > C 12 2   , C 11 C 22 C 33  + 2C 12 C 13 C 23  – C 11 C 23 2   – C22 C 13 2   – C33 C 12 2    ​> ​0, C 44  ​> ​0, C 55  ​> ​0, C 66  ​> ​0, and all the elastic constants in Table 2  satisfy these conditions above. As another test of stability, the phonon spectrum and the partial phonon density of states of B2 C3  are also investigated and plotted in Fig. 2  , it can be seen that the phonon spectrum and the partial phonon density of states does not appear below zero, which proves that the novel carbon-rich B–C compounds B2 C3  structure proposed in this work is dynamically stable. The coordinates of Dirac high symmetry point are G (0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000), Z (0.0000, 0.0000, 0.5000), T (0.5000, 0.5000, 0.5000), Y (0.5000, 0.5000, 0.0000), G (0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000), S (0.0000, 0.5000, 0.0000), R (0.0000, 0.5000, 0.5000), Z (0.0000, 0.0000, 0.5000) in order. The accurately calculated formation enthalpies of B–C compounds are summarized in Fig. 3  , meanwhile the most energetically advantageous structures on a per atom basis are standardized. The sum of enthalpies of diamond and α −B12  is taken as zero. The formation enthalpy of ΔH  of B2 C3  is defined as ΔH  ​= ​[E B2C3 -(E α −B12 /6 ​+ ​3E diamond /8)]. On B:C ​= ​1:1, B4 C4  and BC stoichiometric ratios have significant negative enthalpies for decomposition into α −B12  and diamond. The enthalpy of the most energy-stable structure is BC. However, the enthalpy is all in the connection between α −B12 + diamond and c -BC. The carbon-rich zone, B2 C3  is more thermodynamically stable than that of BC7 . The three-dimensional distribution and magnitude of Young's modulus for B2 C3  in some main planes are shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b)  , respectively. The former is shaped like an ellipse with a bulge near the short axis, which is similar to the squaroglitter-like carbon structures [1 ]. The maximum values and the minimum values of Young's modulus for B2 C3  are listed in Table 3  , together with other B–C compounds. From Table 3 , the disparity between the maximum values and the minimum values is quite obvious, the ratio of them is about 7 and 6 times that of B4 C4  [36 ] and BC [34 ], respectively, because the minimum values are much lower than others. Compared with squaroglitter-like carbon structures [1 ], although the Young's modulus anisotropy of t P24 is the smallest in these squaroglitter-like carbon structures, it is still higher than that of B2 C [33 ], B4 C4  [36 ], and BC [34 ]. In addition, although the Young's modulus anisotropy of squaroglitter carbon structures t P8 is the greatest among these squaroglitter-like carbon structures, it is still lower than that of B2 C3 . The 2D representation of Young's modulus for B2 C3  in (111), (110), (100), (101), (011), (010), and (001) planes are shown in Fig. 4  (b). Obviously, seven major planes are mechanical anisotropy in Young's modulus. The maximum values and the minimum values of Young's modulus in (111), (100), (010), and (001) planes for B2 C3 , and the E max /E min  ratio of five B–C compounds are shown in Table 4  . Considering the size of the table, four main planes are listed in Table 4 . The mechanical anisotropy of Young's modulus of B2 C3  in (010) plane is the greatest, because of the maximum values and the minimum values of Young's modulus both appear in (010) plane. The smallest mechanical anisotropy of Young's modulus for B2 C3  is (111) plane, among all the five boron carbide compounds studied, the anisotropy of Young's modulus in (001) plane of B2 C is the smallest because it is isotropic. The three-dimensional distribution of the maximum values and the minimum values of shear modulus and Poisson's ratio for five boron carbide compounds studied are shown in Fig. 5   and Fig. 6  , respectively. It is obvious that these five boron carbide compounds exhibit anisotropy from the shape of three-dimensional distribution with the maximum and minimum shear modulus, but it is difficult to see the magnitude of their shear modulus anisotropy. And the maximum and the minimum shear modulus ratio is necessary to illustrate the shear modulus of the material the magnitude of anisotropy, so the maximum values, the minimum values of shear modulus, and the G max /G min  ratio for these five boron carbide compounds are also listed in Table 3 , and the maximum values, the minimum values of shear modulus in (111), (100), (010), and (001) planes for these five boron carbide compounds are shown in Table 4 . Similar to Young's modulus, the G max /G min  ratio of B2 C3  is the largest, which is about 5 and 4 times that of B4 C4  [36 ] and BC [34 ], respectively. Different with Young's modulus, the mechanical anisotropy of shear modulus in (111) plane for B2 C3  is the largest, while (100) plane is the smallest for B2 C3 , the G max /G min  ratio of (100) plane for B2 C3  is only 1.284, it is also the smallest for these five boron carbide compounds. For Poisson's ratio, the five boron carbide compounds exhibit anisotropy from the shape of the three-dimensional distribution with the maximum and minimum Poisson's ratio. The maximum values and the minimum values of shear modulus in (111), (100), (010), and (001) planes for these five boron carbide compounds are also listed in Table 5  . It can be found that although the Poisson's ratio of these five materials is not negative, while some of their minimum values in some planes are negative. The minimum values of Poisson's ratio for B2 C3  is negative in four main planes studied. For B4 C4 , B3 C, and BC, the minimum values of Poisson's ratio in four planes is only below 0.01 or 0.02 than zero, while for B2 C3 , the minimum Poisson's ratio reaches −0.5. The negative Poisson's ratio of B2 C3  in (001), (010), (011), (100), (101), (110), and (111) planes are shown in Fig. 6  (c). From Fig. 6  (c), it is found that all negative Poisson's ratios also show anisotropy in these main plane. The minimum negative Poisson's ratio of B2 C3  in all directions is - 0.50, which only appears in (010) plane. The minimum negative Poisson's ratio of (111) plane is −0.44, the minimum negative Poisson's ratio in (101) plane is −0.36, while the negative Poisson's ratio in (001) and (100) planes are slightly greater than that of other planes. Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) effect refers to the transverse expansion of a material within the elastic range when it is stretched. In recent years, NPR effect has been found in some materials with special structures [51–56 ], which attracts much attention of material scientists and physicists because of their peculiar properties different from ordinary materials, especially the physical and mechanical properties. NPR materials are of great significance not only in the manufacture of daily necessities such as bottle stopper and cushion, but also in some important fields such as aviation, national defense and electronic industry. Therefore, B2 C3  is expected to be used in more potential areas than other boron carbide compounds. Finally, the electronic properties of NPR material B2 C3  is investigated. The electronic band structure of B2 C3  is shown in Fig. 7  , it can be seen directly from the band structure that there is no conduction band minimum (CBM) or valence band maximum (VBM) at the Dirac high symmetry point. After confirmed the position, CBM and VBM are marked with an orange dot and a cyan dot, respectively. It is found that B2 C3  has a direct band gap which is 1.494 ​eV. The CBM and VBM of B2 C3  are located at (0.0000, 0.0000, 0.4474) point and (0.0000, 0.0000, 0.3421) point, respectively, the CBM and VBM both located at between G to Z.  4 Conclusions In summary, the carbon-rich B–C compounds in orthorhombic phase, B2 C3 , is proposed in this work. The thermodynamic stability, dynamic stability, and mechanical stability of B2 C3  are confirmed by the formation enthalpies, phonon spectra and elastic constants. The crystal structure of B2 C3  consists of elementary rings with boron and carbon atoms, the elementary rings are eighteen membered rings, four membered rings and six membered rings, respectively. It is because of the existence of eighteen membered ring that its mechanical properties are slightly poorer. From the electronic band structure, one can find that B2 C3  is a semiconductor material with indirect band gap. In addition, the mechanical anisotropy in Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and shear modulus of B2 C3  are always larger than that of other B–C compounds, but slightly smaller on some planes. B2 C3  is a material with negative Poisson's ratio, although it only shows negative Poisson's ratio in some plane, but it is expected to be used in more potential areas than other boron carbide compounds.

                     3c, a=25.977(3) Å, V=17,529(4) Å3 with Z=32. The structures are composed of discrete (CH3)4P+ or (CH3)4Sb+ cations and tetrahedral CoCl4
                     2−, CuCl4
                     2− or ZnBr4
                     2− anions. All three are commensurately modulated and the superspace group is subsequently assigned to (TMSb)2CuCl4 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4. The structures are correlated by an ascent of symmetry diagram with a fictional, pseudo-antifluorite Fm

The atoms comprising the CoCl4 2−  anions are represented by open circles, the atoms comprising the (CH3 )4 P+  cations are represented by dots, and the hydrogen atoms are deleted for clarity. The arrow pointing toward one of the anions is explained in the text and in the caption to Fig. 4 .    Fig. 2 Stereoscopic view of one octant of the unit cell of [(CH3 )4 Sb]2 ZnBr4 . The atoms comprising the ZnBr4 2−  anions are represented by open circles, the atoms comprising the (CH3 )4 P+  cations are represented by dots, and the hydrogen atoms are deleted for clarity.    Fig. 3 Schematic of the (binary) antifluorite unit cell. Small solid circles are dinegative anions. Large open circles are monopositive cations.    Fig. 4 Stereoscopic view of a subsection of [(CH3 )4 P]2 CoCl4  corresponding to a unit cell of the pseudo-antifluorite structure. The atoms comprising the CoCl4 2−  anions are represented by open circles, the atoms comprising the (CH3 )4 P+  cations are represented by dots, and the hydrogen atoms are deleted for clarity. The arrow pointing toward one of the anions and its oriented counterpart pointing toward a symmetry equivalent anion in Fig. 1  are included to enable the orientation of the subsection shown here to be visualized with respect to the unit cell shown in Fig. 1 .    Fig. 5 Ascent (or descent) of symmetry diagram connecting observed structures of the (TMAs)2 CoCl4  family with the fictitious Fm 3 ̄   m  pseudo−antifluorite aristotype. The intermediate, ≈337 to ≈547 K phase of (TMAs)2 CoCl4  and (TMAs)2 ZnCl4  is designated by ‘int.’    Fig. 6 Detailed ascent of symmetry diagrams corresponding to subsections of Fig. 5 . The symmetry elements to the left of the arrows are added to the lower symmetry groups H  in order to generate the higher symmetry groups G [10] . The notation comes from the International Tables , Volume A. The tn  or kn  designation denotes respectively a translationengleiche or klassengleiche relationship, with n  giving the index of H  in G . The corresponding notation used in the International Tables  follows in parentheses. Any change of basis vectors is given to the right of the arrow; primed vectors form the basis of G  and unprimed vectors form the basis of H . If the space group is unconventional, the equivalent conventional space group, corresponding to a smaller unit cell, is included in parentheses.

Structures of [(CH3 )4 P]2 CoCl4 , [(CH3 )4 Sb]2 CuCl4  and [(CH3 )4 Sb]2 ZnBr4  and a correlation of pseudo-antifluorite [(CH3 )4 Pn ]2 MX 4  salts Mark R Pressprich  Marcus R Bond  Roger D Willett *  Department of Chemistry, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, 99164, USA  * Corresponding author. Tel.: +1-509-335-3925; fax: +1-509-335-8867     The room temperature structure of three members of the A 2 MX 4  cubic antifluorite family are reported. [(CH3 )4 P]2 CoCl4  is orthorhombic, Pnma , a =18.385(2), b =25.134(3), c =12.758(3) Å, V =5895(2) Å3  with Z =12. [(CH3 )4 Sb]2 CuCl4  is cubic, F 4 ̄   3c , a =25.020(3) Å with V =15,663(3) Å3 . [(CH3 )4 Sb]2 ZnBr4  is also cubic, F 4 ̄   3c , a =25.977(3) Å, V =17,529(4) Å3  with Z =32. The structures are composed of discrete (CH3 )4 P+  or (CH3 )4 Sb+  cations and tetrahedral CoCl4 2− , CuCl4 2−  or ZnBr4 2−  anions. All three are commensurately modulated and the superspace group is subsequently assigned to (TMSb)2 CuCl4  and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4 . The structures are correlated by an ascent of symmetry diagram with a fictional, pseudo-antifluorite Fm 3 ̄   m  aristotype having ≈12.7 Å axes. The previously reported room temperature structures of [(CH3 )4 As]2 ZnCl4  and [(CH3 )4 As]2 CoCl4 , as well as the structures of their estimated, higher temperature phases, are similarly correlated.    1 Introduction The [(CH3 )4 N]2 MX 4  family of compounds is well known for interesting phase transitions and modulated phases, both commensurate and incommensurate. By replacing the central nitrogen atom of the cation with the higher pn icogens, Pn =P, As and Sb, our laboratory has recently extended this family to include another 20 [(CH3 )4 Pn ]2 MX 4  (hereafter (TMPn )2 MX 4 ) salts [1] . Two of these, (TMP)2 CuC14 , and (TMP)2 CuBr4 , have been shown to have incommensurate phases. The chloride salt is characterized by a widely varying modulation vector [2,3] , while the range of incommensuration is much smaller for the bromide salt [4] . In the survey of all twenty compounds it was shown that the (TMPn )2 MX 4  salts fall into two structural classes: the well known (distorted) β-K2 SO4  class, containing all the N analogs, and another, the (TMAs)2 CoCl4  class. Besides this prototype, the structure of one other member of this new class, (TMAs)2 ZnCl4 , has been reported [5] . The tentative inclusion of (TMP)2 CoCl4 , (TMP)2 ZnC14 , (TMAs)2 CuCl4 , (TMSb)2 CoCl4 , (TMSb)2 CuCl4 , (TMSb)2 ZnCl4 , (TMSb)2 CoBr4 , (TMsb)2 CuBr4 , and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  into this new class was based on an apparent association with a cubic unit cell having ≈12.7 Å axes. These latter nine compounds have axial lengths of ≈12.7, ≈2   ×12.7 or ≈2×12.7 Å. These structures are closely related to the (Et4 N)2 MX 4  series [6,7,16] . The Bravais lattices and phase transitions were also reported for these compounds. At room temperature, the phosphorus containing salts have primitive orthorhombic unit cells, (TMAs)2 CuCl4  has a body centered tetragonal cell, (TMAs)2 CoCl4  and (TMAs)2 ZnCl4  have primitive tetragonal cells (P 42 /mbc ), and the antimony containing salts have face centered cubic unit cells. DSC results showed at least one thermal anomaly for each compound. The anomalies probably correspond either to phase transitions, resulting in a change of space group symmetry, or to decomposition, particularly for anomalies observed at higher temperatures. TMP salts.  (TMP)2 CoCl4  and (TMP)2 ZnCl4  each showed two similar anomalies between 103 and 523 K, one with T tr ≈320 K and ΔS tr ≈1.4 R; the other with T tr ≈462 K and ΔS tr ≈2.0 R. TMAs salts.  (TMAs)2 CuCl4  showed two anomalies between 113 and 573 K, one with T tr =260 K and ΔS tr =0.7 R; the other with T tr =488 K and ΔS tr =0.4 R. (TMAs)2 CoCl4  and (TMAs)2 ZnCl4  showed two anomalies between 103 and 573 K, one with T tr ≈337 K and ΔS tr ≈0.9 R; the other with T tr ≈547 K and ΔS tr ≈0.3 R. TMSb salts . The TMSb salts, with the exception of (TMSb)2 CuCl4  and (TMSb)2 CuBr4 , each showed one anomaly between 113 and 523 K, with 446 K<T tr <475 K and 0.9 R<ΔS tr <l.5 R. (TMSb)2 CuCl4  showed four anomalies between 113 and 493 K (decomposition), with T tr =140 K and ΔS tr =1.0 R; T tr =160 K and ΔS tr =0.3 R; T tr =408 K and ΔS tr =0.9 R; and T tr =490 K and ΔS tr =0.7 R. (TMSb)2 CuBr4  showed three anomalies between 103 and 488 K (decomposition), with T tr =178 K and ΔS tr =0.9 R; T tr =359 K and ΔS tr =1.0 R; and T tr =478 K and ΔS tr =0.3 R. This paper reports the further correlation of the members of this new (TMAs)2 CoCl4  family through the room temperature single crystal X-ray structure analyses of (TMP)2 CoCl4 , (TMSb)2 CuCl4 , and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4 , and through a reconsideration of the reported structures of (TMAs)2 CoCl4  and (TMAs)2 ZnCl4 .  2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis The syntheses of (TMP)2 CoCl4 , (TMSb)2 CuCl4 , and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  have been reported previously [2] . X-ray data collection and reduction The data collection and reduction techniques that were common to all three compounds are as follows. X-ray data were collected on a Syntex P21  diffractometer upgraded to Siemens/Nicolet P3F or P4 specifications using graphite monochromated MoKα  (λ =0.71069 Å) radiation. The data were profile fit and Lorentz and polarization corrections were made. The structures, except (TMSb)2 ZnBr4 , were solved by direct methods [8] , with final refinements made with SHELXTL or SHELXTL PLUS [9]  software (TMSb+  salts only). The function minimized was ∑w (|F o |−|F c |)2  with w  clarified in Table 1  . The atomic scattering factors of SHELXTL or SHELXTL PLUS were used. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were constrained to C–H distances of 0.96 Å and their isotropic thermal parameters were set at ≈1.2 times the equivalent isotropic thermal parameters of associated carbon atoms. Other lattice and data collection parameters are listed in Table 1 .  (TMP)2 CoCl4  No significant changes in check reflection intensities, monitored every 96 reflections, were observed during data collection. The systematic extinctions indicated either centrosymmetric Pnma  or noncentrosymmetric Pn 21 a  space groups. The structure refined smoothly, but slowly, in Pnma  and the noncentrosymmetric option was not tested, as the refined model was not excessively disordered perpendicular to the mirror plane.  (TMSb)2 CuCl4  No significant changes in check reflection intensities, monitored every 100 reflections, were observed during data collection. Systematic extinctions indicated F 4 ̄   3c  or Fm 3c  as possible space groups. The centrosymmetric choice seemed unlikely, however, because the tetrahedral anions would be required to lie on sites with inversion symmetry. The structure refined smoothly in F 4 ̄   3c  to wR =0.046, subject to loose constraints of the Sb–C bond distances to approximately 2.1 Å (using the DFlX command in SHELXTL PLUS).  (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  The structure was solved in the space group F 4 ̄   3c  by starting with the refined coordinates of the (TMSb)2 CuCl4  structure. The structure refined smoothly to wR =0.058. However, the thermal parameters for one of the carbon atoms, C(4), refined to unreasonable values. An analysis of ‖F o |−|F c ‖/σ (F o ) data showed two reflections, (0, 0, 6) and (0, 2, 6), with ‖F o |−|F c ‖/σ (F o ) values greater than almost twice that of any other reflections. These reflections were removed, the refinement converged with wR =0.054, with reasonable behavior of the thermal parameters for C(4).    3 Results and discussion The final atomic parameters for (TMP)2 CoCl4 , (TMSb)2 CuCl4 , and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  at room temperature are listed in Table 2  and bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 3  . The unit cell of (TMP)2 CoCl4  is shown in Fig. 1  and a stereoview of an octant of the unit cell of (TMSb)2 ZnBr4 , with 0<x , y , z <1/2, is shown in Fig. 2  . The room temperature structures of (TMP)2 CoCl4 , (TMSb)2 CuCl4  and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  are composed of discrete monopositive cations and dinegative anions [10] . The ions are significantly disordered, as shown by the large carbon thermal ellipsoids for the atoms in the cations and the even larger halide atom ellipsoids of most of the atoms in the anions. The significantly smaller ellipsoids of the central atoms of the ions imply that the disorder, if dynamic, is primarily librational, involving rotations about the centers of mass. Whether static or dynamic, the disorder leaves the geometries of the individual ions somewhat uncertain. The high symmetry sites occupied by the anions in the cubic structures of (TMSb)2 CuC14  and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  further complicate the analysis of their geometries. In (TMSb)2 CuCl4  and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  at room temperature, the MX 4 2−  anions occupy two crystallographically inequivalent sites, having 23.(T) and 4 ̄   ..(S4 ) symmetry. In both salts the anions occupying the 23. sites show similarly large thermal ellipsoids for their halide atoms (U eq ≈0.20 Å), indicating significant disorder. The similar ellipsoids for both salts implies that the disorder for the copper salt is not primarily due to the averaging of expected tetragonally compressed CuC14 2−  tetrahedra caused by the Jahn–Teller effect. The anions occupying the S4  sites are significantly less disordered and are nearly tetrahedral, with maximum bond angles of 116.1(3) and 113.2(2)° for the copper and zinc salts, respectively. The 116.1° angle is significantly smaller than the expected 128–140° range typically found in discrete Jahn–Teller distorted CuCl4 2−  anions in similar structures [11,12] . The expected Jahn–Teller distortion of the CuCl4 2−  anions also explains the different phase transition sequences experienced by the (TMSb)2 CuX 4  (X =Cl, Br) salts versus the (TMSb)2 MX 4  (M =Co, Zn; X =Cl, Br) salts. As reviewed in the Introduction , (TMSb)2 CuCl4  apparently undergoes two phase transitions below room temperature, (TMSb)2 CuBr4  apparently undergoes one, and the rest of the (TMSb)2 MX 4  salts undergo no sub-room temperature phase transitions. All of these Sb salts have F  centered cubic lattices and are probably isomorphic. Then if, as expected, the CuX 4 2−  anions are Jahn–Teller distorted, the onset of ordering in the Cu salts at lower temperatures requires the simultaneous lowering of the anion site symmetries to D2d  or one of its subgroups, which in turn drives the phase transitions to lower symmetry space groups. The Co and Zn salts require no such lowering of their anion site symmetries with the onset of ordering at lower temperatures. A similar situation has been observed in the M 2 I M II [Cu(NO2 )6 ] and M 2 I M II [Ni(NO2 )6 ] series of compounds [13] . The M 2 I M II [Cu(NO2 )6 ] compounds undergo cubic to orthorhombic phase transitions that are unobserved in the nickel analogs. In (TMP)2 CoCl4  at room temperature, the CoCl4 2−  anions occupy two crystallographically inequivalent sites, having .m . (Cs ) and 1 (C1 ) symmetry. The anions are generally more ordered than in the Sb salts, as shown by the halide atom thermal parameters (0.09<U eq <0.16 Å). The anions vary little from tetrahedral geometries, with a maximum bond angle of l12.8°. The geometries of the (CH3 )4 Pn +  cations of all three structures appear to be close to tetrahedral. However, the large thermal ellipsoids and uncertainties in the positions of the carbon atoms lead to poor definition of the cation geometries. The (CH3 )4 P+  cations of the (TMP)2 CoCl4  structure show the most distortion, with angles varying from 103.8(9) to 114.9(5)°. The (CH3 )4 Sb+  cations of the of (TMSb)2 CuC14  and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  structures have angles varying from 108.3(7) to 110.5(9)° for the former and from 106.4(8) to 112.4(7)° for the latter. The room temperature unit cells of (TMP)2 CoCl4 , (TMSb)2 CuC14  and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  may be considered to be the result of commensurate modulations of smaller parent unit cells. For (TMP)2 CoCl4 , reflections with h ≠2n  and k ≠3m  (n , m  integers) are weak. Therefore, the structure may be considered as having a parent cell, with basis vectors of a  ′=a  /2, b  ′=b  /3, and c  ′=c  , which is commensurately modulated in two dimensions with the modulation vectors k1 =a  *′/2 and k2 =b *′/3(a *′=2a *, b  *′=3b  *, c  *′=c  *). For (TMSb)2 CuCl4  and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4 , reflections with h +k +l ≠2n  are weak, which indicates parent structures with basis vectors of a  ′=a  /2, b  ′=b  /2, and c  ′=c  /2, and the one-dimensional commensurate modulation vector k =(a *′+b *′+c *′) /2(a  *′=2a  *, b  *′=2b  *, c  *′=2c  *). The modulation is one-dimensional in the sense that the primary reflections, corresponding to the parent structure, can be indexed by integers h ′, k ′, and l ′ with respect to a  *′, b  *′, and c  *′, but indexing the satellite reflections, caused by the modulation, requires an additional integer, m, related to k  . Using the superspace notation developed for one-dimensional modulated structures, [14,15]  the 3+1 superspace Bravais Class of the room temperature structures of (TMSb)2 CuC14  and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  is T Pm 3̄m  1̄1̄s  (1 2   ,1 2   ,1 2   ) and their common superspace group is T Pm 3̄m  1̄1̄s  . 3.1 Ascent of symmetry analyses The arrangement of ions in all three salts is conveniently understood in terms of an imaginary common aristotype structure having a pseudo-antifluorite arrangement of ions. For reference and review, a schematic view of the binary antifluorite structure type is included as Fig. 3  . The antifluorite structure has a cubic, Fm 3 ̄   m  unit cell with anions at Wyckoff position a  at (0, 0, 0)+ and cations at Wyckoff position c  at (1/4, 1/4, 1/4)+ and (1/4, 1/4, 3/4)+, where the plus signs include the coordinates due to the F  centering [10] . Each of the four anions per unit cell is coordinated by eight cations in a cubic arrangement. The site symmetry of each is m 3m  (Oh ). The eight cations per unit cell are each tetrahedrally coordinated by four anions, in agreement with the 4 ̄  3m  site symmetry. The pseudoantifluorite aristotype has tetrahedral ions, with Td  symmetry, centered at these same sites. The ‘pseudo-’ modifier refers to the non-binary nature of the aristotype structure. Necessarily, the anions of the aristotype are each two-fold disordered, corresponding to the addition of the center of inversion needed to generate Oh  from Td . The axial lengths are ≈12.7 Å. The structures of (TMP)2 CoCl4 , (TMSb)2 CuC14  and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  are lower symmetry analogs of the aristotype. The latter two Sb salts have nearly isostructural arrangements of ions, so the following discussion or pictures of (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  also apply to (TMSb)2 CuCl4 . The similarity of the three salts to each other and to the fictional aristotype becomes apparent after comparing Figs. 2–4  . Figs. 2 and 4  show sub-unit cells of (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  and (TMP)2 CoCl4  corresponding to a single unit cell of the Fm 3 ̄   m  aristotype. The octant (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  shown in Fig. 2  coincides with the modulated parent cell discussed above, so an adjacent (unpictured) octant is similar. Thus, the octant may be considered a quasi-unit cell. The anions at the face-centers of the quasi-unit cell are primarily responsible for breaking the quasi-periodicity along x , y , and z . An examination of Fig. 2  shows that the anions at the opposite sides of the quasi-unit cell are non-superimposable near-mirror images. The subsection of (TMP)2 CoCl4  shown in Fig. 4  is a simple multiple (doubling) of the modulated parent cell discussed above, so it also represents a quasi-unit cell. The transformation from the modulated parent cell to this subsection is a  ′=a  −b  , b  ′=a  +b  , and c ′=c  . Or, the transformation from the actual unit cell to this subsection is a  ′=a  /2−b  /3, b  ′=a  /2+b  /3, and c ′=c  . In Figs. 1 and 4  an oriented arrow points toward symmetry equivalent anions, allowing the orientation of the sub-unit cell of Fig. 4  to be visualized with respect to the unit cell of Fig. 1 . The relationships between the fictional Fm 3̄m  aristotype and the reported structures of the (TMAs)2 CoCl4  family are explicitly shown by the ascent of symmetry diagram in Fig. 5  . The space groups of the seven observed structures form the base of the diagram. The other space groups, of intermediate symmetry between those of the observed structures and the fictional aristotype, form paths of minimal supergroups. For each of these intermediate space groups, as well as for the aristotype group, hypothetical structures can be discussed in terms of the required site symmetries of their constituent ions (derived below). In this respect it is convenient to separate the space groups into two classes: those (observed or hypothetical) in which the ions occupy sites with symmetry of Td  parentage (starred in Fig. 5 ) or, conversely, those in which the occupied sites have point group symmetry not subgroup related to Td . In fact, space groups for the latter case (no star) all require centers of inversion at some or all of the hypothetical anion sites. Thus, the space groups indicated by asterisks are the most plausible candidates for the higher temperature phases of the observed structures. In regard to these alternate paths of ascent it may be noted that there are no plausible supergroups of C 42 /mcd  (P 42 /mbc ), the space group of the room temperature phase structures of (TMAs)2 ZnCl4  and (TMAs)2 CoCl4 . Instead, the tentative space group assigned to both of these salts above the transition at ≈337 K is I 41 /a , a site-compatible space group, but one not related to P 42 /mbc  in any direct supergroup or subgroup manner. Thus, the associated first order phase transition observed for these two salts can be understood based on the assumption that the ions will remain in sites of symmetry with Td  parentage. Fig. 6(a)–(d)  further detail the various paths of symmetry shown in Fig. 5 . Each gives the paths of symmetry starting with the space group of observed or suspected structures, passing through all site-compatible higher symmetry space groups and finishing with the Fm 3m  space group of the fictional pseudo-antifluorite aristotype structure. The ascent of symmetry diagrammatic method has been chosen over the more conventional descent of symmetry method to allow the explicit notation of all the additional generators needed to produce the minimal supergroups G  from H . By ascending in symmetry, the added generators are expressed in the basis of H , often the basis of a larger unit cell than that of G . An example shows the advantage: addition of T (1/2, 0, 0) to F4 ̄  3c  obviously leads to the additional lattice points necessary to produce the eight primitive P4 ̄  3m  unit cells from each F4 ̄  3c  unit cell. Conversely, the descent of symmetry from P 4 ̄   3m  to F 4 ̄   3c  would be difficult to express symbolically in the basis of the smaller P 4 ̄   3m  unit cell. With respect to the analysis of (TMP)2 CoC14 , (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  and (TMSb)2 CuCl4  as modulated structures, as discussed above, the space groups of the unmodulated parent structures can be obtained directly from Fig. 6(d) and 6(a) . The unmodulated parent space group of (TMP)2 CoCl4  is Pnmm  with axes of a ′≈9.193 Å, b ′≈8.378 Å, and c ′≈12.758 Å. The unmodulated parent space group of (TMSb)2 CuC14  and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  is P 4 ̄   3m  with a ′≈12.511 Å and a ′≈12.984 Å, respectively. As mentioned above, the site symmetries of the constituent ions of the hypothetical pseudo-antifluorite structure can be determined. The determined site symmetries of the ions are listed in Table 4  along with their Wyckoff positions as listed in the International Tables for Crystallography , Vol. A. [10] . The listed ion positions are uniquely determined, within a trivial change of origin, by the observed positions of the ions of the known structures in conjunction with the assumption that the structures will tend toward the pseudo-antifluorite structure with increasing symmetry. In particular, the special sets of anion positions of the I 4l /a  structures of (TMAs)2 CoCl4  and (TMAs)2 ZnCl4 , believed to occur above T ≈337 K, are predicted uniquely.   4 Summary The room temperature structures of (TMP)2 CoCl4 , (TMSb)2 CuCl4 , and (TMSb)2 ZnBr4  have been determined. All three salts can be considered as commensurately modulated structures, and, for the latter two, a 3+1 dimensional superspace group has been assigned. These structures, as well as the room temperature and hypothesized higher temperature structures of (TMAs)2 CoCl4  and (TMAs)2 ZnCl4 , have been correlated by an ascent of symmetry diagram with a fictitious Fm 3 ̄   m  aristotype. Based on lattice parameters obtained at room temperature, the other (TMPn )2 MX 4  compounds of the (TMAs)2 CoCl4  family can also be assumed to have distorted pseudo-antifluorite structures.  5 Supplementary material Lists of observed and calculated structure factors, anisotropic thermal parameters, and hydrogen atom coordinates for the three structures are available from the authors.

                  Garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 is currently being extensively studied as a potential candidate to replace the conventional liquid electrolytes due to prominent ionic conductivity and structural stability. The microstructure is the one of the important factor to obtain the electrochemical performances, resulting from Li-ion kinetics, local current density. Herein, we synthesize the Li6.1Ga0.3La3Zr2O12 with various Li2O–B2O3–SiO2 concentration (1, 3, 5, and 10 wt%) as a glass additive and investigate the effect on the crystallization, relative density, lithium ion conductivity and critical current density. Our findings reveal that proper amount of Li2O–B2O3–SiO2 could enhance the sinterability, thus enabling facile and continuous lithium ion conduction with suppressing propagation of Li dendrite through the pores. Therefore, it can be concluded that appropriate concentration of Li2O–B2O3–SiO2 can be regarded as a breakthrough to construct better solid electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium ion batteries.

Handling Editor: Dr P. Vincenzini Garnet-type Li7 La3 Zr2 O12  is currently being extensively studied as a potential candidate to replace the conventional liquid electrolytes due to prominent ionic conductivity and structural stability. The microstructure is the one of the important factor to obtain the electrochemical performances, resulting from Li-ion kinetics, local current density. Herein, we synthesize the Li6.1 Ga0.3 La3 Zr2 O12  with various Li2 O–B2 O3 –SiO2  concentration (1, 3, 5, and 10 wt%) as a glass additive and investigate the effect on the crystallization, relative density, lithium ion conductivity and critical current density. Our findings reveal that proper amount of Li2 O–B2 O3 –SiO2  could enhance the sinterability, thus enabling facile and continuous lithium ion conduction with suppressing propagation of Li dendrite through the pores. Therefore, it can be concluded that appropriate concentration of Li2 O–B2 O3 –SiO2  can be regarded as a breakthrough to construct better solid electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium ion batteries.   Keywords Garnet-type Li7 La3 Zr2 O12   Li2 O–B2 O3 –SiO2   Glass additive  Li dendrite  Solid electrolyte    1 Introduction With the continuous growth of the electric vehicle (EV) market, concerns about the safety of conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are emerging [1–5 ]. Liquid electrolytes has risks such as fire and explosion [6 ], which prompt researchers to investigate solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) that offer enhanced safety and reliability [7 ]. However, SSEs still face a lot of challenges, including the need for high lithium-ion conductivity, negligible electronic conductivity, and superior structural stability to deliver ideal SSEs [8 ]. SSEs can be divided into three main categories based on materials: i) sulfide-based, ii) oxide-based, and iii) polymer-based electrolyte [9–11 ]. Among them, sulfide-based SSEs offer excellent lithium-ion conductivity, however, they exhibit inherent poor air stability, resulting in structure decay and toxic H2 S gas [12 ]. The polymer-based solid electrolytes have the advantage of low electrode/electrolyte interfacial resistance, but they are constrained to high-temperature environments [13 ]. On the other hand, oxide-based solid electrolytes exhibit relatively superior air stability and good lithium-ion conductivity. Therefore, extensive research has been conducted on oxide-based SSEs. Among various candidates, garnet-type Li6.1 Ga0.3 La3 Zr2 O12  (LLZO) is in the spotlight as exceptional ion conductivity, electrochemical stability and stability in contact with Li metal. Generally, it is well known that cubic LLZO with favorable ionic conductivity and lower activation energy that those of tetragonal LLZO. For obtaining the cubic phase, LLZO doped with Al3+ , Ga3+ , Ta5+  has been widely studied since they are cheap and good ionic conductivity [14–16 ]. Nevertheless, considering the co-sintering with the electrode, challenges remain in maximizing the relative density under low sintering temperature. Achieving a reduction in the sintering temperature while simultaneously increasing the relative density has proven to be challenging [13 ]. Many researchers reported that the addition of sintering aids (Li2 CO3  [17 ], Li3 PO4  [18 ], and CuO [19 ]) allows the optimized relative density at low sintering temperature. Li2 O–B2 O3 –SiO2  (LBS) is also used as a sintering additive. Li2 O–SiO2  binary glass has a disadvantage of significant tendency to crystallize. To solve this problem, B2 O3  addition converts Li2 O–SiO2  into a ternary glass and expands the glass formation area. It ultimately improves density and conductivity while reducing sintering time and temperature. Therefore, LBS serves as an excellent sintering additive. In this study, we synthesized Li6.1 Ga0.3 La3 Zr2 O12  (LGLZO) with different concentration (1 wt% (LGLZO-1LBS), 3 wt% (LGLZO-3LBS), 5 wt% (LGLZO-5LBS), and 10 wt% (LGLZO-10LBS)) of Li2 O–B2 O3 –SiO2  (LBS) as a sintering aid and compare the structure-electrochemical performances. Consequently, the appropriate amount of sinter aid is constructive way to fabricate high performance LGLZO for next-generation battery system.  2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of Ga-LLZO, LBS powders In the study, LGLZO powders with the composition Li6.1 Ga0.3 La3 Zr2 O12  were synthesized using a conventional solid-state method [13 ]. To compensate for lithium evaporation during the heat-treatment processes, the stoichiometric ratio of Li2 CO3 , Ga2 O3 , ZrO2 , and La2 O3  was adjusted with an excess of 10 wt% Li2 CO3 . In order to remove moisture and CO2 , the La2 O3  powders were subjected to heating at 900 °C for 12 h. The starting materials were then ball milled with isopropanol at a speed of 250 rpm for 10 h. To obtain highly pure cubic garnet powder, the resulting mixture was dried at 100 °C for 10 h and subsequently calcined at 850 °C for 6 h in Al2 O3  crucibles at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Finally, the powders underwent wet ball milling at 250 rpm for 10 h to achieve a fine powder consistency. To produce the glass, a mixture of lithium carbonate (Li2 CO3 ), boric acid (H3 BO3 ), and silica (SiO2 ) was prepared using the stoichiometric ratio of the starting materials. The mixture was then heated in a Al2 O3  crucible at a temperature of 1200 °C for a duration of 1.5 h. Afterward, the samples were obtained using the conventional quenching method and subsequently subjected to annealing at temperatures below the glass transition temperature [20 ]. After the synthesis process, the resulting LBS and LGLZO powder were ball milled at a rotational speed of 250 rpm for a duration of 10 min. Subsequently, the powdered samples were compressed into pellets under a pressure of 500 MPa. The pellets were then sintered in an air atmosphere at a temperature of 1150 °C for 6 h. The heating rate during the sintering process was set at 5 °C/min. Samples were prepared by varying the amount added (0, 1, 3, 5 and 10 wt%) in accordance with the sintering conditions of 1150 °C for 6 h.  2.2 Characterization and analysis methods The phase characterization of the synthesized samples was conducted at room temperature using X-ray diffraction (Bruker AXS GmbH, D8 Discover plus) within the 2θ range of 10°–70°. The scanning rate employed was 0.1°/sec. Raman spectra were acquired at room temperature using Raman analysis (Horiba Raman) over the wavelength range of 50–1000 cm−1 . The surface microstructure of the samples was examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL, JSM-7900F). The relative densities were assessed utilizing the Archimedes method, employing alcohol as the immersion medium and density measurements were performed with Mettler-Toledo density measurement attachments. To confirm the glass crystallization in the obtained samples, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was conducted. The DSC measurements were performed using an SDT Q600 instrument from TA Instruments, with a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere. The temperature range for the measurements was set from 15 °C to 600 °C. The thermal properties of the samples were determined using the simultaneous DSC system.  2.3 Electrochemical performance evaluation Before assembling the cells, the samples were polished to remove surface contamination. Room temperature electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted using AC impedance analysis (EC-lab, SP-200) with a frequency range of 1 Hz–7 MHz and a signal amplitude of 60 mV. To prevent the movement of lithium ions, Au electrodes were deposited on both surfaces of the pellets. Symmetric cells were assembled to assess the critical current density (CCD) and cycling performance. In our experiments, Li/LGLZO-LBS/Li symmetric cells were constructed inside an argon-filled glove box. Thin lithium metal sheets were placed at the center of both sides of the samples, and the symmetric cell was heated at 180 °C for 2 h to minimize the interface resistance between the lithium metal and the samples.   3 Result and discussion X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis is performed to investigate the crystallographic structure of LGLZO samples with different LBS contents, as shown in Fig. 1  . The XRD patterns indicates that the prominent peaks correspond to the cubic garnet structure of LLZO. The observed diffraction peaks are found at 2θ angles of approximately 16.8°, 25.8°, 27.6°, 30.9°, 33.9°, 38.0°, and 43.0°, corresponding to the (211), (321), (400), (420), (422), (521), and (532) crystal planes, respectively. This is consistent with the previously reported literature [21 ]. There is no secondary peak when the LBS content below 3 wt%. However, it can be confirmed that the existence of secondary peak approximately at 33°, indicating the presence of impurity phases (La2 Zr2 O7 ) when the LBS content exceeds 5 wt%. Such finding demonstrates the formation of unwanted materials, resulting from excessive LBS additive [22 ]. The Raman spectra (Fig. 2  ) exhibit prominent vibrational modes of LGLZO to support the structural properties with different concentrations of LBS. All samples deliver identical vibration modes, regardless of LBS contents. The vibrations of the La cations were observed in the range of 100–150 cm⁻124 , while motion of the LiO6  octahedra was detected in the range of 200–300 cm⁻1 . The vibrations of the LiO4  tetrahedra were found in the range of 300–500 cm⁻1 25 . The stretching vibration of the ZrO6  octahedra occurred around 650 cm⁻1 , closely related to the behavior of Zr ions within the LGLZO structure [23 ]. With an increasing LBS content, additional Raman peaks were observed in the spectra, meaning the presence of impurity phases induced by the LBS [22 ]. Notably, when the LBS content is reached up to 5 wt%, extra Raman peaks corresponding to the phases of La2 Zr2 O7  were observed, consistent with Fig. 1 . It can be attributed to the redistribution of lithium ions via LBS introduction. As the LBS content increases, the volatilization of lithium ions of LGLZO is occurred by high sintering temperature. As a result, the LGLZO is partially decomposed, and the lithium ions are redistributed to form an impurity phase (La2 Zr2 O7 ). This phenomenon becomes more pronounced as the LBS content increases, particularly more than 5 wt%, leading to a higher concentration of La2 Zr2 O7  [24 ]. Fig. 3  (a)–(e) show the surface microstructure such as particle size and pore region of the etched LGLZO pellets different LBS contents. The melting point of LBS is as low as 640 °C. Therefore, LBS melts at the grain boundary between LGLZO particles, increasing sinterability and filling pores, thereby, lowering electronic conductivity and Li dendrite growth [22 ]. We can confirm that sintering aid could effectively improve the densification with slightly, but not significantly grain growth due to filling of the preexisting pores by LBS. The Si element, representing LBS uniformly distributed through the unetched LGLZO grains, as shown in Fig. 3 (f) and (g). Especially, the Si element predominately exist in the pore areas between grains, leading to superior the relative density. The relative densities of all samples are summarized in Table 1  . The LGLZO without LBS has an inferior relative density of 90.62 % while LGLZO-10LBS represents a relative density of 95.61 %, which is the highest value than those of other LBS contents (LGLZO-1LBS: 91.57 %, LGLZO-3LBS: 92.92 %, LGLZO-5LBS: 94.83 %) [22 ,25 ]. Fig. 4   shows the DSC measurements to investigate the thermal properties of LGLZO with various LBS content. In case of LGLZO-5LBS and LGLZO-10LBS, a relatively distinct bend corresponding to the glass transition temperature (Tg ) is observed at 280 °C, while there are broad Tg  can be confirmed for LGLZO with low LBS content. A distinct bend in the Tg  indicates that the glass has not completed its crystallization process [22 ]. The two exothermic peaks at 350 °C and 440 °C are associated with the crystallization temperatures (Tc ). It can be confirmed that Tc of LGLZO with higher LBS content seems to be sharp compared to those of LGLZO with lower LBS content. The presence of an exothermic peak is an indication of crystallization degree for LBS. The sharp exothermic peaks demonstrates partially crystallized LBS from glass phase in case of a large amount of LBS concentration. It can be elucidated that high concentration of LBS provides more nucleation sites for crystallization, facilitating the transformation of the glass phase into a crystalline phase. On the other hand, LGLZO with relatively lower LBS content below 3 wt% maintains the glassy phase with almost no crystallization. It indicates that the crystallization behavior which is the formation and growth of crystal structures of the glass is influenced by the LBS concentration [22 ,25 ]. Fig. 5   (a) shows the Nyquist plots of all samples with different various LBS concentration. All samples have an identical shape of one semicircle in the high-frequency region and straight line in the low-frequency region irrespective of LBS concentration. The semicircle is attributed to the combined effect of bulk and grain boundary resistance. To fit the experimental data, a fitting circuit model denoted as (Rb CPEb )(Rgb CPEgb )(CPE) is utilized, where R indicates resistance, CPE indicates constant phase element, and the subscripts b and gb represents to the contributions of bulk and grain boundaries, respectively [26 ].(1) σ = L/(R × S)   Here, σ indicates the Li-ion conductivity, R indicates the total resistance sum of bulk and particle boundaries, and L and S represent the thickness of the LGLZO-LBS pellets and the electrode area, respectively. The Arrhenius plot for obtaining activation energy (Ea ) is shown in Fig. 5 (b). The Ea  values are determined by the slope of the Arrhenius plot, which is related to the temperature dependence of ionic conductivity. The total area conductivities including bulk and grain boundaries for all LGLZO-LBS samples are calculated in the temperature from 20 to 80 °C. The Ea  can be expressed using the Arrhenius equation [27 ]:(2) σ T =  Aexp ( − E a  / kT )       Here, σ represents the ionic conductivity, Ea  represents the activation energy, A represents the pre-exponential factor, T represents the absolute temperature, and k represents the Boltzmann constant. The Ea  values of all samples are summarized in Table 1 . Table 1  presents the ionic conductivity and Ea . The ionic conductivities and Ea  of LGLZO-LBS does not exhibit the same tendency with relative density. We can confirm that both values improve up to 1 wt% of LBS concentration while they deteriorate when LBS content more than 1 wt%. As a result, the LGLZO-1LBS shows the extraordinary values (ionic conductivity (2.64 × 10−3  S/cm−1 ) and Ea  (0.299 eV)) despite slightly low relative density. On the other hand, the LGLZO-10LBS has the lowest ionic conductivity (6.20 × 10−4  S/cm−1 ) and Ea  (0.355 eV) due to the redistribution of the lithium ionse in LGLZO by excessive amount of sintering aid and presence of La2 Zr2 O7 , as mentioned above [23 ]. It is well known that relative density is one of the most important factors for ionic conductivity. However, the ionic conductivity decreases due to the La2Zr2O7, despite of high relative density. Therefore, it can be inferred that appropriate amount of LBS could have a positive effect on the superior ionic conductivity and Ea , originated from rapid and smooth Li-ion diffusion. To understand the formation and propagation of Li dendrites of LGLZO via LBS content, voltage profiles of symmetric cells (Li/LGLZO-LBS/Li) are compared in Fig. 5 (c) −5(f). It has been reported that the formation and propagation of dendrites, which causes short circuits, can be effectively improved by controlling the microstructure such as pore and particle size [28 ]. The electrochemical cycling is measured as the current density increases stepwisely from 0.02 mA cm−2  to 0.6 mA cm−2  All samples exhibit dendrite formation as well as voltage polarization, indicating extremely inferior interface between rough Li metal and LGLZO-LBS and wetting behavior [29 ]. The critical current density (CCD) value represents the highest current density prior to the dramatic voltage reduction. The CCD values is proportional to the ionic conductivity and Ea . The LGLZO-1LBS and LGLZO-3LBS have a better CCD values of 0.38 mA cm−2  and 0.30 mA cm−2 . It can be elucidated that they deliver not only appropriate relative density (LGLZO-1LBS: 91.57 % and LGLZO-3LBS: 92.92 %) and good Ea  but also structural stability without undesired La2 Zr2 O7  phase. More importantly, LGLZO-1LBS has slightly smaller grain size compared to that of LGLZO-3LBS. Thus, LGLZO-1LBS allows contact stiffness of grain boundary, inducing homogeneous current distribution, avoiding current focusing. It can efficiently suppress the Li dendrite propagation and “dead Li” formation [29 ,30 ]. Although LGLZO-5LBS and LGLZO-10LBS have higher relative density, the presence of impurities can inevitably hinder the Li-ion movement, resulting in polarization voltage fluctuation thus, reducing CCD value. Consequently, they exhibit poor CCD values of 0.24 mA cm −2  (LGLZO-5LBS) and 0.16 mA cm −2  (LGLZO-10LBS). To elucidate the stabilization of the LGLZO against the Li dendrite, additional Galvanostatic cycling is performed at room-temperature under a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 , as shown in Fig. 6  (a) and (b). LGLZO-1LBS demonstrates stable long-term cycling, indicating high resistance to dendritic Li formation, whereas LGLZO-10LBS displays the sudden voltage drop (e.g., short-circuit) after only 8 h. Moreover, while the polarization voltage of LGLZI-10LBS is immediately increase to approximately 0.9 V, the LGLZO-1LBS exhibits a stable voltage profile of approximately 0.3 V. This phenomenon indicates that LGLZO-1LBS, with high Li dendrite resistance, is a suitable electrolyte for high performance of all-solid-state battery.  4 Conclusions We investigate the effect of the LBS glass additive on the structural and electrochemical performances of LGLZO. The five various concentrations (1 wt% ∼ 10 wt%) are chosen to examine the microstructure, Li-ion conduction and Li dendrite penetration. The LBS serves as a filler material that occupies the interstitial spaces between LGLZO particles, improving inter-particle connectivity and ionic conductivity. The LGLZO-1LBS sample exhibit the highest ion conductivity (2.64 × 10−3  Scm−1 ) and CCD value of 0.38 mAcm−2  as well as the lowest activation energy (0.299 eV). Such improvement can be attributed to the lithium ions and current density distribution, derived from interaction between both materials. It can facilitate the Li-ion mobility and prevent the short-circuit failure. In the case of LBS of 3 wt% or more, the presence of impurity phases adversely affect the overall electrochemical performances of the LGLZO. Therefore, optimum LBS additive is one of the effective way to obtain high-quality solid-state electrolyte.

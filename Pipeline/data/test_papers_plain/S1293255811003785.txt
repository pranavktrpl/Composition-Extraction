                  Single crystals of the novel compound BaZnRu5O11 were grown from a barium chloride flux. The composition was determined from refinements of single crystal X-ray diffraction data and microprobe analysis. BaZnRu5O11 crystallizes in a supercell of the R-type ferrite structure with doubled a and b unit cell parameters (space group P63/m, Z = 8, a = 11.7411(2) Å, c = 13.6842(4) Å). The reason for the superstructure is the formation of Ru–Ru pairs with short distances within the idealized kagome net extending in (001). No indication of Zn/Ru mixed occupied sites was observed. BaZnRu5O11 does not show any sign of magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K. A large negative Curie–Weiss temperature ΘW
                     
                     ⊥ = −290 K (ΘW
                     
                     || = −230 K) suggests strong Ru3+ (S = ½) antiferromagnetic interactions frustrated on the kagome network of this compound. It is suggested that distortion of the well-ordered kagome sublattice gives rise to unusual behaviour of magnetic and electrical transport properties at low temperatures: BaZnRu5O11 single crystals exhibit a susceptibility

The composition was determined from refinements of single crystal X-ray diffraction data and microprobe analysis. BaZnRu5 O11  crystallizes in a supercell of the R -type ferrite structure with doubled a  and b  unit cell parameters (space group P 63 /m , Z  = 8, a  = 11.7411(2) Å, c  = 13.6842(4) Å). The reason for the superstructure is the formation of Ru–Ru pairs with short distances within the idealized kagome net extending in (001). No indication of Zn/Ru mixed occupied sites was observed. BaZnRu5 O11  does not show any sign of magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K. A large negative Curie–Weiss temperature ΘW  ⊥  =  −290 K (ΘW  ||  =  −230 K) suggests strong Ru3+  (S  = ½) antiferromagnetic interactions frustrated on the kagome network of this compound. It is suggested that distortion of the well-ordered kagome sublattice gives rise to unusual behaviour of magnetic and electrical transport properties at low temperatures: BaZnRu5 O11  single crystals exhibit a susceptibility χ ∼ 1 − T     and electrical resistivity ρ  ∼ T 1.6  below about 10 K which may indicate a non-Fermi liquid.   Graphical abstract      Highlights ► In this study crystals of a novel oxoruthenate were grown. ► The crystal structure reveals kagome nets as one building unit, distorted via Ru–Ru chemical bonds. ► Strong antiferromagnetic interactions are frustrated on the kagome net. ► Below 10 K a non-Fermi liquid behavior was indicated.   Keywords R -type ferrites  Kagome lattice  Magnetic frustration  Non-fermi liquid    1 Introduction Ruthenium oxides, one of the most interesting families of transition metal oxides, have been intensively investigated during the last decades due to their unusual physical properties. One of the most important features of 4d  transition metal oxides is the large spatial extension of d  electron orbitals. The 4d  valence electrons of Ru are, therefore, expected to show weaker localization and should be more conducting than their 3d  analogs. Furthermore, the extended d  orbitals lead to significant d -p  hybridization between the transition metal and oxygen, and enhance also crystalline-electric field effects. These features have shown to be responsible for the diversity of intriguing physical properties in ruthenium oxides (Ref. [1] , and references therein). Recently, we have succeeded in synthesizing ternary ruthenium ferrites with chemical formula (Ba,Sr) M 2 ± x   R u 4 + −  x   O 11      (M  = Fe, Co, Mn), which crystallize in the so-called R -type hexagonal structure [2–5] . The homogeneity range is generated by variable occupation of two octahedrally coordinated metal sites by 3d  and 4d  metals, while a trigonal-pyramidal (tetrahedrally) coordinated site is exclusively occupied by 3d  metals (Fig. 1  ). Within (001) layers of edge-sharing octahedra (M ,Ru)O6  are located, of which the central metal atoms form a kagome sublattice. An especially attractive characteristic of ternary ruthenium ferrites is that the magnetic and electrical properties of these materials can be widely varied by changing the ratio of the 3d /4d  elements within the homogeneity range. It was found that some compositions of Fe-bearing ferrites exhibit a unique coexistence of narrow-gap semiconductivity with ferrimagnetic order below unusually high Curie temperatures TC  ∼ 490 K. The substitution of Fe2+ /Fe3+  for Ru3+ /Ru5+  appears to be vital for the control of the magnetic and transport properties, which makes R -type ferrites attractive for spintronic applications [3] . Furthermore, the consequent replacement of Fe2+ /Fe3+  for Co2+  or for Cu2+  tunes the system from magnetic semiconductors to magnetic or even non-magnetic metals [3,6] . An interesting feature of the R -type ferrites family is that despite the magnetic frustration inherent for this structure, when canted antiferromagnetic order in Co or Mn analogous exists on the kagome planes, it is possible to produce a robust magnetic ground state with non-zero spin-chirality [6,7] . The presence of spin-chirality may play a crucial role in important phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity [8]  and anomalous Hall effect [9–11] . Non-zero scalar chirality is known to drive locally a Hall current and leads to anomalous Hall effect of topological origin, which is independent of the conventional spin-orbit contribution and shows distinct low-temperature behavior. An abnormal Hall effect associated with the non-trivial spin configuration (non-zero scalar chirality) was observed in Co- and Mn-bearing ferrites [6,7] . In this paper we report the magnetic properties of single crystals BaZnRu5 O11 , which are closely related to crystal structure details. We also briefly compare the properties of BaZnRu5 O11  to those of R -type Fe, Co or Mn ferrites investigated in our previous studies [3–5,7] . In contrast to the previously studied members of the R -type family no 3d /4d  disorder is observed in BaZnRu5 O11 . The study of the fully ordered compound would be of great importance since the ordered structure appears to relieve the magnetic frustration within the distorted kagome planes extending in (001). Hence, the formation of different ground states within one structural family and the access to the quantum critical state becomes possible.  2 Experimental Single crystals of BaZnRu5 O11  were grown in the form of black, hexagonal plates from BaCl2  flux, as described elsewhere [2] . Well shaped crystals were selected for single crystal X-ray diffraction data collection. The measurements were performed using a 4 circle diffractometer (NONIUS-κ-CCD, Bruker AXS GmbH) with monochromatic MoK α  radiation. Selected information concerning the data collection and structure refinements are gathered in Tables 1–4     . Further details of the crystal structure investigations may be obtained from Fachinformationszentrum Karlsruhe, 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany (fax: +49-7247-808-666; e-mail: crysdata@fiz-karlsruhe.de , http://www.fiz-informationsienste.de/en/DB/icsd/depot_anforderung.html ) on quoting the deposition number CSD-423536. Chemical μ-probe analyses result in very consistent compositions observed for all crystals investigated, and the inferred atomic density ratios n (Ba)/n (Zn)/n (Ru) = 0.98 ± 1: 0.99 ± 6: 5.01 ± 6 (the oxygen content could not be quantified with this technique) are in excellent agreement with the composition BaZnRu5 O11  obtained from the X-ray diffraction data refinements. No additional elements were detected. The DC magnetization of oriented single crystals was measured over a temperature range 2K ≤ T  ≤ 300 K in applied magnetic fields 0 ≤ μ o H  ≤ 5 T using a Quantum Design MPMS7 Magnetometer. The electrical resistivity was measured by a standard dc-method in the temperature range 1K ≤ T  ≤ 300 K.  3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystal structure Fig. 1  shows the usual unit cell of R -type ferrite compounds, for BaZnRu5 O11  with a  = 5.8706(2) Å and c  = 13.6842(6) Å (in centrosymmetric space group P 63 /mmc ). The crystal structure consists of layers of edge-sharing octahedra RuO6  which are interconnected in [001] direction via face-sharing octahedra-doubles Ru2 O9  and trigonal bipyramids ZnO5 . The latter metal atom within trigonal bipyramids is actually located in one of the two constituting tetrahedra, but typically static or dynamically disordered over both positions depending on temperature. Ordered cases were also described (typical description in the noncentrosymmetric space group P 63 mc ). It is worth pointing out, that the Ru atoms within the planes of edge-sharing octahedra for this subcell are arranged in the motif of an ideal kagome net with distances d (Ru–Ru) = 2.9353(4) Å. This completely ordered arrangement of Ru and Zn within the different coordination environments was earlier described for, e. g ., BaCuRu5 O11 [5]  and no indication for a significant disorder like in (Ba,Sr)M 2 ± x   R u 4 + −  x   O 11      (M  = Fe, Co) could be found [2–4] . These crystal structure refinements are in excellent agreement with the results from chemical analysis via μ-probe resulting in atomic ratios of n (Ba)/n (Zn)/n (Ru) of 0.98 ± 1: 0.99 ± 6: 5.01 ± 6. Taking additional weak superstructure reflections in the X-ray diffraction experiment into account a unit cell with a  = 11.7411(3) Å and c  = 13.6842(6) Å results. The reason for this superstructure lies mostly within the kagome nets, which distort because every two Ru atoms form pairs with short distances d (Ru–Ru) ≈ 2.632(1) Å, while the remaining interatomic separations within the plane are enlarged to about 3.0 Å. Fig. 2   gives an impression of the arrangement of the Ru–Ru pairs within the distorted kagome net. Similar pairing of d 5 -Ru3+  ions is known from, e. g ., β-RuCl3 [12] : In this crystal structure the Ru3+  ions are located in chains of face-sharing octahedra formed from Cl− . In the high-temperature form of RuCl3  above 206 K the Ru along the chain are arranged equidistant with d (Ru–Ru) ≈ 2.827 Å, in the low-temperature phase pair formation is observed with alternating distances of d (Ru–Ru) ≈ 2.633 Å and 3.001 Å. A similar, yet fundamentally different distortion of the kagome lattice of R -type ferrites has been observed, e. g ., for the vanadates NaV6 O11 , SrV6 O11  and PbV6 O11  below 245 K, 320 K, and 560 K, respectively [13] . A more detailed structure discussion is given in another paper on isostructural compounds with the same type of distortion within the kagome plane [14] . It was indicated, that in units built from two face-sharing octahedra Ru2 O9  the Ru–Ru distance is an indicative of the oxidation state of Ru, since the higher the oxidation state the larger the repulsion. The observed separations d (Ru–Ru) = 2.653(2) Å/2.750(3) Å are in the expected range for Ru+4.5  and Ru+5  compared to data taken from a large number of fully ordered 6H -perovskite ruthenates [15,16] . Provided +2 for Ba and Zn and –2 for O charge balance leads to +3 for Ru within the kagome planes and in turn +4.5 for Ru in face-sharing octahedra as likely assignments for oxidation states.  3.2 Magnetic properties The magnetic lattice of BaZnRu5 O11  consists of 4d 5  Ru3+  (S  = ½) ions forming a distorted kagome lattice within the (001) plane, which is separated from the adjacent kagome layers by non-magnetic Zn2+  and doubles of ruthenium, with mixed Ru(IV)/Ru(V) valency according to crystal structure arguments (see above). Fig. 3   shows data for the magnetic susceptibility χ  = M /H  for a BaZnRu5 O11  single crystal oriented perpendicular to the c- axis in an applied field of μH  = 1 T. We did not find any evidence of magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K. A similar behavior of the magnetic susceptibility is observed when magnetic field is applied parallel to the c- axis (Fig. 4  ). As shown in the inset of Fig. 3 , the inverse field-cooled (FC) dc-susceptibility (H⊥c ) presents a change in slope above 50 K and a linear behavior above 100 K. A Curie–Weiss fit of the data in the temperature interval 100 < T  < 300 K gives a Curie–Weiss temperature Θ W⊥  = −290 K and an effective magnetic moment of 2.37 μ B /Ru, which is noticeably lower than the theoretical spin-only value of 3.87 μ B  for Ru5+  (S  = 3/2), and only slightly reduced compared to the spin-only value of μeff   = 2.83 μB  expected for Ru4+  (S  = 1). A deviation in the experimental value of the effective magnetic moment from the theoretical one expected for Ru5+  or Ru4+  could be attributed to strong hybridization between the Ru 4d  and O 2p  electronic states, which often leads to the loss of the local magnetic moment in ruthenium oxides [1]  and to direct Ru–Ru bonding interactions. The susceptibility of single crystals BaZnRu5 O11  is anisotropic and is about two times lower for H ∥c . Above 100 Kχ ∥  follows a Curie–Weiss law with Θ W∥  = −230 K, and μ eff  = 1.78 μ B /Ru (inset in Fig. 3 ). This value is very close to the theoretical spin-only value of μ eff  = 1.73 μ B  expected for trivalent low-spin Ru3+  (S  = ½) in octahedral coordination. The observed difference in effective magnetic moment for two crystallographic directions could be related to the different valence states of Ru within and between the kagome layers. The large negative Curie–Weiss temperature is consistent with the dominance of antiferromagnetic Ru–Ru interactions in the magnetic exchange within and between kagome layers. Therefore, in contrast to the strong ferrimagnets (Ba,Sr)M 2 ± x   R u 4 + −  x   O 11      (M  = Fe, Co, Mn) [4,6,7] , the Zn analogue does not display long-range magnetic order down to 1.8 K. This result points to the presence of much stronger geometrical frustrations in the Zn-bearing compound due to the lack of disorder on the Ru sites of the kagome planes. The magnetization curves of BaZnRu5 O11  are qualitatively the same for both field orientations, i. e. , the isothermal magnetization increases with magnetic field in a linear manner without saturation at the maximum applied field of 5 T, showing a weak anisotropy (Fig. 5  ). This behavior is typical of weak magnetic materials. We focus now our attention on the low-temperature region of the magnetic susceptibility. The low-temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of BaZnRu5 O11  single crystals under a magnetic field of H  = 1 T applied perpendicular or parallel to the c -axis is presented in Fig. 6  . The main result is that the susceptibility below 6 K deviates from the Curie law, exhibiting a non-analytic temperature dependence of the form χ (T ) ∼ 1–T    . The magnetic susceptibility of the sample can be fitted with the following expression:(1) χ = a − b  T   ,    where a  = 8.02 × 10−3  (3.44 × 10−3 ) emu/mol, and b  = 1.77 × 10−3  (4.2 × 10−4 ) emu/mol are the best fitting coefficients for H⊥c  (H ∥c ). The square-root form of the low-temperature behavior of the bulk properties may indicate a non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior, which is frequently observed near low-temperature quantum critical point between paramagnetic and magnetically ordered states in metals with heavy quasiparticles [17] . Therefore, the low-temperature divergence of the magnetic susceptibility suggests the existence of unusual magnetic excitations, whose properties are distinct of those familiar Fermi-liquids. In current NFL theories developed for heavy fermion intermetallics [18] , the role of geometrical frustration in the formation of NFL state near quantum criticality has not received much attention. However, there are indications that the geometrical frustration plays an important role in the development of quantum critical state in a number of metallic magnets based on frustrated lattices [19–22] . This issue remains unsettled and calls for systematic theoretical and experimental studies on a diverse set of novel metallic magnets based on geometrically frustrated lattices. BaZnRu5 O11  seems to be a novel candidate for testing the influence of geometrical frustration on low-temperature properties of metallic magnets. It is instructive to view BaZnRu5 O11  as an ordered version of R -type ferrites with strong magnetic frustrations inherent to the kagome planes located in (001) of this structure. In the isostructural Co-bearing (T c  = 105 K) metallic ferrite there is a 3d /4d  disorder on the kagome net forming sites [4] . Consequently, the magnetic frustrations are reduced and long-range ferro-(ferri)-magnetic ordering occurs at relatively high temperatures. Upon substitution of Co with Zn the structural disorder in the kagome planes disappears. Furthermore, in the Zn-bearing compound, the electrons become more itinerant than in the Co-containing phase, most probably due to an increased number of 3d  electrons and reduction of disorder in the system. Therefore, the magnetic frustrations in the kagome network cannot be removed, and no magnetic ordering is observed in BaZnRu5 O11 . However, Ru spins may still have the tendency to be ordered at very low temperatures due to distortion of the kagome lattice of BaZnRu5 O11  as evidenced from the crystal structure refinement. In this situation the competition between the geometrical frustration and local coupling of Ru3+  spins on distorted kagome lattice may play an essential role in the precise nature of the ground state of BaZnRu5 O11 . The frustration due to lattice geometry in Ru3+  (S  = 1/2) triangular lattice antiferromagnet would result in infinite ground-state degeneracy with no long-range order at any temperature, however, in the presence of lattice distortion the residual interactions between the Ru spins tend to order the system magnetically. If these two processes are about equal in strength, than the system would be lying in the vicinity of a quantum critical point.  3.3 Electrical resistivity The temperature dependences of the in-plane resistivity ρ (T ) of the BaZnRu5 O11  single crystal is shown in Fig. 7  . The positive slope dρ /dT  gt; 0 and small variation of the resistivity from 5.1 to 3.4 mΩ cm as the temperature falls from 300 to 1 K allow to classify this material as a semimetal. Moreover, the basal-plane electrical resistance of our single crystal BaZnRu5 O11  is ρ300 K  about 5 mΩ cm, which is more than three orders of magnitude lower compared to semiconducting (Ba,Sr)F e 2 ± x   R u 4 + −  x   O 11      analogues, and in the range of the typical metal BaCo1.8 Ru4.2 O11 [4] . It is particularly noteworthy that complete replacement of Ru (thought to be mixed valent 3+/5+ [2] ) by Ti4+  yields a wide-gapped insulator [6,23] , while partial replacement of Ru by Co2+ /Co3+  and Cu2+  yields metallic or weakly metallic states with soft ferrimagnetism below room temperature or even a non-magnetic state [4,5] ; and partial replacement of Ru by Fe2+ /Fe3+  yields narrow-gap semiconductors with magnetic transition temperatures as high as 490 K [4,24] . The difference in the transport behavior of R -type ferrites is a consequence of different electronic structures of these materials. As a possible explanation, we suggest that the increase of the density of electronic states as the 3d  metal shifts from Ti to Zn closes a gap at the Fermi surface of Ti- and Fe-bearing ferrites, resulting in metallic behavior of Co-, Cu- and Zn-containing compounds. Below 12 K the resistivity can be fitted to a T 1.6 -dependence. The best fit is shown in the inset of Fig. 7 . In the limit T  → 0 K, the Fermi liquid theory predicts a T 2 -dependence of the electrical resistivity. The reduction of the resistivity exponent below 2 is expected for an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point, since the strong scattering of electrons takes place at particular antiferromagnetic wavevectors around the Fermi surface, allowing larger areas of the Fermi surface to “short out” this strong scattering with conventional Fermi-liquid transport [25] . The deviation of the data from this power law below 12 K is consistent with the NFL behavior and an estimate of the characteristic temperature T  ∼ 10 K derived from the magnetic properties. It is clear that the transport and magnetic properties of BaZnRu5 O11  cannot be explained solely within the Fermi liquid theory. Therefore, we think that BaZnRu5 O11  is a promising candidate to probe geometrical frustration in metallic systems and is likely to reveal new intriguing phenomena in low-temperature physics.   4 Conclusion BaZnRu5 O11  presents an example of an ordered version of R -type ferrites with strong magnetic frustrations inherent to the (001) kagome planes of the crystal structure. The magnetic lattice of this compound is formed by Ru ions, which are coupled antiferromagnetically with a magnetic moment of μeff   = 2.83 μ B  and μeff   = 1.73 μ B  along and perpendicular to the c -axis, respectively. Despite the large negative Weiss temperature ΘW  ⊥  = −290 K (ΘW  ∥ = −230 K) no indication on magnetic order is observed down to 1.8 K in BaZnRu5 O11 . This suggests that the Ru3+  (S  = 1/2) spins are strongly frustrated within the kagome network of this compound. Our magnetic and transport measurements of BaZnRu5 O11  single crystals have indicated an NFL behavior below about 10 K. We speculate that an important role in the formation of this state is played by competition between the geometrical frustration created by a two-dimensional kagome lattice of Ru3+  (S  = 1/2) spins and the residual Ru3+ –Ru3+  spins interaction due to the lattice distortion. Clarification of the exact nature of the NFL state in BaZnRu5 O11  requires further experimental investigations on this material.

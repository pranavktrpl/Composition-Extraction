                  The high-temperature stability, chemical inertness, and enhanced mechanical strength of SiC are utilized for the fabrication of space components. Here, environment-friendly water-based SiC ceramic inks were developed using different size SiC powders. The relation between the SiC particle size and rheological properties is established. The additive manufacturing conditions for SiC are optimized which shows the compressive strength of ∼1.21 MPa. This strength was obtained in the green state for SiC having an average particle size of ∼0.5 μm. As the milling time increases, particle size decreases which make better dispersion in the ink system and it shows good shear-thinning characteristics. The optimum sintering temperature (1400 °C) results in improved compressive strength of ∼80 MPa with a relative density of ∼81%. The current printing method can produce complex ceramic components which can be utilized for manufacturing complex aerospace components.

Handling Editor: Dr P. Vincenzini The high-temperature stability, chemical inertness, and enhanced mechanical strength of SiC are utilized for the fabrication of space components. Here, environment-friendly water-based SiC ceramic inks were developed using different size SiC powders. The relation between the SiC particle size and rheological properties is established. The additive manufacturing conditions for SiC are optimized which shows the compressive strength of ∼1.21 MPa. This strength was obtained in the green state for SiC having an average particle size of ∼0.5 μm. As the milling time increases, particle size decreases which make better dispersion in the ink system and it shows good shear-thinning characteristics. The optimum sintering temperature (1400 °C) results in improved compressive strength of ∼80 MPa with a relative density of ∼81%. The current printing method can produce complex ceramic components which can be utilized for manufacturing complex aerospace components.   Keywords Silicon carbide  Material extrusion  Rheology  Complex structures    1 Introduction Silicon carbide (SiC) ceramics have attracted great attention owing to their outstanding properties such as high-temperature stability, wear resistance, stiffness, thermal conductivity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and density [1 ]. These unique combinations of properties of SiC ceramics result in their versatile applications including aerospace [2 ,3 ], armor [4 ,5 ], nuclear [6 ,7 ], catalyst support [8 ,9 ], energy harvesting [10 ,11 ], energy storage devices [12 ] and aerospace-based optical mirrors and devices [13 ,14 ]. In general, dense SiC ceramics have been fabricated through conventional forming methods such as powder metallurgy via solid-state routes, and hot isostatic pressing processes. However, when large and complicated shapes are required, these conventional processing routes have their limitations. Consequently, the fabrication of dense SiC ceramics with complex structures is still challenging. Additive manufacturing of SiC-based systems attracts lots of interest owing to their multi-functional applications and ability to make complicated structures [15–20 ]. Among all additive manufacturing techniques, the direct ink writing (DIW) of ceramics has drawn much attention towards fabricating complex-shaped ceramics, especially for structures with periodic arrangement [21–23 ]. DIW is a special case under material extrusion-based additive manufacturing processes. The DIW additive manufacturing technique needs an essential prerequisite on the viscoelastic behavior of the ceramic inks, i.e., smooth extrusion without clogging of nozzle and avoiding slumping or deforming of printed ceramic structures. However, different types of ceramic inks have been formulated in recent years [24 ,25 ]. One of the classifications of ink is colloidal suspensions, containing ceramic powders (usually 40–50 by vol% or 60–80 by wt.% of solid loading), organic additives (less than 2 vol%/1 wt%), and a low viscosity medium (water-based) for making a ceramic slurry. There have been very few studies on the fabrication of SiC structures through the DIW process. Chen et al.  reported [26 ] the fabrication of additive-manufactured SiC structures with varying feature sizes (100–400 μm) through the DIW process using polycarbosilane as a SiC source in a hexane solution. Wang and his team [27 ] developed a composite having SiC as matrix and carbon fiber as reinforcement (Cf /SiC) by DIW process combined via liquid silicon infiltration and reported the ultimate tensile and bending strengths of the composites as ∼54 MPa and ∼254 MPa respectively. Held and his research team [28 ] have developed a colloidal aqueous-based SiC/C slurry for the fabricating of SiSiC components, printed through the DIW technique. It was observed that the fabricated composites have a high flexural strength of 190 MPa and an excellent elastic modulus of 246 GPa for printed SiSiC parts. Xia et al. [29 ] have designed Cf /SiC composites through the DIW process with core/shell microstructures and have shown bending strength of ∼121 MPa with ∼31% porosity. Franchin et al. [30 ] reported the fabrication of SiC-based composites from pre-ceramic polymer by using DIW, and observed that the compressive strength of DIW printed composites shows ∼ 4 MPa with ∼75% porosity. Particle size distribution plays an important role in determining mechanical properties, microstructure, and also sintering behavior of green as well as the sintered body. Different particle sizes are obtained by different milling methods. However, longer-time ball milling creates smaller particle sizes, which results in better distribution of particles and enhanced green as well as sintered density. Mostly, the sintering process happens quicker as the particle size reduces because it needs less distance for diffusion between particles. Overall, getting a complicated ceramic structure using conventional ways is tough and involves a lot of pre and post-processing [31 ,32 ]. But using DIW printers and eco-friendly, cheap ink, it is easy to prepare green structures with high solid loading. Moreover, near-net shape structures can be printed directly created from computer-aided design (CAD) software. Though strength is inferior as compared to conventionally prepared samples, the DIW process can be optimized to enhance the strength of the printed ceramics. Hence, it is necessary to understand the whole chemistry and mechanism of preparing ceramic slurry and printing ceramic structures of pure SiC before mixing with any other reinforcement for property enhancement. 3D printing also supports complete automation and industry 4.0 concept which helps continuous monitoring and remote access during printing [33 ,34 ]. This can be utilized in space applications where commands can be sent from earth to spacecraft for maintenance and overhauling requirements. In this study, we developed an inexpensive, non-toxic, and environment-friendly with high solid loading (>50 vol% or ∼77 wt%) SiC ceramic ink for fabricating samples with geometrically complicated structures. The rheological properties of SiC ink derived after a different duration of ball milling are comparatively investigated with the as-received SiC-based ink system. Moreover, the variation of the SiC particle sizes on the mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics of printed SiC structures in the green state as well as in printed sintered SiC structures were studied systematically.  2 Experimental procedure Commercial high-purity SiC powder (α-SiC, density: 3.2 gm/cm3 , purity>99.9%; Nanoshel LLC, United States) with an APS of 60 μm was selected as the primary raw ingredients for ink preparation. Particle size distribution of as-received SiC powders was measured by using an optical microscope (Leica DM2500 M). Analytical grade poly(ethylene glycol) (molecular weight: 400, assay >99%) was used as a dispersant (Sigma-Aldrich Make, Belgium), glycerol was used as a humectant (assay >98%), and poly (vinyl alcohol) PVA (molecular weight: 130000, 99+% hydrolyzed) being used as a binder. Finally, double distilled water was used to prepare the PVA solution (5 wt% by solid weight). Powders, derived from various ball-milling durations (1 h, 3hrs, and 5hrs), were examined through scanning electron microscopy (JSM-IT300HR, JEOL). The particle sizes and crystallinity of 5hrs ball-milled powders along with elemental analysis (EDS) were carried out using HRTEM (FEI, Themis 60-300). The rheological behavior of SiC inks, prepared using different particle sizes obtained via ball milled ran at different time intervals (1hr, 3hrs, and 5hrs), was compared with the as-received powders using a rotational rheometer (Kinexus Pro+, Netzsch, Germany) at room temperature. X-ray diffraction analysis was performed on SiC inks by using an X-ray diffractometer- XRD (Bruker, D8 Advanced, Germany) fitted with Ni-filter and Cu target having Kα radiation of wavelength 1.5406 angstrom, at a scanning speed of 0.02°/min in the 2θ range between 15° to 90°. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of SiC inks was characterized by using an infrared spectrometer (Nicolet 6700, Thermo fisher scientific instruments, USA) in the spectral domain of 400–4000 cm−1 . Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, STA 409/429 Netzsch Gerätebau GmbH, Selb, Germany) of SiC ink was performed at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in argon flows. The ink preparation is comprised of two steps: premix solution preparation followed by adding SiC powders. Firstly, a premix solution was prepared by dissolving PEG (5 wt%), glycerol (10 wt%), and PVA (5 wt%) dissolved in DI water. The weight percentage was measured with respect to DI water. For proper mixing and homogenization of the constituents, a mechanical stirrer was used and rotated at 300RPM for 2hrs above a hot plate kept at 90 °C. Subsequently, the SiC powders were added to the premix solution to formulate the required composition of SiC inks for printing purposes (tabulated in Table 1  ). Then, the ink is kept inside a desiccator for 1 h to get rid of entrapped air bubbles. Later, the ink was filled into a syringe for printing purposes. An extrusion-based printer (Hyrel-HR) is used for the DIW process. At first, the syringe (50 mL) with a circular cross-section was loaded with the required volume of the prepared slurry and extruded through a nozzle having a diameter of 0.9 mm. The printing parameters were set with a cross-slide velocity of 200 mm/s, 0.5 mm layer thickness, a volumetric flow rate of 90 mm3 /min, and bed temperature kept at ambient conditions. As the diameter of the nozzle is 0.9 mm, each layer's thickness should be approximately half of its diameter, and hence 0.5 mm layer thickness has been chosen. Parameters used in the printing process have been optimized after conducting hit and trial methods. If the flow rate of the ink is more than 90 mm3 /min then an overflow of liquid happens which distorts the desired structure of the sample. Moreover, if the nozzle diameter is less than 0.9 mm then clogging happens, and more than that the resolution of the printed structure decreases. The ink viscosity is so maintained that it flows smoothly without being dried inside the nozzle. The inks were deposited on a glass plate to get the first layer and then subsequent layers were printed to get a final three-dimensional (3D) structure. Initially, Solidworks 2020 was used to model the desired 3D structures and then converted into 3D printer-compatible.stl file format. The Schematic of the DIW has been shown in Fig. 1  . After completing the printing process, the as-printed 3D structures kept on the printing platform (glass plate) were kept for drying at 100 °C for 12 h in an oven to get desired green strength for further study. Finally, to investigate the strength of the printed body at elevated temperatures, the additive-manufactured green body was heat treated at 1400 °C for 2 h in argon flows with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Uniaxial compression tests of additive-manufactured green bodies were performed on the cylindrical shaped samples based on the ASTM C773  standard by using Universal Testing Machine (UTM- Instron 3365, Instron, USA) with a capacity of 50 kN. In this study, tests were conducted in displacement control mode with a strain rate of 1 mm/min at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The Young's modulus and hardness of the printed green body were determined using a Nanoindentation tester (Anton Paar, GmbH, Germany), where a maximum load of 10 mN and a load rate of 20 mN/min with an acquisition rate of 10Hz were applied to the samples having a dwell time of 10 s in between the loading and unloading cycle. Alongside, the microhardness of the printed green body was determined by using a Vickers hardness tester (VM50, Fuel Instruments & Engineers Pvt. Ltd., Maharastra, India) equipped with a maximum load capacity of 50kgf. In this study, a maximum load of 1kgf was applied to the green body and the average hardness was determined from the diagonal size of the square indents with the help of an optical microscope. The surface roughness of the printed sample was characterized using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM, Agilent Technologies, Inc). The fractured surfaces of the printed green body and sintered structures were carried out using scanning electron microscopy (JSM-IT300HR, JEOL). The compression tests of printed SiC structures sintered at different temperatures (1000 °C, 1200 °C, and 1400 °C) for 2 h in an argon atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 °C/min were performed using a UTM.  3 Results & discussions As-received SiC powders were ball milled in a self-designed vibratory ball mill system (Tau instruments, Bangalore, India) at different milling periods (1 h, 3 h, 5 h) using a 250 gms hardened steel ball (powder to steel ball ratiõ1:250) until the particle size was under 10 μm. After ball milling, the powders were collected and stored for ink preparation. Fig. 2   depicts the microstructures of SiC particles. Optical images of as-received SiC powders used in this study are displayed in Fig. 2 (a). The APS of as-received SiC powders is ∼60 μm with normal distribution as shown in the inset of Fig. 2 (a). The as-received SiC powders exhibit an uneven flat appearance with high roughness. Fig. 2 (b and c) demonstrates the SEM images of SiC powders after 1 h and 5 h ball milling. It is observed that the particles are in the agglomerated state because of the increased surface area of SiC particles after ball-milling. The APS of 1 h and 5 h ball-milled powders are ∼5 μm, and 0.5 μm, respectively shown in the inset of Fig. 2 (b and c). It is observed that with increasing milling durations particle size reduces. Furthermore, TEM microscopy of 5hrs ball-milled powders is carried out to confirm the particle sizes displayed in Fig. 2 (d). The elemental analysis is done using energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS/EDX) which shows the presence of silicon and carbon with traces amount of oxygen in the sample shown in the inset of Fig. 2 (d). This may be ascribed due to the formation of a native oxide layer on top of the SiC particle. For more clarity, the raw data of EDS/EDX from TEM has been provided in the supplementary section (See Fig. S1 ). The report also confirms that there are no traces of contamination that might be present from the ball milling process using a hardened steel ball. HRTEM image shows the particle size and crystallinity of SiC particles Fig. 2 (e and f). The magnified HRTEM image demonstrates some areas with ordered lattice (as marked with white arrows) and other areas with distorted lattice arrangements of atoms (as marked with yellow arrows) in Fig. 2 (f). The disordered lattice formation is due to stress induced during the ball milling process. This confirms the impact energy generated via the hardened steel balls is enough to fracture the SiC particles to reduce their size due to fracture. The rheological behavior of ceramic inks is the prerequisite criterion in the DIW printing process for fabricating complicated structures. The formulated ink should maintain its shear thinning behavior, i.e., a reduction of viscosity (η) at a high shear rate which ensures a smooth extrusion of inks without nozzle clogging. Therefore, inks (one as-received SiC powder and the others with different particle sizes SiC powders) with the same compositions as provided in Table 1  were developed and compared to their ink's rheological behavior. The variations of viscosity and shear stress with respect to shear rates of all SiC inks at the ambient condition as shown in Fig. 3  (a) and Fig. 3 (b), respectively. The results showed that the viscosity of SiC inks is largely dependent on the particle size which is obtained by varying ball milling durations. It is observed that with increasing milling times the particle size reduces and the viscosity of inks increases. It was found that the viscosity was 16 Pa-s and 30 Pa-s, 28 Pa-s, and 25 Pa-s for as-received and inks derived using 5 h, 3 h, and 1 h ball-milled SiC powders respectively performed at a low shear rate of ∼15 s−1 . Initially, it can be observed that ink prepared from as-received powders shows less viscosity as compared to ink prepared using SiC powders obtained from varying ball mill durations. This is due to the large size of particles of as-received SiC are not closely packed and hence do not hold the particles and solution together to have a uniform homogeneous mixture. On the other hand, ball-milled SiC particles are small enough to initiate intermixing of particles and solution with one another in the ink resulting in a uniform homogeneous slurry with high loading of SiC. The results implied that with increasing shear rates the η of all SiC inks decreases which proves the ink's shear-thinning actions. It observed that when the shear rate is reached a certain value of ∼30 s− 1 , the η of as-received SiC powder-based ink increases with an increase in the shear rate but it dropped abruptly when the shear rate reaches a particular value, and hence larger particles of as-received SiC were clogged inside the nozzle inhibiting the printing process. Meanwhile, SiC ink prepared using different particle sizes shows higher viscosity than ink formulated from as-received SiC powders. This may be ascribed due to the better surface area of ball-milled powders as compared to as-received SiC particles. Alongside, the inks derived from different-sized particles show sufficient yield stress (more than 400 Pa) as shown in Fig. 3 (b), i.e., provide adequate strength to retain additive manufactured structures in green conditions and bear self-weights during the printing process. However, inks derived from as-received SiC particles exhibited low yield stress value (∼250 Pa) thereby revealing the inability to provide sufficient strength to its structure while printing. One more inference that can be deduced from the rheological tests is that with longer ball mill duration and reduction in particle size, the viscosity of the prepared slurry increases which has a direct effect on the mechanical properties of the green body. The reason for being more viscous is the possibility of higher solid loading of SiC particles in the pre-ink solution. Fig. 3 (c) demonstrates the X-ray diffraction patterns of inks derived using different milling times (1hr, 3hrs, and 5hrs) SiC powders. It reveals that all peaks are consistent with the pure α-SiC (JCPDS-98-000-5604) and the presence of a little amount of impurity phase like SiO2 , which is located at 2θ∼ 26.26°, which is also confirmed by elemental analysis using TEM. All inks are confirmed by indexing six strong diffraction peaks to α-SiC (6H) at 34.09°, 35.60°, 35.65°, 38.13°, 59.93°, and 60.00° suggesting the phases of SiC associated with the (011), (006), (012), (013), (018), and (110) crystallographic planes respectively. The crystallite sizes of inks formulated with powders milled at different times are shown in Fig. 3 (d). It was found that with increasing milling time the crystallite size decreases (88 nm-1hr, 69 nm-3hrs, and 55 nm-5hrs) which is estimated by using the Debye Scherrer formula. In addition, the FTIR spectroscopy of inks demonstrates two absorption peaks centered at ∼750 cm−1  and 1050 cm−1 , which corresponds to the Si–C and Si–O bonds, respectively as shown in Fig. 3 (e). Therefore, the existence of the Si–O bond is attributed to the formation of an oxide layer on the surface of the SiC particle and has a good agreement with the elemental analysis of TEM. Fig. 3 (f) illustrates the TGA curve of ink derived from 5hrs milled powders, which shows a weight loss of ∼2–3 wt% (relative to total solid loading). This accounts for PEG and glycerol used as dispersants and humectants in the ink system occurring between 100 and 180 °C, followed by binder PVA decomposition and volatilization at ∼300 °C. This also ensures at what temperature and at what heating rate and holding time the sintering cycle should be completed to get rid of all the binders and other ingredients and obtain a pure sintered SiC ceramic structure. Compression tests were performed on the printed samples using different particle sizes. In this study, a reasonable discrepancy in the mechanical properties of printed structures as a function of different particle sizes was obtained from different milling times from the stress-strain curve as depicted in Fig. 4  (a). It was found that with increasing milling time the compressive strength of printed green bodies increases. The increased milling time improves the ultimate compressive strength (UCS) of printed SiC green bodies from 0.73 to 1.21 MPa while yield strength increased from 0.57 to 1.14 MPa as shown in Fig. 4 (b). It might be because with increasing milling time from 1hr to 3hrs–5hrs, the particle size decreases and the compactness of the printed green bodies increases with better interlocking that requires higher stress to break the bonding between smaller particles. The overall green strength of printed SiC structure using 5hrs milled powders has the highest strength. Thus, the mechanical properties of additive-manufactured green SiC structures were significantly enhanced by increasing the milling time. Fig. 4 (c) demonstrates the nanoindentation characterization of printed green SiC structure using 5 h milled powders. In the present study, nanoindentation measurements are used for the calculation of Young's modulus and hardness of the printed green structure by using the Berkovich tip penetrating a depth of ∼3400 nm inside the printed structure. Fig. 4 (c) shows a typical load-displacement curve showing the loading and unloading cycle using Berkovich indenters. It was observed that the loading cycle follows certain changes in the slope while increasing the depth. These sudden changes in the slope are called pop-in events, which are shown in Fig. 4 (c) with indicated arrow marks. Pop-in events may be ascribed due to defects present in the system such as pores, dislocation activity, slip, etc. It is also found that at the end of the loading path, the creep phenomenon happened as the displacement occurs at a constant load kept for 10 s. At the initial stages of the unloading cycle, the creep effect is still present, and the displacement remains constant even after the tip had begun to pull back from the surface of the printed structure. Also, in the unloading curve, the pop-out effect was not noticed in the system. The calculated Young's modulus and hardness of printed SiC green structure from nanoindentation characterization of the samples are 1.84 GPa and 33.4 MPa respectively. These values are relatively lower compared to other forms of SiC which may be due to the presence of voids and relative motions between the SiC particles and tip in the green state. Alongside, the optical micrograph of indenters is shown in Fig. 4 (d), and the Vickers hardness of the printed green structure was calculated which was found to be 19.82 kgf/mm2 . Surface roughness or surface profile (Ra ) plays an important role in predicting the printing efficiency of layered structures and hence their mechanical properties. AFM characterization was utilized to ascertain the surface roughness of the printed green body. A scanning area of 5 × 5 μm was selected for the sample for examination. Fig. 4 (e) shows AFM micrograph of the printed green body using 5hrs milled SiC particles. It was observed that SiC particles in the printed layer showed irregular flat shape-like features with a sub-micron size of grains. Furthermore, AFM micrograph was also used to calculate the surface roughness of the printed layer. It was found that the average Ra  value is 92 nm which was determined using the Gwyddion software shown in Fig. 4 (f). The surface roughness value is very low, indicating the surface is very smooth and hence should not create problems during the printing process while stacking layers one above the other and can create a compact green structure with little voids/empty spaces. The fractured surface morphology of additive manufactured SiC green structure using 5 h milled powder is shown in Fig. 5  (a). The samples fired at different temperatures are also depicted in Fig. 5 (b and c), respectively. It is observed that the printed green structure and sample heat treated at 1000 °C possess porous microstructure which gradually diminishes with sintering at a higher temperature (1200 °C) as shown in Fig. 5 (c). The uneven shapes of SiC powders have impacted the packing density of the printed structure and thus create pores in the SiC structure. The pores are obtained due to calcining of organic additives (PEG, glycerol, and PVA) used in the formulation of SiC ink. Fig. 5 (f) demonstrates the microstructures of SiC printed structures sintered at 1400 °C. The dense structure which was obtained at 1400 °C, has a little amount of silica present before the experiment as a native oxide layer on the surface of SiC particles, which may help to happen liquid phase sintering in the structure. The number of pores decreases with increasing sintering temperature from 1000 °C to 1400 °C may be due to the increased inter-particle diffusion mechanism. Fig. 5 (d) shows the SEM image of SiC particles ball milled for 1hr duration, Fig. 5 (e) for 3hrs duration, and Fig. 5 (f) for 5hrs duration sintered at 1400 °C. It is observed that as the densification of the sintered body is more pronounced for 5hrs ball milled samples sintered at 1400 °C. The fractured surfaces of printed SiC ceramics sintered at 1400 °C for 2h with different particle sizes ball-milled for different durations are depicted in Fig. 5 (d–f). The porosity of printed samples is reduced (as obvious from the microstructure) and also the density increases with increasing the milling times. The quantity of pores is almost invisible from the fractured morphology of the samples prepared from 5hrs ball-milled powders as shown in Fig. 5 (f). However, in this study, it is concluded that the increase in milling time is an effective strategy to encourage the densification behavior of SiC ceramics by decreasing the particle size. This ultimately enhances the mechanical strength of the printed structures. The apparent porosity (AP) and bulk density (BD) of DIW printed samples using different ball milling durations sintered at 1400 °C were estimated using the Archimedes principle as per ASTM C373-88 . At first, dry weights were taken of the sintered samples and then immersed in water under a vacuum of 4 mm of mercury for 10 h to ensure the entering of water inside the pores entirely. Later, the suspended and soaked weights were measured. The apparent porosity and bulk density were calculated as per the following formula:A P  ( % )  = { ( W − D )  / ( W − S )  }  x 100    B D = D / ( W − S )          where AP is the apparent porosity, BD is bulk density and W is the soaked weight, D is the dry weight and S is the suspended weight. The average AP has been calculated (3 samples) for each composition as per ASTM standards and the results are consistent. The actual or relative density (RD) of the printed sintered samples are 65%, 77%, and 80% for 1 h, 3hrs, and 5 h respectively. These results correspond to the porosity of the printed samples being between 20 and 35%. These values are well below as compared to conventionally prepared samples (RD:∼95%) as ink binder and other ingredients occupy some volume of the prepared slurry and in process of sintering get pyrolyzed. The average RD of the printed sintered samples was estimated as per the formula:R D  ( % )  = ( E x p e r i m e n t a l  d e n s i t y / T h e o r e t i c a l  d e n s i t y )  * 100      With an increase in ball milling duration, the particle size decreases, reducing the open pores, and hence the AP decreases. This ultimately improves the BD of the printed sintered structures. Hence there is a direct correlation between milling time and BD. As the BD increases, the mechanical properties of the printed sintered samples get improved as confirmed by the comprehension test as discussed later. Fig. 6   demonstrates the compressive properties of DIW-printed SiC structures sintered at different temperatures. As the sintering temperature increases from 1000 °C to 1400 °C, the compressive stress required to crack the sample increases which may be due to the increase in density with increasing temperature as shown in Fig. 6 (a). It was found that the compressive strength increases from 21 MPa at 1000 °C to 72 MPa at 1400 °C shown in Fig. 6 (b) which is evitable from the fractured surface morphology of printed SiC structures sintered at different temperatures shown in Fig. 5  (b, c) and Fig. 5 (f), respectively. The highest strength was observed at 1400 °C. Fig. 6 (c and d) illustrates the variation of compressive properties of printed SiC structures sintered at 1400 °C with the variation in milling time. The increase in compressive strengths with increasing milling time may be attributed to the reduced particle size which increases the initial compactness in the green state during printing. Moreover, the bulk density of printed samples increases with increasing milling times which is comparable with the results obtained as shown in Table 2  . This results in the overall strength of printed SiC structures sintered at the fixed temperature of 1400 °C shown in Fig. 6 (d). One more observation is that the effect of sintering temperature is more pronounced than the effect of ball milling duration to enhance the mechanical compressive strength of the printed structure. However, an optimum strength can be achieved by the combined effect of both sintering temperature and ball milling duration. Fig. 7   shows pictures of different 3D models and corresponding printed green structures for different applications. A porous SiC cylindrical structure, with an outer diameter of 18 mm and wall thickness of 0.9 mm using a nozzle size of 0.9 mm was additive-manufactured as shown in Fig. 7 (a). Fig. 7 (b) depicts the porous structure with a honeycomb pattern with a dimension of the wall thickness of 0.9 mm and the side of one hexagon is 2.5 mm long. Alongside, Fig. 7 (c) shows a porous log pile structure with a dimension of (15 mm × 15 mm), with a diameter of one rod of 0.9 mm and a length of the rod is 15 mm with a gap between two rods of 2.5 mm. Various 3D structures with different complicated shapes were demonstrated to indicate the great ability of the DIW technique for the additive manufacturing of SiC ceramics. The ink formulation used for the current work is nontoxic and eco-friendly which can be readily mixed with SiC without much difficulty in mixing and handling. The premix solution ingredients are designed and selected in such a way that allows maximum solid loading either by volume (>50%) or by weight (>75%) so that during sintering a dense structure with high relative density can be achieved. The current work opens new opportunities to tune the density and hence the mechanical properties. The process can be utilized to control porosity in the additive-manufactured samples. Fig. 8   describes the dependency of compressive strength on the relative density of the prepared structure. The data have been taken from a wide range of manufacturing techniques available in literature including DIW for SiC and its composites. Fig. 8  also shows where the current work stands (Red encircled). The relative density of the additive manufactured structure is around 81% which is comparable to the state of the art (as shown in the map). Moreover, the compressive strength of the additive manufactured structure sintered at 1400 °C is found to be 80 MPa.  4 Conclusions In this study, SiC structures were successfully fabricated through DIW using a range of particle sizes starting from microns to the sub-micron level obtained by varying milling durations (1 h, 3hrs, and 5 h). The extrudable SiC inks were prepared by using an environmental-friendly aqueous binder system (5 wt% PVA), combined with a humectant (∼4 vol% glycerol). The sub-micron SiC particles require a higher amount of dispersant (∼2–3 vol % PEG) as the surface area of SiC particles is increased compared to as-received SiC (A.P.S∼60 μm) to obtain a homogeneous printable ink. Through this, SiC inks (∼50 vol% SiC solid loading) demonstrate excellent printability under low applied shear stress using a fine nozzle size (∼900 μm) and maintain the shape and integrity of the printed structure without bulging or deforming. Also, the effects of variation of milling time and the sintering conditions on the mechanical properties and microstructural characterization of printed green SiC structures were investigated in detail. There is a direct correlation between milling hours and sintering temperature with the mechanical strength of the printed structure. It is found that with more milling time (5hrs) and higher sintering temperature (1400 °C), the mechanical strength of the samples increases. More the milling time, the higher the reduction in particle size and voids and hence more interlocking of particles during sintering at a higher temperature. Moreover, the BD also increases as the milling duration is increased. The mechanical properties of additive-manufactured SiC are comparable to the state of art printed structures. Overall, through this study, it is concluded that the effect of milling time provides a better understanding of printability, mechanical properties, and microstructural characteristics of DIW printed green parts as well as sintered structures of SiC ceramics.

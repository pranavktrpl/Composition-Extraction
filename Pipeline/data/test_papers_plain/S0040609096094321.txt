                  Porous ceramic filters have applications in many industrial areas. The major requirements for filter materials are high porosity, high mechanical strength and uniform pore size. However, conventional fabrication methods cannot produce materials with both high porosity and high strength, since an increase in porosity usually results in a decrease in strength. A method has been reported to obtain porous materials of high strength and high porosity by hot isostatic pressing (HIP), because the high pressurised gas prevents shrinkage of open pores and enhances bridging of particles.
                  In the present study several commercial Al2O3 starting powders were uniaxially and isostatically pressed and the green compacts were directly treated under different HIP conditions. The microstructure (grain size and shape, density and pore size distribution) of the HIP products was evaluated and then compared to that of the traditionally sintered ones in order to investigate the influence of starting powder characteristics, forming process and thermal treatment parameters on the characteristics of the final materials. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.

The major requirements for filter materials are high porosity, high mechanical strength and uniform pore size. However, conventional fabrication methods cannot produce materials with both high porosity and high strength, since an increase in porosity usually results in a decrease in strength. A method has been reported to obtain porous materials of high strength and high porosity by hot isostatic pressing (HIP), because the high pressurised gas prevents shrinkage of open pores and enhances bridging of particles. In the present study several commercial Al2 O3  starting powders were uniaxially and isostatically pressed and the green compacts were directly treated under different HIP conditions. The microstructure (grain size and shape, density and pore size distribution) of the HIP products was evaluated and then compared to that of the traditionally sintered ones in order to investigate the influence of starting powder characteristics, forming process and thermal treatment parameters on the characteristics of the final materials. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.   Keywords Aluminium oxide  Hot isostatic pressing  Ceramics  Fabrication    1 Introduction Porous ceramic materials offer a number of useful properties including low density, high-temperature stability, permeability, high surface area and thermal shock resistance. Porous ceramics, especially open pore materials, are important for industrial applications as filters. The major requirements for such filter materials are sufficiently high porosity, high mechanical strength and uniform pore size. It is, however, difficult, by the conventional processes, to simultaneously satisfy the requirements for porosity and strength, because they are frequently contradictory. A method has been reported [1–5] to improve the mechanical properties of ceramic materials while retaining adequate porosity by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) of as-pressed powders, because the high gas pressure prevents densification and enhances bridging between particles. Moreover this method favours the elimination of microcracks and closed pores [1] . Preliminary results of a study aimed to obtain porous Al2 O3 , one of the most widely used porous ceramics, especially for filters, starting from several commercial powders, are presented. Bulk Al2 O3  samples were produced by HIP and the final microstructure was correlated to the process controlling factors such as starting powder characteristics, forming process and thermal treatment parameters.  2 Experimental procedures Five commercial Al2 O3  powders were selected: RC-HP DBM (Reynolds), A-16 (Alcoa), Baikalox CR30 (Baikowski Chemie), Ceralox APA 0.5 and Ceralox HPA 0.5 (Condea). The physical and chemical characteristics of the raw powders are shown in Table 1  . All the powders were characterised by narrow particle size distribution and regular-shaped particles. The as-received powders were uniaxially pressed at a pressure of 50 MPa to make pellets of about 10 mm of diameter and 6 mm thick. The pellets were then cold isostatically pressed at 50 MPa×1 min or 100 MPa×1 min in order to evaluate the influence of the forming pressure on the final material. The green density was measured by the weight/volume ratio. Samples were then hot isostatically pressed (QIH-15, ABB) under a pressure of 100 MPa in Ar at 1250 °C and 1300 °C×1 h. A typical HIP schedule is reported in Fig. 1  . In order to verify the effectiveness of such a process a conventional pressureless sintering cycle in air at 1300 °C×1 h was also carried out. Density, porosity and pore size distribution of HIP and sintered materials were determined by mercury porosimeter (Macropore 120 and Porosimeter 2000, Carlo Erba). The internal structure of sintered and HIP samples was analysed by scanning electron microscopy on fracture surfaces. In order to test the effect of the HIP treatment on the strength of the materials, 25×3×2 mm3  bars, uniaxially pressed at 50 and 100 MPa, were obtained underwent HIP at 1300 °C under the same conditions of the pellets and then four-point bend tested to evaluate the flexural strength.  3 Results and discussion Values of bulk and relative densities and average pore sizes, together with green densities and cold isostatic pressing (CIP) pressures, for the HIP and the pressureless sintering treatments are reported in Table 2  . It is worth noting that in the majority of samples the resultant porosity was higher than 30%, the value usually found in commercial ceramic filters. Generally the mercury porosimeter measurements showed that both pressureless sintered and HIP samples had a uniform pore size distribution with one maximum peak. 3.1 Effect of heat treatment conditions on porosity and microstructure Decrease of the maximum HIP temperature from 1300 °C to 1250 °C resulted in a decrease of the bulk density (Table 2 ) and of the material grain size, as noticeable from comparison of Fig. 2  (a) and 2(b). The average pore size values reported in Table 2  do not show significant variations. According to the literature [2] , the dominant sintering mechanism for Al2 O3  is surface diffusion at low temperatures or at the beginning of sintering, followed by volume diffusion; the surface diffusion does not result in shrinkage but in the formation of solid bonds between adjacent particles. In HIP, the enhanced surface diffusion delays the transition from surface-dominant to volume-dominant diffusion but, at the lower HIP temperature (1250 °C), bridges between particles were poorly developed, suggesting that surface diffusion is not sufficiently effective at the particular temperature and pressure conditions. The HIP treatment at 1300 °C, however, promoted neck formation between particles by diffusion, giving rise to the microstructure shown in Fig. 3  . The relative density of the pressureless sintered samples was generally higher than that of the HIP ones, since during the pressureless sintering process there is no obstacle to the shrinkage which is prevented in the HIP treatment by the high pressurised gas. Moreover, in most cases the HIP process produced a narrower pore size distribution and finer grain size than pressureless sintering, as shown by comparison of Fig. 4  (a) and 4(b), because small pores shrink and disappear faster than large ones under high-pressure gas [4] . Conversely, in samples obtained with Baikalox CR30 and Ceralox HPA 0.5 (powder characterised by high specific surface area and fine particle size), the materials achieved higher densities when treated with HIP rather than when pressureless sintered, the previous trend was even more remarkable in samples formed at the higher CIP pressure (100 MPa). In addition the larger grain size was obtained by HIP, unlike the behaviour of the other starting powders. In Fig. 5  (a) and 5(b), the grain morphologies of samples of Al2 O3  Ceralox HPA 0.5 HIP and pressureless sintered are compared. The observed behaviour may result from the high specific surface area of the powders with a very high surface energy enhancing densification. Probably the presence of very small sized porosity in the green bodies could reduce the effect of the pressurised gas in preventing shrinkage during HIP, since the pressure effect is stronger for large pores than for small ones. Small pores behave similarly under high or low pressure, and disappear faster than larger ones [2] .  3.2 The effect of forming pressure on porosity and strength The forming pressure influenced both pore size distribution and strength. The pore size distribution curves are shifted towards minor pore sizes when CIP pressure is increased from 50 to 100 MPa (an example is shown in Fig. 6  ), resulting from a decreased distance between the grains. On the other side, increase of CIP pressure from 50 to 100 MPa increases the density of the green bodies up to 4% but, in many cases (Table 2 ), the relative densities after HIP are almost similar, regardless of CIP pressure. However, increase of the forming pressure increases flexural strength (Fig. 7  ), probably due to the reduction of flaws, such as cracks, and/or to the increased contact area between the grains which, during HIP, results in bigger necks, improving the material strength with little loss in open porosity.  3.3 Effects of powder characteristics on strength Among the tested powders, the highest strength values were obtained with Reynolds (up to 200 MPa) and Ceralox HPA 0.5 (up to 180 MPa), while Baikalox and Ceralox APA 0.5 resulted in very low strength values. In the case of Baikalox, the low strength can be associated with its high specific surface area and spherical particles inducing low green (∼40%) and final (41–48%) densities. The low values in the case of Ceralox APA 0.5 can be due to the presence of hard aggregates in the powder, acting as critical flaws when the sample undergoes tensile strength testing, or to forming defects, such as cracks, resulting in premature failure, or to a weakening effect due to distribution and morphology of the porosity. A further important factor is that the two materials, unlike the others, showed lower pore sizes at the highest CIP pressure. Therefore it is suggested that, as the mercury porosimeter cannot separate fine pores and the open space near the bridges among grains [6] , both the materials, Baikalox and Ceralox APA 0.5, could present a porous structure with very small bridges or opening spaces near the bridges, leading to low mechanical strength.   4 Conclusions Porous ceramics with properties suitable for filters can be prepared by HIPing as-received commercial Al2 O3  powders. In all cases, the pore diameters range in a nanometer scale, from ∼80 to ∼100 nm. The HIP treatment at 1250 °C gives rise to poorly developed bridges between particles, while at 1300 °C the process leads to the formation of more solid necks, together with increasing bulk density and material grain size. The HIP process produces narrower pore size distribution and finer grain size than pressureless sintering, even if density, pore and grain size of the final products depend on grain size, sinterability and texture of the green bodies, all depending on grain size, shape and specific surface area of the starting powders. Powders of very fine particle size give rise to very small sized green porosity which is insensitive to the effect of the high pressurised gas. The widely different strength values (from ∼70 to ∼200 MPa) are mainly influenced by the powder characteristics, and depend slightly on the forming pressure: increase of forming pressure causes the reduction of flaws in the bulk material and promotes the formation of bridges between grains. For high strength materials, powders with grain size and shape which give rise to very fine green porosity or to a structure rich in opening space among the bridges, have to be avoided. Further activities are in progress in order to correlate the material characteristics to the gas permeability.    References 1 K. Ishizaki, A. Takata and S.

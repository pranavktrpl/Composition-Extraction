                  To alleviate agglomeration and refine the particle size, a novel sol-gel-flux method (SGFM) was applied to synthesise ZrO2 (1Y6Ce–ZrO2) nanoparticles (NPs) stabilised by 1 mol% Y2O3 and 6 mol% CeO2. Both the NaCl and NaCl + KCl flux systems were investigated. The effects of calcination temperature and holding time on the phase composition and morphology of the NPs were studied, and the sintering performances of the 1Y6Ce–ZrO2 NPs prepared in the two flux systems were compared. The results showed that the optimum temperature for the preparation of 1Y6Ce–ZrO2 NPs by SGFM could be reduced from 800 to 700 °C if the NaCl system was replaced by the NaCl + KCl system. The lower calcination temperature resulted in well-dispersed tetragonal 1Y6Ce–ZrO2 NPs with an average grain size of 14.5 nm and quasi-spherical morphology. 1Y6Ce–ZrO2 NPs prepared in the NaCl + KCl system exhibited better sintering performance than 1Y6Ce–ZrO2 NPs prepared in the NaCl system. The 1Y6Ce–ZrO2 ceramics obtained by sintering the former showed higher stability at high temperatures, smaller grain sizes, and narrower grain size distributions, which are conducive to improving the mechanical properties of 1Y6Ce–ZrO2 ceramics. Fully tetragonal 1Y6Ce-TZP ceramic with an average grain size of 0.68 μm and a relative density of 98.49% were obtained by pressureless sintering of the former at 1400 °C for 2 h.

To alleviate agglomeration and refine the particle size, a novel sol-gel-flux method (SGFM) was applied to synthesise ZrO2  (1Y6Ce–ZrO2 ) nanoparticles (NPs) stabilised by 1 mol% Y2 O3  and 6 mol% CeO2 . Both the NaCl and NaCl + KCl flux systems were investigated. The effects of calcination temperature and holding time on the phase composition and morphology of the NPs were studied, and the sintering performances of the 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs prepared in the two flux systems were compared. The results showed that the optimum temperature for the preparation of 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs by SGFM could be reduced from 800 to 700 °C if the NaCl system was replaced by the NaCl + KCl system. The lower calcination temperature resulted in well-dispersed tetragonal 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs with an average grain size of 14.5 nm and quasi-spherical morphology. 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs prepared in the NaCl + KCl system exhibited better sintering performance than 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs prepared in the NaCl system. The 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  ceramics obtained by sintering the former showed higher stability at high temperatures, smaller grain sizes, and narrower grain size distributions, which are conducive to improving the mechanical properties of 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  ceramics. Fully tetragonal 1Y6Ce-TZP ceramic with an average grain size of 0.68 μm and a relative density of 98.49% were obtained by pressureless sintering of the former at 1400 °C for 2 h.   Keywords Sol-gel-flux method  1Y6Ce–ZrO2   Nanoparticles  Refined particle size  Sintering    1 Introduction Polycrystalline tetragonal zirconia ceramics possess excellent mechanical properties, which are derived from the stress-induced phase transformation of the metastable tetragonal phase (t) to monoclinic phase [1–4 ]. Stabilisers such as Y2 O3  and CeO2  are commonly used to retain the tetragonal phase at room temperature. Polycrystalline tetragonal zirconia stabilised with 3 mol% Y2 O3  (3Y-TZP) is widely used because of its high flexural strength, biocompatibility, and aesthetics [5 ,6 ]. However, the modest fracture toughness (4–5 MPam1/2  for usual ∼330 nm grain size) and low-temperature degradation (LTD) of this material make it unsuitable for some special applications, such as materials in hydrothermal environments or materials for hip and knee prostheses [7–13 ]. By contrast, polycrystalline tetragonal zirconia stabilised by CeO2  (Ce-TZP) exhibits higher LTD resistance [14 ,15 ] and much higher fracture toughness (10–17 MPam1/2 ) [16 ]. However, Ce-TZP has a much lower bending strength (500–800 MPa) [16 ] compared to Y-TZP (1200–1500 MPa) [6 ]. Consequently, it is advantageous to combine the merits of both Y-TZP and Ce-TZP by stabilising tetragonal ZrO2  with Y2 O3  and CeO2 . Polycrystalline tetragonal zirconia (Y–Ce-TZP) stabilised by both yttria and ceria was found to possess sufficient LTD resistance [17 ] and adequate mechanical properties (fracture toughness of 13–15 MPam1/2  [18 ] and bending strength of 750–900 MPa [19 ]). It is well known that the mechanical properties of sintered ceramics are highly dependent on the initial powder properties, and low-agglomerated, quasi-spherical, homogenous, and fine nanoparticles (NPs) are conducive to obtaining sintered ceramics with excellent mechanical properties. Several methods such as suspension coating [18 ], hydrolysis [19 ], co-precipitation [20 ], and sol-gel [21 ] have been studied for the synthesis of Y–Ce–ZrO2  NPs. Among these, the sol-gel method is favoured because it can ensure a high degree of chemical homogeneity and purity, as well as very fine particle size [22–24 ]. The metal alkoxide sol-gel route has been widely investigated. However, expensive raw materials, such as the most commonly used zirconium propoxide, make the route costly for the industrial production of ZrO2  NPs [22 ,25–27 ]. The citric-acid-based sol-gel process, however, allows the use of much cheaper ZrOCl2 ·8H2 O (the cost is approximately one-fifth that of zirconium propoxide) as the zirconium source, making it more economical for industrial production [21 ]. Currently, morphology control, including alleviating agglomeration, refining grain size, and generating quasi-spherical morphology, is the biggest challenge for the citric acid-based sol-gel process. Although some researchers have attempted to control morphology by adjusting the pH value, which indeed works to some extent to alleviate agglomeration, the pH controlling process makes it less operation-friendly [21 ,28 ]. Freeze-drying [29 ] and ultrasonic treatment [30 ] were also investigated to avoid agglomeration, but the additional treatment makes them less attractive. Previously, we reported a novel sol-gel-flux method (SGFM) to fabricate 12Ce–ZrO2  NPs, and the NPs products showed well-dispersed, homogenous, and quasi-spherical morphology and had good sinterability. Briefly, stoichiometric ZrOCl2 ·8H2 O, Ce(NO3 )3 ·6H2 O, C6 H8 O7 ·H2 O (citric acid), and NaOH were dissolved in deionised water and heated at 80 °C to form a wet gel, followed by heating at 130 °C to form a xerogel. After calcining the xerogel at 800 °C and NaCl removal, fully tetragonal ZrO2  NPs were obtained. The steric hindrance of NaCl during the formation of the gel, calcination of the xerogel, and cooling of the ZrO2  NPs successfully alleviated the particle agglomeration. The novel SGFM requires no precise control of the pH value or additional treatment, such as freeze-drying or ultrasonic treatment, which makes the entire synthesis process more operation-friendly. In addition, our previous research revealed an important rule for the synthesis of preferable ZrO2  NPs by SGFM, that is, the optimum calcination temperature should be equal to or slightly higher than the melting point of the salt (NaCl). When the calcination temperature is lower than the melting point, the precursor cannot be fully oxidised, and agglomerated particles are obtained. When the xerogel is calcined at a temperature much higher than the melting temperature, significantly coarse and inhomogeneous particles are produced. Therefore, to synthesise well-dispersed and homogenous ZrO2  NPs and further refine the grain size by SGFM, the melting point of the salt system must be reduced. It is well established that the eutectic point of a binary salt system is generally lower than the melting point of a single salt. Therefore, a salt system with a lower melting point can be obtained by replacing NaCl with the NaCl + KCl binary system. In this study, well-dispersed ZrO2  NPs stabilised by Y2 O3  and CeO2  using SGFM in a NaCl system, as well as in the NaCl + KCl binary system, were synthesised, and the sintering performances of the products obtained in both systems were evaluated.  2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs 2.1.1 Materials Analytical grade reagents, including ZrOCl2 ·8H2 O, Y(NO3 )3 ·6H2 O, Ce(NO3 )3 ·6H2 O, C6 H8 O7 ·H2 O (citric acid), NaOH, and KOH, were purchased from Sinopharm (China).  2.1.2 Preparation method 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs were prepared by the SGFM method in the NaCl + KCl system. Solution A was prepared by dissolving ZrOCl2 ·8H2 O, Y(NO3 )3 ·6H2 O, Ce(NO3 )3 ·6H2 O, and C6 H8 O7 ·H2 O in deionised water. Solution B was prepared by dissolving NaOH and KOH (n(NaOH):n(KOH) = 1:1) in deionised water. The as-prepared solution B was slowly added dropwise to solution A under magnetic stirring. The molar ratio of n(Zr4+ ):n(Ce3+ ):n(Y3+ ) = 0.93:0.06:0.01 was chosen to obtain 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs stabilised by 1 mol% Y2 O3  and 6 mol% CeO2 . The molar ratio of the complexing agent (C6 H8 O7 ·H2 O) to metallic cations (n(C6 H8 O7 ·H2 O):[n(Zr4+ ) + n(Y3+ ) + n(Ce3+ )]) was 1.2:1. To transform all the Cl−  ions in the solution into NaCl and KCl, the molar ratio of [n(NaOH) + n(KOH)]:n(Cl− ) = 1:1 was used. The solution mixture was heated at 80 °C under magnetic stirring until the solution became increasingly viscous, and a translucent precursor gel was obtained. The gel was further heated at 130 °C for 3 h in a drying oven to obtain the xerogel. The xerogel was calcined at 600, 700, and 800 °C for 2 h in an air atmosphere. To remove NaCl and KCl, the calcined powder was ultrasonically washed in deionised water for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 8000 rpm. For comparison, 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs were also prepared using SGFM in the NaCl system. Briefly, solution A was prepared as described previously, and solution B was prepared by dissolving NaOH in deionised water with n(NaOH):n(Cl− ) = 1:1. A precursor gel was obtained by heating the solution mixture at 80 °C, which was then heated at 130 °C to obtain the xerogel. The xerogel was calcined at 600, 700, and 800 °C for 2 h, followed by ultrasonic washing for 1 h to obtain 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs. The preparation conditions are listed in Table 1  .  2.1.3 Characterisation The calcination behaviours of the obtained xerogel samples were characterised by thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA, STA449F3, NETZSCH, Germany) from room temperature to 1200 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) patterns were obtained with the scanning speeds of 6°/min (2θ = 20–90°) and 0.5°/min (2θ = 27–33°) for phase composition analysis and primary grain size determination, respectively. The morphological analysis and elemental mapping of the obtained NPs were performed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Merlin Compact, Zeiss, Germany) coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry. A transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan) was used to observe the microstructures of the obtained NPs at higher magnifications. The specific surface areas of the NPs were determined using the standard Brunauer-Emmett-Teller technique (BET, IQ2, Quantachrome, USA).   2.2 Sintering performance of 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs The sintering performance of W1-800-2 and W2-700-1 were evaluated. Green bodies with a diameter of 10 mm and a height of 2 mm were prepared by uniaxial pressing at 4 MPa for 60 s, followed by cold isostatic pressing at 220 MPa for 90 s. Sintering was performed in an air atmosphere at temperatures ranging from 1250 to 1450 °C for 2 h. The bulk density of the ceramics was determined by the Archimedes method, and the average grain size was obtained by measuring the diameter of at least 300 particles using FE-SEM images. The phase compositions of the ceramics were determined using XRD. The relative density (D R  ) of the ceramics was calculated using the following equation:D R  = D B  D T       where D B  and D T  represent the bulk density and theoretical density of the ceramics, respectively. A D T  value of 6.17 g/cm3  was used to calculate the D R .   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Comparison of two different systems 3.1.1 TG/DTA analysis of the precursors The TG/DTA curves of X1 and X2 are shown in Fig. 1  . The calcination of both X1 and X2 can be roughly divided into two stages at approximately 650 °C, according to the weight loss in the TG curves. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the weight losses of X1 in the first and second stages were 46.55% and 23.24%, respectively. The weight loss in the first stage resulted from the oxidation and dehydration of citric acid and citrates. Three exothermic peaks and one endothermic peak were observed in the corresponding DTA curve for the first stage. The exothermic peak at 183 °C was assigned to the combustion of citric acid and citrates with the help of oxidising agents (nitrates), whereas those at 398 and 597 °C were attributed to the further oxidation of the residual citric acid and citrates [31 ]. The single endothermic peak at 214 °C resulted from the dehydration of the xerogel. In the second stage, weight loss was caused by the evaporation of NaCl. The endothermic peak at 800 °C was attributed to the melting of NaCl and its evaporation at higher temperatures, resulting in weight loss in the second stage. The endothermic peak at 1116 °C was attributed to the phase change of 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  because no weight loss was observed in the corresponding TG curve. For X2, the weight loss in both the first and second stages was almost the same as that for X1, and the number and temperature of the exothermic and endothermic peaks were similar to those for X1. However, a significant difference was observed in the DTA curves of the second stage, where the endothermic peak (Fig. 1 b) corresponding to the melting of the NaCl + KCl binary system was broader than the one in Fig. 1 a. As shown in Fig. 1 b, the melting of the NaCl + KCl binary system started at approximately 655 °C and peaked at 716 °C, which is significantly lower than 800 °C of the NaCl system in Fig. 1 a. The lower melting temperature of the NaCl + KCl binary system is revealed by the phase diagram in Fig. 2  , where the eutectic temperature is 658 °C. The lower melting temperature of the binary salt system is conducive to reducing the calcination temperature and refining the particle size of the NPs.  3.1.2 XRD analyses The xerogel precursors, X1 and X2, were calcined at 700 °C for 2 h, and the products were C1-700-2 and C2-700-2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3  , NaCl was identified in the XRD pattern of X1, and both NaCl and KCl were observed in the XRD pattern of X2. These results indicated that NaOH and KOH in solution B reacted with ZrOCl2 ·8H2 O in solution A to form NaCl and KCl. Except for the peaks belonging to NaCl and KCl, no peaks belonging to other compositions were observed in the XRD patterns, indicating the presence of amorphous complexes formed by the ligand (C6 H5 O7 )3−  and metallic cations Zr4+ , Y3+ , and Ce3+ . NaCl and tetragonal ZrO2  (t -ZrO2 ) were identified in the XRD pattern of C1-700-2, implying the stability of NaCl during the calcination of X1 and no reaction between NaCl and t -ZrO2 . In the XRD pattern of C2-700-2, except for the peaks belonging to t -ZrO2 , peaks corresponding to NaCl and KCl were not observed. Instead, the new phases (Na0.9 K0.1 Cl and Na0.1 K0.9 Cl) were found in C2-700-2. As revealed by the TG/DTA results (Fig. 1 ) and the phase diagram of the NaCl + KCl binary system (Fig. 2 ), the calcination temperature (700 °C) is lower than the melting point of NaCl but higher than the eutectic temperature of the NaCl + KCl binary system. Therefore, the presence of Na0.9 K0.1 Cl and Na0.1 K0.9 Cl in C2-700-2 was caused by the melting and segregation of NaCl and KCl. Notably, despite melting and segregation, NaCl and KCl did not react with t -ZrO2  during calcination.  3.1.3 Elemental mapping The elemental mapping of C1-700-2 (Fig. 4  ) revealed the homogeneous distribution of Zr, O, Ce, and Y. Moreover, elemental Na and Cl were found to be homogeneously distributed in the areas of Zr, O, Ce, and Y, indicating that t-ZrO2  particles were homogeneously separated by NaCl particles. The rectangular particles of size ∼500 nm were identified as NaCl crystals according to the Na and Cl enrichment of this area. Fig. 5   shows the elemental mapping of C2-700-2, revealing the complementary distribution of Na and K, where a low Na distribution was observed in the high K area and vice versa. This phenomenon confirmed the formation of Na0.9 K0.1 Cl and Na0.1 K0.9 Cl due to the segregation of NaCl and KCl during the cooling of the molten salt. Analysing the distribution of K, Na, and Cl in the areas of Zr, O, Ce, and Y, it can be speculated that the t -ZrO2  particles were homogeneously separated by the Na0.9 K0.1 Cl and Na0.1 K0.9 Cl particles.   3.2 Influence of calcination temperature 3.2.1 Phase composition As shown in Fig. 6  , the 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  products obtained at 600 and 700 °C were identified to be t -ZrO2 , regardless of the salt system (NaCl or NaCl + KCl). At 800 °C, diffraction peaks indexed to m -ZrO2  were observed. However, their low intensity indicated a low concentration of m -ZrO2  in the products. These results indicated that when the SGFM is involved, the phase composition of the NPs depends on the calcination temperature rather than the salt system. It is speculated that the particle size of the NPs grows at high temperatures, and a small fraction of the NPs may grow abnormally. Consequently, the size of the abnormally grown NPs could exceed the critical size for the transformation of t -ZrO2  into m -ZrO2 , leading to the formation of a monoclinic phase in the NPs.  3.2.2 Particle size and BET surface area The primary grain sizes and BET surface areas of the 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs prepared at different temperatures are listed in Table 2  . The primary grain sizes were calculated using the Debye-Scherrer equation (d = Kλ/bcosθ) [33 ]. As shown in Table 2 , the grain sizes of both W1 and W2 increased significantly with increasing temperature, whereas the BET surface areas decreased significantly. The grain sizes of the samples prepared at 800 °C were roughly twice that of the samples prepared at 600 °C. Therefore, if homogeneity and dispersibility of the product are assured, a lower temperature would be beneficial for synthesising finer NPs. Notably, the W2 samples had finer primary grain size and higher surface area compared to W1 samples synthesised at the same temperature, indicating the advantages of the NaCl + KCl system.  3.2.3 Morphology Fig. 7   shows pictures and FE-SEM images of 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs prepared at different temperatures. As shown in Fig. 7 a, both the W1 and W2 samples at 600 °C were grey, indicating the presence of residual carbon generated from the decomposition of the citric acid or citrates. At 800 °C, both W1 and W2 samples were light yellow due to the complete oxidation of the precursor. The difference between the NaCl and NaCl + KCl systems was observed at 700 °C, where W1-700-2 was grey, and W2-700-2 was light yellow. That is because NaCl remains in a solid state at 700 °C, whereas the NaCl + KCl binary system melts at this temperature. The oxidation of precursor is handicapped by the solid NaCl, whereas the molten salt of NaCl + KCl is conducive to the oxidation of the precursor due to the more convenient mass transfer of O2  and CO2 . FE-SEM images revealed agglomerated particles at 600 °C (Fig. 7 b and e ). By contrast, no significant hard agglomeration was observed at 800 °C (Fig. 7 d and g ). Therefore, it was concluded that the melted salt is conducive to obtaining well-dispersed nanoparticles because both NaCl and NaCl + KCl systems melt at 800 °C. This conclusion is further supported by the FE-SEM images of samples synthesised at 700 °C, where W1-700-2 prepared in solid NaCl exhibited hard agglomeration of nanoparticles (Fig. 7 c) and W2-700-2 prepared in molten NaCl + KCl exhibited no hard agglomeration (Fig. 7 f). It was deduced that some precursor particles were not separated by the salt particles. The solid salt (NaCl) could hardly move into the gaps between the particles. Therefore, the precursor particles close to each other could agglomerate during calcination. By contrast, the molten salt (NaCl + KCl) could easily fill the gaps between the precursor particles because of the capillary effect. Thus, the particles were separated by the binary salt, and well-dispersed ZrO2  NPs were obtained after the salt removal by washing. The above analysis shows that hard agglomeration and removal of residual carbon could only be achieved in the melted salt system. As the melting temperatures of NaCl and the NaCl + KCl binary system are 800 °C and <700 °C, respectively, the ZrO2  NPs without significant hard agglomeration and residual carbon could only be obtained above 800 °C in the NaCl system and at 700 °C in the NaCl + KCl system. In Table 2 , the primary grain sizes of W1-800-2 and W2-700-2 are 23.8 nm and 15.7 nm, and the BET surface areas are 28.05 m2 /g and 52.27 m2 /g, respectively. Thus, a lower temperature is beneficial for the synthesis of finer and segregated nanoparticles.   3.3 Influence of holding time Three types of 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs were prepared by heating at 700 °C for 1, 2, and 3 h in a NaCl + KCl system. As shown in Fig. 8  a, all three products were light yellow, indicating the complete oxidation of the precursor. In addition, no hard agglomeration was observed in the FE-SEM images of W2-700-1, W2-700-2, and W2-700-3 (Fig. 8 b–d). Therefore, it was surmised that 1 h at 700 °C is sufficient to transform the precursor prepared in the NaCl + KCl system into the 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  product without hard agglomeration and residual carbon. The primary grain sizes of the three 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs were calculated using the Debye-Scherrer equation (d = Kλ/bcosθ), and the results are listed in Table 3  . As the holding time decreased from 3 to 1 h, the primary grain size decreased from 16.3 to 14.5 nm, and the corresponding BET surface area increased from 49.99 to 55.06 m2 /g. Fig. 9   shows TEM images of W1-800-2 and W2-700-1 with well-dispersed NPs. However, the grain size of W2-700-1 was significantly smaller than W1-800-2. In addition, broad particles size distribution and rod-like particles were observed in W1-800-2 (Fig. 9 a), whereas W2-700-1 was composed of quasi-spherical particles with a much narrower particles size distribution (Fig. 9 b). Therefore, W2-700-1 was considered a much better material for synthesising 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  ceramics.  3.4 Sintering performances of 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs The as-prepared W1-800-2 and W2-700-1 samples were sintered in the temperature range of 1250–1450 °C. As shown in Fig. 10  a, the relative density of both ceramics increased with increasing temperature up to 1400 °C. As the temperature further increased to 1450 °C, the relative density of W2-700-1 continued to increase, whereas that of W1-800-2 decreased significantly from 99.54 to 97.12%. The decrease in the density of W1-800-2 was attributed to the presence of the monoclinic phase at 1450 °C (Fig. 10 c and d ). However, only the tetragonal phase was observed in the W2-700-1 ceramic (Fig. 10 c and d ). These results imply that W2-700-1 is more stable at higher sintering temperatures. The higher stability of W2-700-1 could be attributed to its smaller particle size, which resulted in a smaller average grain size of W2-700-1 ceramic than W1-800-2 ceramic, as depicted in Fig. 10 b. It is less likely for the smaller grain size of the W2-700-1 ceramic to exceed the critical grain size for the transformation of t -ZrO2  into m -ZrO2 . However, the larger grain size of W1-800-2 ceramic indicated that certain amounts of grains could exceed the critical grain size, which explains the presence of monoclinic ZrO2  in a considerable amount. As shown in Fig. 10 a, both W1-800-2 and W2-700-1 ceramics reached full density (relative density >98%) at 1400 °C. The FE-SEM images and grain size distributions of both ceramics prepared at 1400 °C are presented in Fig. 11  . Although no significant difference could be directly observed in the FE-SEM images (Fig. 11 a and b ), the average grain size of the W2-700-1 ceramic was smaller than that of the W1-800-2 ceramic. In addition, the grain size distribution of W2-700-1 ceramic was narrower, and the relative frequency of fine grains (0.2–0.8 μm) was higher than W1-800-2 ceramic, as shown in Fig. 11 c and d . In summary, 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  ceramic prepared from W2-700-1 nanoparticles exhibited higher stability at high temperatures, finer grain size, and narrower grain size distributions, which are conducive to improving their mechanical properties.   4 Conclusion 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs were synthesised using SGFM, and both NaCl and NaCl + KCl systems were investigated. The results show that residual carbon and hard agglomeration can be eliminated at a lower temperature (700 °C) for the NaCl + KCl system compared to the NaCl system (800 °C). Owing to the lower calcination temperature, the fully tetragonal 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs (W2-700-1) synthesised in the NaCl + KCl system exhibited a finer grain size (approximately 14.5 nm), narrower grain size distribution, and quasi-spherical morphology. 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs (W2-700-1, prepared in the NaCl + KCl system at 700 °C for 1 h) also exhibited better sintering performance than 1Y6Ce–ZrO2  NPs (W1-800-2, prepared in the NaCl system at 800 °C for 2 h).

Abstract:
Thin TiSiN flat films deposited by MOCVD have been analysed in order to evaluate their microstructure and physical properties. TEM, XRR and RBS techniques have been utilised as complementary analyses to evaluate thickness, density and composition. The main composition is

The silane soak produces a low concentration silicon inclusion, mainly stabilising the grain boundaries and not affecting the TiN crystalline morphology. AES profiles show that the TiSiN film consists of Ti–N rich layers, separated by C and Si rich “interface” layers which are the result of the process sequence. Densification and crystallisation of the film were observed after high temperature annealing in vacuum, resulting in an electrical resistivity decrease. PECVD deposition of an oxide layer on TiSiN causes a strong oxidation and resistivity increase of the film.

Introduction:
TiSiN is a composite material developed during the early 1980s [1]. The main studies have been focused on its enhanced hardness and refractory properties produced by the nanocomposite microstructure of TiN nanocrystals embedded in an amorphous

                      matrix. The application interest was as hard coating layer for wear protection. More recently TiSiN has been considered to be used in IC technology, mainly as diffusion barrier [2]. Silicon content affects the physical properties of the film like electrical resistivity [2,3], oxidation stability [4–6] and diffusion barrier efficiency [7,8]. TiSiN is a refractory material candidate to be used in phase change memory as contact electrode to the calchogenide material, owing to its high temperature stability. For this application, the severe thermal operation conditions can set a big constrain on the material selection.

Experimental:
The TiSiN deposition process utilised in this study consists of TiN deposition by MOCVD (metal-organic chemical vapour deposition) followed by an annealing at

                      to remove the organic residue and to promote film densification. TiN layer must be sufficiently thin to ensure plasma efficiency, Si diffusion and reaction inside the whole film during the soak and to produce a more homogenous composition. Thicker films can be obtained by multiple TiSiN layer deposition.

TEM, XRR, and RBS techniques have been utilised as complementary analyses to evaluate thickness, density and composition: the thickness values from TEM are the references for XRR data fitting, the refined thickness and electron density values from XRR are used as crossing checking point for RBS results on elemental composition.

Results and discussion:
Owing to the multistep process a multilayered structure is expected. TEM cross section analysis shows a layered structure with higher density layers alternated to less dense ones (Fig. 1
                     ). The higher density layer consists of nanocrystals smaller than 5nm along the film thickness (darker regions in Fig. 1) embedded in an amorphous matrix, “confined” into each TiSiN single layer. The results are consistent with literature data of multilayer TiSiN films deposited by a CVD process similar to what used in this study [10]. The thickness of the layers is uniform, apart that of the first layer which has been grown on a different substrate (amorphous

                      plasma removes a large portion of the organic residue but is only effective to a depth of 3–5nm, leaving more carbon in the bottom of each TiN layer; silane is more effective on the exposed surface. The combination of this two process steps (relative to different TiSiN layer deposition cycles) produces a higher concentration of Si and C at each interface between “single” TiSiN layers.

                      TiSiN films the correlation between RBS spectra modelling and XRR data has been made between atomic density and electron density averaged along the whole TiSiN film thickness.
Using the measured TiSiN total thickness (from TEM and/or XRR) as input constant, the variables for RBS spectra modelling are the elemental composition and the atomic density. The correct elemental composition is extracted by the best data fitting which utilises as atomic density the value calculated by the electron density and the composition itself by

Conclusions:
Thin TiSiN flat films deposited by CVD have been analysed in order to evaluate their microstructure and physical properties. TEM, XRR and RBS techniques have been utilised as complementary analyses to evaluate thickness, density and composition.

The analysis shows a layered structure which well correlates with deposition steps. TiN nanocrystals embedded in an amorphous matrix result confined into each TiSiN deposited layer. The interfaces between adjacent layers have lower density, consistent with Si- and C-rich regions.
Titanium and silicon are mainly bonded to nitrogen, as shown by XPS. Si solubility in TiN should be very low because of different ionic radius and chemical nature of Ti

The majority of the studies on “mictamic” (mixing of immiscible) materials was made by co-sputtering deposition of transition elements in nitriding or oxidising atmosphere, so that both compounds are formed at the same time improving an intimate mixing. This is not the case for TiSiN MOCVD process, where silicon inclusion is completed after TiN deposition. Silane soak is not able to break Ti–N bound: as a result silicon content is less than 10at% and the film is not amorphous.
An important issue for applications is to preserve stable TiSiN electrical property. The microstructure and the degree of oxidation are key parameters to control it [13,14]. Densification and crystallisation of the TiSiN films were observed for short thermal treatments at temperatures higher than

TiSiN is a composite material developed during the early 1980s [1]. The main studies have been focused on its enhanced hardness and refractory properties produced by the nanocomposite microstructure of TiN nanocrystals embedded in an amorphous

                      matrix. The application interest was as hard coating layer for wear protection. More recently TiSiN has been considered to be used in IC technology, mainly as diffusion barrier [2]. Silicon content affects the physical properties of the film like electrical resistivity [2,3], oxidation stability [4–6] and diffusion barrier efficiency [7,8]. TiSiN is a refractory material candidate to be used in phase change memory as contact electrode to the calchogenide material, owing to its high temperature stability. For this application, the severe thermal operation conditions can set a big constrain on the material selection.

The TiSiN deposition process utilised in this study consists of TiN deposition by MOCVD (metal-organic chemical vapour deposition) followed by an annealing at

TiN layer must be sufficiently thin to ensure plasma efficiency, Si diffusion and reaction inside the whole film during the soak and to produce a more homogenous composition. Thicker films can be obtained by multiple TiSiN layer deposition.

TEM, XRR, and RBS techniques have been utilised as complementary analyses to evaluate thickness, density and composition: the thickness values from TEM are the references for XRR data fitting, the refined thickness and electron density values from XRR are used as crossing checking point for RBS results on elemental composition.

Owing to the multistep process a multilayered structure is expected. TEM cross section analysis shows a layered structure with higher density layers alternated to less dense ones (Fig. 1
                     ). The higher density layer consists of nanocrystals smaller than 5nm along the film thickness (darker regions in Fig. 1) embedded in an amorphous matrix, “confined” into each TiSiN single layer. The results are consistent with literature data of multilayer TiSiN films deposited by a CVD process similar to what used in this study [10]. The thickness of the layers is uniform, apart that of the first layer which has been grown on a different substrate (amorphous

The combination of this two process steps (relative to different TiSiN layer deposition cycles) produces a higher concentration of Si and C at each interface between “single” TiSiN layers.

Using the measured TiSiN total thickness (from TEM and/or XRR) as input constant, the variables for RBS spectra modelling are the elemental composition and the atomic density. The correct elemental composition is extracted by the best data fitting which utilises as atomic density the value calculated by the electron density and the composition itself by

                         produces a strong increase of the electrical resistivity up to about

Thin TiSiN flat films deposited by CVD have been analysed in order to evaluate their microstructure and physical properties. TEM, XRR and RBS techniques have been utilised as complementary analyses to evaluate thickness, density and composition.

                      with carbon and oxygen up to 5% as a result of organic residuals and oxidation.

The analysis shows a layered structure which well correlates with deposition steps. TiN nanocrystals embedded in an amorphous matrix result confined into each TiSiN deposited layer. The interfaces between adjacent layers have lower density, consistent with Si- and C-rich regions.

Titanium and silicon are mainly bonded to nitrogen, as shown by XPS. Si solubility in TiN should be very low because of different ionic radius and chemical nature of Ti

The majority of the studies on “mictamic” (mixing of immiscible) materials was made by co-sputtering deposition of transition elements in nitriding or oxidising atmosphere, so that both compounds are formed at the same time improving an intimate mixing. This is not the case for TiSiN MOCVD process, where silicon inclusion is completed after TiN deposition. Silane soak is not able to break Ti–N bound: as a result silicon content is less than 10at% and the film is not amorphous.

An important issue for applications is to preserve stable TiSiN electrical property. The microstructure and the degree of oxidation are key parameters to control it [13,14]. Densification and crystallisation of the TiSiN films were observed for short thermal treatments at temperatures higher than

Introduction:
The temperature dependent volume and thermal expansivity data of any kind of materials i.e. ionic crystal, earth's interior material, etc. are required for developing the equation of state and predicting the temperature dependence of different parameter like volume, density, bulk modulus and thermal pressure, etc.
The studies based on the isobaric equation of state (EOS) are of wide importance in area of physics, geophysics and studying the Earth's interior [1–4]. The EOS are applicable to extrapolate and interpolate the data of different parameters and helpful to plan the different kind of experiments in the area of high temperature and high pressure.
The volume thermal expansion is an anharmonic effect [2]. Some of the experimental values of volume thermal expansion α(T) at high temperature have considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty is responsible for error in the calculation of thermodynamical parameter [5,6]. Various efforts [7–16] have been made to develop semi-phenomenological models or EOS for predicting the values of different thermodynamical quantities with the help of thermodynamical relation, assumption and experimental facts.
In the present communication, EOS has been developed on the basis of the fact that the volume thermal expansion is an anharmonic effect that is considered as the coefficient of volume thermal expansion α(T) is quadratic function of temperature (T). The expression for ρ(T) density has been developed and tested for NaCl ionic crystal [16]. In the present paper, we have extended the use of this equation of state for calculation of different thermodynamical parameter and thermal-pressure as function of temperature (T) of mantle materials, i.e. X2SiO4 (X=Mg, Fe, Co, Mn).
The method of analysis is provided in Section 2 while the results are discussed and compared with experimental data [17,18] in Section 3.

                     th (T) as function of temperature (T) are alculated by using above derived equations, To find these parameters, we need the value of C
                     1 which is estimated by Eq. (4) for different mantle minerals X2SiO4 (X=Mg, Fe, Co, Mn). The computed values of the parameter C

                      along with experimental values with respect to X2SiO4 (X=Mg, Fe, Co and Mn). A good agreement is found in calculated and experimental values of ρ(T), α(T), K(T), G(T) and ΔP
                     th(T) at different temperature for each of minerals [16,17].
The good agreements of calculated and experimental values of α(T), K(T), G(T) and ΔP
                     th(T) support the validity of the assumption used to develop the EOS and other expressions. This semi phenomenological EOS developed on assumption tested for NaCl crystal is applicable for other minerals and materials.
To summarize, the present study highlights and provides a new and simpler method to study temperature ariation of different-thermodynamical parameters for complex solids such as minerals, i.e. X2SiO4(X=Mg, Fe, Co, Mn). So, the developed semi-phenomenological EOS are useful to thermodynamical quantities of various class of solid present in earth mantles.

Body:
The temperature dependent volume and thermal expansivity data of any kind of materials i.e. ionic crystal, earth's interior material, etc. are required for developing the equation of state and predicting the temperature dependence of different parameter like volume, density, bulk modulus and thermal pressure, etc.

The studies based on the isobaric equation of state (EOS) are of wide importance in area of physics, geophysics and studying the Earth's interior [1–4]. The EOS are applicable to extrapolate and interpolate the data of different parameters and helpful to plan the different kind of experiments in the area of high temperature and high pressure.

The volume thermal expansion is an anharmonic effect [2]. Some of the experimental values of volume thermal expansion α(T) at high temperature have considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty is responsible for error in the calculation of thermodynamical parameter [5,6]. Various efforts [7–16] have been made to develop semi-phenomenological models or EOS for predicting the values of different thermodynamical quantities with the help of thermodynamical relation, assumption and experimental facts.

In the present communication, EOS has been developed on the basis of the fact that the volume thermal expansion is an anharmonic effect that is considered as the coefficient of volume thermal expansion α(T) is quadratic function of temperature (T). The expression for ρ(T) density has been developed and tested for NaCl ionic crystal [16]. In the present paper, we have extended the use of this equation of state for calculation of different thermodynamical parameter and thermal-pressure as function of temperature (T) of mantle materials, i.e. X2SiO4 (X=Mg, Fe, Co, Mn).

The method of analysis is provided in Section 2 while the results are discussed and compared with experimental data [17,18] in Section 3.

                     th(T) at different temperature for each of minerals [16,17].

The good agreements of calculated and experimental values of α(T), K(T), G(T) and ΔP
                     th(T) support the validity of the assumption used to develop the EOS and other expressions. This semi phenomenological EOS developed on assumption tested for NaCl crystal is applicable for other minerals and materials.

To summarize, the present study highlights and provides a new and simpler method to study temperature ariation of different-thermodynamical parameters for complex solids such as minerals, i.e. X2SiO4(X=Mg, Fe, Co, Mn). So, the developed semi-phenomenological EOS are useful to thermodynamical quantities of various class of solid present in earth mantles.

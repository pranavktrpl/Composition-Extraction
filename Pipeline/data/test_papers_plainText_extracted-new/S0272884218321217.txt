Title:
Ultra-stable X9R type CaCu

Abstract:
CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 (x = 0.00, 0.05 and 0.10) precursor powders were prepared by the polymer pyrolysis (PP) solution method. Ultra-stable X9R type capacitor with very low loss tangent (tanδ) ~0.017 varied within a value of less than 0.05 in a wide temperature range of −60 to 150 °C and high dielectric constants (ε
                     ′) ~9200 with Δε′ ≤ ± 15% in a wide temperature range of −60 to 210 °C was achieved in CaCu2.95Zn0.05Ti4.1O12 (Zn05-1) ceramic obtained by sintering the precursor powder (x = 0.05) at 1060 °C for 8 h. A major role for the validity of ε
                     ′ and tanδ in these wider temperature ranges was suggested to originated from the very high grain boundary resistance (R

                      ~413,190 Ω cm), resulting from the effect of Zn2+ doping and TiO2-rich at grain boundary. With the excellent dielectric properties of (Zn05-1) ceramic, it was suggested to be applied for X8R and X9R capacitors. Interestingly, improvements of nonlinear properties with very high nonlinear coefficient (α ~ 25.94) and breakdown field (E

Introduction:
So far, investigation on the improvement of dielectric and electrical properties with the temperature stability of dielectric constant (Δε

                     30 °C) of the CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) [1–9] and related compounds [10–12] have been continuously studied and become even more attractive issue for researchers. Although these dielectric materials have been extensively investigated, however it was infrequently successful to achieve all requirements of very high dielectric performance in a wide temperature and frequency range, especially for the X8R and X9R capacitors. In general, the EIA code X8R and X9R capacitors are operated at a temperature higher than 125 °C without external cooling, which is a requirement for aerospace, military mobile communications and energy production industries [13]. In addition, it is specific that the condition of Δε
                     ′ to satisfy for X8R and X9R capacitors should be less than ±15% in a temperature range of −55 to 150 °C and −55 to 200 °C, respectively. Accordingly, investigation for X8R capacitors has been extensively studied and there are only a few articles that reported for CCTO-based compound [2,14,15]. However, there are no reports for X9R capacitor based on CCTO ceramic materials. Generally, X9R capacitors have been intensively studied and reported in ferroelectric perovskite compounds [13,16], normally sintered at high temperature, which is a disadvantage of the preparation process due to high energy consumption and might probably cause a seriously environmental problem. In order to improve the dielectric and electrical properties with a novel satisfy condition for Δε 
                     ′ of CCTO-based compound to meet the X8R and X9R capacitors, many approaches have been proposed for the preparation of the materials such as (1) doping and co-doping with various metals in CCTO ceramics to improve the electrical properties of grain boundaries (GBs) [2,17–19], (2) doping with some metals in CCTO/CaTiO3 composites [15,20], (3) using appropriate sintering conditions to enhance GB layers [21–23] and (4) increasing the Ti molar concentration in CCTO compound to produce TiO2-rich CCTO ceramics [24–27], Among these approaches, (1), (2) and (3) are the most ones that have been intensively reported [15,17–19,28,29] with a few of them that can successfully achieve for X8R capacitors such as the studies on Mg2+ doped CCTO/CaTiO3 
                     [15], La3+ doped CCTO [8] and Zn-doping CCTO [2]. Furthermore, the study by approach (4) reported only the dielectric properties at room temperature without the study of Δε 
                     ′. For instance, Lin and coworkers [25] reported the effect of TiO2-rich in the microstructure and dielectric properties of CCTO (CaCu3Ti4+xO12; x = 0.00–1.5) ceramics prepared by solid state reaction method. They found that TiO2 impurity phase trended to increase with increasing Ti content, resulting in the decrease of ε 
                     ′ and tanδ values to ~4233 and ~0.03, respectively. In addition to this, the nonlinear J–E properties could be improved as well. Ouyang and coworkers [24] reported the dielectric properties (ε 
                     ′ ~5.5 ×104 and tanδ ~0.2) of TiO2-rich CCTO ceramics derived by a sol gel method. Hao and coworkers [30] reported the preparation of CCTO/xTiO2 (x = 0.0–2.0) ceramics by using a sol gel technique and found that the tanδ and ε 
                     ′ values decreased with increasing Ti content, due to the presence of TiO2 secondary phase. Other than this, it was also found that the CCTO/TiO2 composite ceramics had an advantage over the ferroelectric perovskite materials, because it could be prepared by a one-step process from a nominal CaCu3Ti4+xO12 composition [24,25] with sintering temperature lower than that of ferroelectric perovskite compounds. Consequently, it will be superior that the dielectric properties, nonlinear characteristics and Δε 
                     ′ of the CCTO/TiO2 ceramics can be concurrently improved with a novel innovation that might support the capacitors technology. Recently, it was also found that Zn2+ doping in CCTO-based ceramics [2,31–34] and co-doping with others metal [19,35] could improve not only the electrical properties, but also simultaneously enhance the Δε 
                     ′. For instance, high performance dielectric properties with the satisfy Δε 
                     ′ for X8R capacitor could be achieved in the Zn2+ ions doped CaCu2Ti4O12 ceramics [2]. According to this report and literature, it is supposed that Zn2+-doped CaCu2Ti4O12/TiO2 ceramics could simultaneously improve the dielectric properties with the satisfy Δε 
                     ′ for the X8R and X9R capacitors.
In this work, CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 (x = 0.00, 0.05 and 0.10) precursor powders were prepared by the polymer pyrolysis (PP) solution method [9,20]. Effect of Zn2+ doping on the dielectric properties, nonlinear (J–E curve) characteristics and Δε 
                     ′ of all ceramic samples prepared from these precursor powders were studied and discussed based on the promotion of oxygen vacancy at grain boundary (GB). Interestingly, excellent dielectric properties (ε 
                     ′ ~9200 and tanδ ~0.017) with a wide valid temperature range (ΔT) of −60 to 210 °C for Δε′ ≤ ± 15% and −60 to 150 °C for tanδ ≤ 0.05 were achieved. Moreover, the highest value of α (~49.66) and E
                     
                        b
                      (~13146.25 V.cm−1) were obtained in this study. In order to elucidate the effect of Zn2+ ions on the dielectric properties and nonlinear characteristics of all prepared ceramic samples, impedance spectroscopy were performed.

Experimental:
CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 (x = 0.00, 0.05 and 0.10, abbreviated as Ti01, Zn05 and Zn10, respectively) powders were prepared by the PP method. Acrylic acid (CH2 =CHCOOH, Sigma Aldrich), Ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O4), Calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O), Zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), Copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) and Titanium solution (C16H28O6Ti 75 wt% in isopropanol) were employed as starting materials. The complete details of the PP method were described in our previous work [9]. The pellets of Ti01, Zn05 and Zn10 samples with approximate thickness of 1 mm and diameter of 9 mm were prepared by using the uniaxial compression at ~50 MPa. These pellet samples were sintered in air at two different sintering conditions of 1060 °C for 8 h (abbreviated as Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics) and 1100 °C for 5 h (abbreviated as Ti01-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics).
Microstructure and elemental mapping of ceramic samples were explored by scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6510LV, Oxford Instrument) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDXS). Standard line intercept technique was used to calculate the average grain sizes (AGs) of ceramic samples. Phase compositions were investigated by X-ray diffraction (Bruker/D8 Advance; Bruker BioSpin AG; λ = 0.15406 nm). Prior to measurements of dielectric properties and nonlinear J–E curves, all ceramic pellets were polished and cleaned on both sides to obtain the smooth surfaces. Subsequently, both surfaces were coated with Au using a sputtering unit (Polaron SC500). Dielectric properties were measured in a wide temperature (−60 to 210 °C) and frequency (100 Hz to 1 MHz) ranges using an impedance gain phase analyzer (Hewlett Packard 4194A). Nonlinear J–E curves were examined at 30 °C using a high voltage measurement unit (Keithley Model 247). Two important values of nonlinear characteristics i.e. breakdown electric field (E
                     
                        b
                     ) and nonlinear coefficient (α) were determined by a method described in our previous work [21,36]. The oxidation state of Ti ion in ceramic samples were verified using X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, Multiple X-ray, Energy 4–18 keV, Current 100 mA, 107–1010 photon s−1). The percentage of Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio in all ceramic samples was calculated using equation provided in our previous work [36]. The complete details of XANES technique and data analysis were described elsewhere [37,38].

Results and discussion:
Fig. 1(a)–(f) display the Rietveld refinement profile fits (RRPFs) [39] of the XRD patterns of all ceramic samples, which can be identified to correspond with the standard data for CaCu3Ti4O12 (ICSD card No.95714), having the body center cubic (bcc) structure. As expected, a minor peak of TiO2 phase (ICSD card No. 26715) is observed in the XRD patterns of all Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics with no detection of ZnO impurity phase due to the insensitivity of the XRD technique to any phase of concentration less than 0.5 wt% [40,41]. According to the RRPFs, the CaCu3Ti4O12:TiO2 ratios of Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1, T101-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics were determined and found to be 100.0:0.0, 97.9:2.1, 94.9:5.1, 100.0:0.0, 97.0:3.0, 95.7:4.3, respectively. It is notable that the TiO2 fraction significantly increases with increasing Zn2+ doping content. According to the RRPFs, lattice parameters (a), theoretical densities (D
                     
                        xrd
                     ), GOF and the quality of the refinement of all ceramic samples are determined and all of the results are listed in 
                     Table 1. The RRPFs of high quality for all ceramic samples are confirmed by the low values of goodness of fit (GOF) in a range of ~1.2–1.5 and those of the residual (R
                     p, R
                     exp and R
                     wp) values in a range of ~7‒11%, where R
                     p is the profile residual, R
                     exp is the expected residual and R
                     wp is the weighted profile residual, as seen in Table 1. In addition, the lattice parameter a values of all ceramic samples reveal no significant change with the increase of Zn2+ content due to the slightly different ionic radius of Cu2+ (0.87 Å) and Zn2+ (0.88 Å). Moreover, all lattice parameters (a) are comparable with that of the CCTO ceramics (a = 7.391 Å) reported in literature [21,42]. Additionally, the theoretical densities (D
                     
                        xrd
                     ) of undoped-CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics are lower than those of the Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics due to the replacement of a lighter Cu atom (63.546 amu) by a heavier Zn atom (65.380 amu).
Generally, dielectric and nonlinear characteristic of CCTO-based ceramics are significantly dependent on their microstructure [21,43]. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the microstructure evolutions of these CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 ceramics. 
                     Fig. 2(a)–(c) and (d)–(f) are SEM images of polished surface-ceramic samples sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h and 1100 °C for 5 h, respectively. The average grain sizes (AGs) of these samples were determined and summarized in Table 1. Obviously seen in Table 1 that, the AGs of all ceramic samples decrease with increasing Zn2+ doping content due to the solute drag mechanism [36,44] originate from the slight difference in ionic radii of Zn2+ (0.86 Å) dopant and Cu2+ (0.87 Å) host ions, including the existence of TiO2 phase. Furthermore, AGs of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics significantly increase with the sintering temperature, as obviously seen in Table 1. This behavior is similar to those observed in the microstructure of CCTO-based ceramics [21,23].
The frequency dependence of ε
                     ′ and tanδ for Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are shown in 
                     Fig. 3(a) and inset (1) of Fig. 3(a), respectively. In Fig. 3(a), ε
                     ′ values (at 30 °C and 1 kHz) of Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1 ceramics are found to be 130,566, 9200 and 4985, respectively. It is notable that ε
                     ′ value of Ti01-1 ceramic decreases with increasing Zn2+ content. Interestingly, ε
                     ′ values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are almost stable in the frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 MHz and further rapidly drop above 1 MHz, while that of Ti01-1 ceramic slightly decreases in the range of 100 Hz to 0.2 MHz and then rapidly drop above 0.2 MHz. The rapid drop of ε
                     ′ in these ceramic samples is attributed to the Maxwell-Wagner relaxation model. According to this model, the dielectric relaxation is governed by the difference of electrical response of the grain and grain boundaries (GBs), which cause charge accumulation at the GBs [45,46]. In addition, it is found that ε
                     ′ values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are approximately 14 and 26 times lower than that of the Ti01-1 ceramic. Nevertheless, these values are still large and sufficient for commercial applications. In addition to a high ε
                     ′ value, tanδ value of a commercial dielectric material should be less than 0.05 [23]. As seen in the inset (1) of Fig. 3(a), at 30 °C and 1 kHz, tanδ values are found to be 0.09, 0.017 and 0.026 for Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1 ceramics, respectively. Surprisingly, it is found that tanδ values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are under the red dashed line (the red dashed line signifies tanδ = 0.05) in a wide frequency range of 100–30,000 Hz and 100–10,000 Hz, respectively. Meanwhile, tanδ value of Ti01-1 ceramic is above this red dashed line with value higher than 0.05 for the whole range of frequency. Inset (2) of Fig. 3(a) displays a nonlinear J–E characteristic of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics. At 30 °C, α and E

                      value of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics were determined and found to be (4.51, 25.94, 49.66) and (599.45, 13146.25, 6626.06 V.cm−1), respectively. It is obvious that the lowest tanδ value of 0.017 observed in the Zn05-1 ceramic is consistent with the highest E
                     
                        b
                      value. This might be due to the very high grain boundary resistance (R
                     
                        gb
                     ), resulting from the TiO2-rich and Zn2+-doping effect. All values of ε

                     Table 2.
Fig. 3(b) and its inset (1) display the frequency dependence of ε
                     ′ and tanδ of Ti01–2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics. At 30 °C and 1 kHz, ε
                     ′ and tanδ value of Ti01–2, Zn05-2, Zn10-2 ceramics were determined and found to be (120,187, 26,558 and 14,574) and (0.090, 0.034 and 0.012), respectively. As seen in the inset (1) of Fig. 3(b), tanδ value of less than 0.05 for Zn10-2 ceramic is in a wide frequency range of 100–80000 Hz, while that of the Zn05-2 ceramic is in a narrow frequency range of 300–5000 Hz. It is notable that tanδ value of Ti01-2 ceramic is higher than 0.05 in the whole range of frequency measurement. Interestingly, tanδ values at 30 °C of Zn10-2 and Zn05-2 ceramics greatly decrease to approximately 7.5 and 3 times less than that of the Ti01-2 ceramic, whereas their ε
                     ′ values are still perfectly high (higher than 1.2 × 104) enough for capacitor application. Interestingly, the lowest tanδ value is obtained in the Zn10-2 ceramic, which is suggested to originate from the highest R
                     
                        gb
                      value (the highest potential barrier at grain boundary). As obviously seen in the inset (2) of Fig. 3(b), the highest E
                     
                        b
                      value of 6029.65 V.cm−1 is obtained for the Zn10-2 ceramic with the lower values of 683.05 and 3070.25 V.cm−1 for Ti01–2 and Zn05-2 samples, respectively. In addition, α values were determined and found to be 5.63, 7.57 and 13.29 for the Ti01-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics, respectively. Interestingly, it is found that tanδ values at 30 °C of all Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics are lower and valid in a wider frequency range than those reported in literature for undoped and doped CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramics [15,21,24–28,30,31] with the comparable values to those reported in literature for capacitor materials sintered at high temperature [47–49]. According to their high performance of dielectric properties (high ε
                     ′ and very low tanδ) of all Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics, they are suggested for X8R and X9R capacitor applications.
Remarkably, α and E
                     
                        b
                      values of Ti01-1 and Ti01-2 ceramics can be improved by Zn2+ doping. The highest E
                     b values in the Zn05-1 ceramic (~13146.25 V.cm−1) and the Zn10-2 ceramic (~6029.65 V.cm−1) correspond to the lowest tanδ values of them, as obviously seen in the inset (1) and (2) of Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. In addition, α values of Ti01-1 and Ti01–2 ceramics increase with increasing the Zn2+ doping content, as shown in Table 2. The highest α values obtained in Zn10-1 (α ~49.66) and Zn10-2 (α ~13.29) ceramics are comparable with those reported in literature [2,21,22,50] and the varistor material ZnO [51]. It is remarkable that the improvement of E
                     b and α values might originate from an immense enhancement of R
                     
                        gb
                     , resulting from the Zn2+ dopants and the existence of TiO2-rich phase.
In order to commercialize these ceramic samples for capacitor application, besides the high ε
                     ′ and low tanδ, the Δε
                     ′ value within a valid range of ±15% is an important factor to be considered. Principally, this Δε
                     ′ value is defined for X9R, X8R, X7R and X5R capacitors in a different temperature range (ΔT) of −55 to 200 °C, −55 to 150 °C, −55 to 125 °C and −55 to 85 °C, respectively [52]. As seen in 
                     Fig. 4(a) and (b) are the temperature dependence of Δε
                     ′ for all ceramic samples determined at 30 °C and 1 kHz. From Fig. 4(a) and (b), the validity of temperature range (ΔT) for Δε
                     ′ < ±15% of all ceramic samples were determined and listed in Table 2. As seen in Table 2, Zn05-1, Zn10-2, Zn10-1 and Zn05-2 ceramics can be adequately applied for the EIA code X9R, X8R, X7R and X5R capacitors, respectively. Remarkably, a valid temperature range (Δε
                     ′ < ±15%) for X9R capacitor were rarely reported for CCTO-based compounds [2,4–6,9,15,17,19,36]. Thus, it is suggested that Zn2+-doped Ti01 ceramics is one of the most efficient materials, having appropriate dielectric properties for application in all kinds of capacitor including the X9R one. To our knowledge, this discovery has never been reported in literature for CCTO-based ceramics. Fig. 4(c) and (d) display the temperature dependence of ε
                     ′ in a range of −60 to 210 °C for all ceramic samples. It is clearly seen in Fig. 4(c) and (d) that ε
                     ′ of undoped Ti01 (Ti01-1 and Ti01-2) ceramics slightly increase with increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the Zn2+-doped Ti01 (Zn05-1 and Zn10-2) ceramics are independent on the temperature in the range of −60 to 210 °C. It is also found that temperature dependence of ε
                     ′ for undoped Ti01 ceramics is similar to those observed in CCTO-based ceramics reported in literature [3,27]. Interestingly, Zn2+ doping in Ti01 ceramics contributes not only the temperature stability of ε
                     ′, but also concurrently improve the temperature stability of tanδ. Fig. 4(e) and (f) display tanδ values at 1 kHz as a function of temperature for all ceramic samples. As seen in Fig. 4(e) and (f), tanδ values of both undoped Ti01 ceramics are higher than 0.05 when temperature increases above −30 °C, while those of the Zn05-1, Zn10-1, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics occur above 150 °C, 70 °C, 50 °C and 110 °C, respectively. Surprisingly, tanδ values of the Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics are less than 0.05 over the ΔT of −60 to 150 °C and −60 to 110 °C, respectively. This behavior of tanδ values in a wide temperature range has never been formerly reported in CCTO-based compounds [1,2,5,15] and other related materials [10,11,18]. The ΔT of Δε
                     ′ < ±15% and tanδ < 0.05 for all ceramic samples are listed in Table 2. Notably, very high ε
                     ′ and very low tanδ values with the excellent temperature stability of ε
                     ′ in Zn-doped Ti01 ceramics can be accomplished by optimization the concentration of Zn2+ dopant and appropriate sintering conditions. Remarkably, very high performance dielectric properties of Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics are infrequent to achieve in pure, doped, and co-doped CCTO based ceramics.
In order to investigate the distribution of Ca, Cu, Ti, and O elements in high performance dielectric Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics, mappings of these elements in both ceramics were performed using EDXS technique. EDXS results (not show) confirm the existence of Ca: Cu: Ti: O element in both grain (point 1) and grain boundary (point 2), as shown in Fig. 2(f) for Zn10-2 ceramic. However, EDXS peak of Zn metal cannot be observed in both GBs and grain, due to the low concentration of Zn2+ ions and the low resolution limit of the instrument and/or the existence of them as a liquid film at the GB, which is difficult to detect. Obviously seen in 
                     Fig. 5(a) and (b), the Ca, Cu, Ti, and O mapping images intensely confirm the existence of Ca, Cu, Ti, and O elements. As illustrated in Fig. 5(a) and (b), TiO2-rich phase (green lines) is observed along the GBs regions in both Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics. Furthermore, CaTiO3 secondary phase can be detected at the GBs in Zn10-2 ceramic. Obviously, only Ca, Ti and O elemental mapping are observed in the yellow dash circle in Fig. 5(b).
To further understand the diversity in the values of ε

                        gb
                      value and the R
                     
                        g
                      value is determined from the nonzero intercept on the Z

                     Fig. 6(a) shows the frequency dependence of -Z″ of the Zn10-1 ceramic in the temperature range of 130–200 °C. As seen in Fig. 6(a), the peak height decreases with increasing temperature. In addition, the relaxation peaks occur at a low frequency range when the temperature decreases. As illustrated in Fig. 6(b), the peak height of ceramic samples sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h increases with increasing Zn2+ doping content to x = 0.05 (Zn05-1 ceramic), and further decreases for x = 0.10 (Zn10-1 ceramic). Obviously, both peaks shift to a lower frequency. Similarly, the peak height of ceramic samples sintered at 1100 °C for 5 h (Fig. 6(c)) is approximate the same for x = 0.05 with the shift of peak to a higher frequency. Differently, the highest peak is observed for Zn10-2 ceramic with the shift of peak to a lower frequency. In general, R
                     
                        gb
                      can be calculated by using the relationship R
                     
                        gb
                      = 2Z″max, where Z″max is the maximum peak height. As seen in Fig. 6(b) and (c), at 190 °C, R
                     
                        gb
                      values of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are found to be 453, 413,190 and 18,951 Ω.cm, respectively. Meanwhile, those of Ti01–2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics are 1272, 1074 and 60,693 Ω.cm, respectively. Notably, these R
                     
                        gb
                      values are consistent with the peak height (Z″max) and the low tanδ value of each ceramic. Moreover, the maximum R
                     
                        gb
                      values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics correspond to the lowest tanδ values of them, as seen in the insets (1) of Fig. 4(e) and (f). This behavior is similar to those observed in other CCTO-based ceramics reported in literature [54–60]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the very high performance dielectric (high ε
                     ′ and low tanδ) can be achieved in Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics, resulting from the high R

                     gb values of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics were calculated and found to be 0.603, 0.636 and 0.614 eV, respectively. For Ti01–2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics, E

                     gb values are observed in Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics, corresponding to the lowest tanδ values of both ceramics. The values of E
                     gb for all ceramics are listed in Table 2. It is notable that the E
                     gb values of Zn2+-doped Ti01 ceramics significantly increase with increasing Zn2+ doping content, suggesting the decrease of oxygen vacancy at grain boundary. Generally, substitution of Zn2+ ions at the Cu2+ site does not generate free electron. Thus, the decrease of oxygen vacancy in these Zn2+-doped Ti01 ceramic might be related with the concentration of the single- and double-ionized oxygen vacancy [62], as expressed by Eqs. (2)–(5). In general, under the sintering process, oxygen vacancies can be generated by the release of oxygen from the crystal structure (Eq. (2)).

                      are the double- and single-ionized oxygen vacancy, respectively. According to Eq. (5), electron ionized from oxygen vacancy can be trapped at Ti4+ site leading to the reduction of Ti3+. However, with increasing Zn2+ doping content, Ti3+ ions are not observed to increase due to their small amount compare to Ti4+ ions arisen from the TiO2 phase (as shown by the XRD results).
In order to verify the oxidation state of Ti ions in all ceramic samples, XANES measurements were performed. As shown in 
                     Fig. 7(a) and (b) are the normalized Ti K-edge XANES spectra of Ti2O3 (Ti3+) and TiO2 (Ti4+) standards with those of ceramic samples sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h and 1100 °C for 5 h, respectively. In Fig. 7(a) and (b), it is observed that the energy edge positions of Ti2O3 and TiO2 standards appear at approximately 4977.00 and 4979.60 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, those of the Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1, Ti01-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics appear at approximately 4979.48, 4979.50, 4979.56, 4979.49, 4979.55 and 4979.56 eV, respectively. It is obviously seen that the energy edge positions of these ceramic samples are close to the value 4979.76 eV of the standard TiO2, indicating the oxidation state of +4 for Ti ions in all of these samples. However, the slight change in energy edge positions of these ceramic samples can be observed, indicating the existence of Ti3+ ions. According to our previous work [36], the percentage ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ ions for these ceramic samples sintered at different conditions were calculated and found to decrease with increasing Zn2+ doping content. These results indicate the n-type semiconducting grain of these ceramic samples, occurring by the electron hopping between Ti3+ and Ti4+ ions. Therefore, it is suggested that the promotion of oxygen vacancies is influenced by Zn2+ doping content. The calculated percentage ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ ions for all ceramic samples are summarized in Table 2.

Conclusion:
The dielectric properties of CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics can be successfully improved by doping with Zn2+ ions. The decrease in grain sizes and the existence of TiO2 at grain boundary due to the Zn2+ doping are suggested to be the important factors in the reduction of tanδ value. Very high performance dielectric properties of giant dielectric constants (ε
                     ′~9200) and very low tanδ (~0.017) at 1 kHz with the perfect temperature coefficient (Δε
                     ′) less than ±15% in a wide temperature range of −60 °C to 210 °C are successfully accomplished in the CaCu2.95Zn0.05Ti4.1O12 ceramic sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h. It is suggested that this ceramic has a potential to be applied for the EIA code X8R and X9R capacitors. Moreover, the excellent nonlinear properties with α ~ 25.94 and E

                     30 °C) of the CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) [1–9] and related compounds [10–12] have been continuously studied and become even more attractive issue for researchers. Although these dielectric materials have been extensively investigated, however it was infrequently successful to achieve all requirements of very high dielectric performance in a wide temperature and frequency range, especially for the X8R and X9R capacitors. In general, the EIA code X8R and X9R capacitors are operated at a temperature higher than 125 °C without external cooling, which is a requirement for aerospace, military mobile communications and energy production industries [13]. In addition, it is specific that the condition of Δε
                     ′ to satisfy for X8R and X9R capacitors should be less than ±15% in a temperature range of −55 to 150 °C and −55 to 200 °C, respectively. Accordingly, investigation for X8R capacitors has been extensively studied and there are only a few articles that reported for CCTO-based compound [2,14,15]. However, there are no reports for X9R capacitor based on CCTO ceramic materials. Generally, X9R capacitors have been intensively studied and reported in ferroelectric perovskite compounds [13,16], normally sintered at high temperature, which is a disadvantage of the preparation process due to high energy consumption and might probably cause a seriously environmental problem. In order to improve the dielectric and electrical properties with a novel satisfy condition for Δε 
                     ′ of CCTO-based compound to meet the X8R and X9R capacitors, many approaches have been proposed for the preparation of the materials such as (1) doping and co-doping with various metals in CCTO ceramics to improve the electrical properties of grain boundaries (GBs) [2,17–19], (2) doping with some metals in CCTO/CaTiO3 composites [15,20], (3) using appropriate sintering conditions to enhance GB layers [21–23] and (4) increasing the Ti molar concentration in CCTO compound to produce TiO2-rich CCTO ceramics [24–27], Among these approaches, (1), (2) and (3) are the most ones that have been intensively reported [15,17–19,28,29] with a few of them that can successfully achieve for X8R capacitors such as the studies on Mg2+ doped CCTO/CaTiO3 
                     [15], La3+ doped CCTO [8] and Zn-doping CCTO [2]. Furthermore, the study by approach (4) reported only the dielectric properties at room temperature without the study of Δε 
                     ′. For instance, Lin and coworkers [25] reported the effect of TiO2-rich in the microstructure and dielectric properties of CCTO (CaCu3Ti4+xO12; x = 0.00–1.5) ceramics prepared by solid state reaction method. They found that TiO2 impurity phase trended to increase with increasing Ti content, resulting in the decrease of ε 
                     ′ and tanδ values to ~4233 and ~0.03, respectively. In addition to this, the nonlinear J–E properties could be improved as well. Ouyang and coworkers [24] reported the dielectric properties (ε 
                     ′ ~5.5 ×104 and tanδ ~0.2) of TiO2-rich CCTO ceramics derived by a sol gel method. Hao and coworkers [30] reported the preparation of CCTO/xTiO2 (x = 0.0–2.0) ceramics by using a sol gel technique and found that the tanδ and ε 
                     ′ values decreased with increasing Ti content, due to the presence of TiO2 secondary phase. Other than this, it was also found that the CCTO/TiO2 composite ceramics had an advantage over the ferroelectric perovskite materials, because it could be prepared by a one-step process from a nominal CaCu3Ti4+xO12 composition [24,25] with sintering temperature lower than that of ferroelectric perovskite compounds. Consequently, it will be superior that the dielectric properties, nonlinear characteristics and Δε 
                     ′ of the CCTO/TiO2 ceramics can be concurrently improved with a novel innovation that might support the capacitors technology. Recently, it was also found that Zn2+ doping in CCTO-based ceramics [2,31–34] and co-doping with others metal [19,35] could improve not only the electrical properties, but also simultaneously enhance the Δε 
                     ′. For instance, high performance dielectric properties with the satisfy Δε 
                     ′ for X8R capacitor could be achieved in the Zn2+ ions doped CaCu2Ti4O12 ceramics [2]. According to this report and literature, it is supposed that Zn2+-doped CaCu2Ti4O12/TiO2 ceramics could simultaneously improve the dielectric properties with the satisfy Δε 
                     ′ for the X8R and X9R capacitors.

In this work, CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 (x = 0.00, 0.05 and 0.10) precursor powders were prepared by the polymer pyrolysis (PP) solution method [9,20]. Effect of Zn2+ doping on the dielectric properties, nonlinear (J–E curve) characteristics and Δε 
                     ′ of all ceramic samples prepared from these precursor powders were studied and discussed based on the promotion of oxygen vacancy at grain boundary (GB). Interestingly, excellent dielectric properties (ε

CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 (x = 0.00, 0.05 and 0.10, abbreviated as Ti01, Zn05 and Zn10, respectively) powders were prepared by the PP method. Acrylic acid (CH2 =CHCOOH, Sigma Aldrich), Ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O4), Calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O), Zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), Copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) and Titanium solution (C16H28O6Ti 75 wt% in isopropanol) were employed as starting materials. The complete details of the PP method were described in our previous work [9]. The pellets of Ti01, Zn05 and Zn10 samples with approximate thickness of 1 mm and diameter of 9 mm were prepared by using the uniaxial compression at ~50 MPa. These pellet samples were sintered in air at two different sintering conditions of 1060 °C for 8 h (abbreviated as Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics) and 1100 °C for 5 h (abbreviated as Ti01-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics).

Microstructure and elemental mapping of ceramic samples were explored by scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6510LV, Oxford Instrument) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDXS). Standard line intercept technique was used to calculate the average grain sizes (AGs) of ceramic samples. Phase compositions were investigated by X-ray diffraction (Bruker/D8 Advance; Bruker BioSpin AG; λ = 0.15406 nm). Prior to measurements of dielectric properties and nonlinear J–E curves, all ceramic pellets were polished and cleaned on both sides to obtain the smooth surfaces. Subsequently, both surfaces were coated with Au using a sputtering unit (Polaron SC500). Dielectric properties were measured in a wide temperature (−60 to 210 °C) and frequency (100 Hz to 1 MHz) ranges using an impedance gain phase analyzer (Hewlett Packard 4194A). Nonlinear J–E curves were examined at 30 °C using a high voltage measurement unit (Keithley Model 247). Two important values of nonlinear characteristics i.e. breakdown electric field (E
                     
                        b
                     ) and nonlinear coefficient (α) were determined by a method described in our previous work [21,36]. The oxidation state of Ti ion in ceramic samples were verified using X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, Multiple X-ray, Energy 4–18 keV, Current 100 mA, 107–1010 photon s−1). The percentage of Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio in all ceramic samples was calculated using equation provided in our previous work [36]. The complete details of XANES technique and data analysis were described elsewhere [37,38].

Fig. 1(a)–(f) display the Rietveld refinement profile fits (RRPFs) [39] of the XRD patterns of all ceramic samples, which can be identified to correspond with the standard data for CaCu3Ti4O12 (ICSD card No.95714), having the body center cubic (bcc) structure. As expected, a minor peak of TiO2 phase (ICSD card No. 26715) is observed in the XRD patterns of all Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics with no detection of ZnO impurity phase due to the insensitivity of the XRD technique to any phase of concentration less than 0.5 wt% [40,41]. According to the RRPFs, the CaCu3Ti4O12:TiO2 ratios of Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1, T101-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics were determined and found to be 100.0:0.0, 97.9:2.1, 94.9:5.1, 100.0:0.0, 97.0:3.0, 95.7:4.3, respectively. It is notable that the TiO2 fraction significantly increases with increasing Zn2+ doping content. According to the RRPFs, lattice parameters (a), theoretical densities (D
                     
                        xrd
                     ), GOF and the quality of the refinement of all ceramic samples are determined and all of the results are listed in 
                     Table 1. The RRPFs of high quality for all ceramic samples are confirmed by the low values of goodness of fit (GOF) in a range of ~1.2–1.5 and those of the residual (R
                     p, R
                     exp and R
                     wp) values in a range of ~7‒11%, where R
                     p is the profile residual, R
                     exp is the expected residual and R
                     wp is the weighted profile residual, as seen in Table 1. In addition, the lattice parameter a values of all ceramic samples reveal no significant change with the increase of Zn2+ content due to the slightly different ionic radius of Cu2+ (0.87 Å) and Zn2+ (0.88 Å). Moreover, all lattice parameters (a) are comparable with that of the CCTO ceramics (a = 7.391 Å) reported in literature [21,42]. Additionally, the theoretical densities (D
                     
                        xrd
                     ) of undoped-CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics are lower than those of the Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics due to the replacement of a lighter Cu atom (63.546 amu) by a heavier Zn atom (65.380 amu).

Generally, dielectric and nonlinear characteristic of CCTO-based ceramics are significantly dependent on their microstructure [21,43]. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the microstructure evolutions of these CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 ceramics. 
                     Fig. 2(a)–(c) and (d)–(f) are SEM images of polished surface-ceramic samples sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h and 1100 °C for 5 h, respectively. The average grain sizes (AGs) of these samples were determined and summarized in Table 1. Obviously seen in Table 1 that, the AGs of all ceramic samples decrease with increasing Zn2+ doping content due to the solute drag mechanism [36,44] originate from the slight difference in ionic radii of Zn2+ (0.86 Å) dopant and Cu2+ (0.87 Å) host ions, including the existence of TiO2 phase. Furthermore, AGs of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics significantly increase with the sintering temperature, as obviously seen in Table 1. This behavior is similar to those observed in the microstructure of CCTO-based ceramics [21,23].

The frequency dependence of ε
                     ′ and tanδ for Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are shown in 
                     Fig. 3(a) and inset (1) of Fig. 3(a), respectively. In Fig. 3(a), ε
                     ′ values (at 30 °C and 1 kHz) of Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1 ceramics are found to be 130,566, 9200 and 4985, respectively. It is notable that ε
                     ′ value of Ti01-1 ceramic decreases with increasing Zn2+ content. Interestingly, ε
                     ′ values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are almost stable in the frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 MHz and further rapidly drop above 1 MHz, while that of Ti01-1 ceramic slightly decreases in the range of 100 Hz to 0.2 MHz and then rapidly drop above 0.2 MHz. The rapid drop of ε
                     ′ in these ceramic samples is attributed to the Maxwell-Wagner relaxation model. According to this model, the dielectric relaxation is governed by the difference of electrical response of the grain and grain boundaries (GBs), which cause charge accumulation at the GBs [45,46]. In addition, it is found that ε
                     ′ values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are approximately 14 and 26 times lower than that of the Ti01-1 ceramic. Nevertheless, these values are still large and sufficient for commercial applications. In addition to a high ε
                     ′ value, tanδ value of a commercial dielectric material should be less than 0.05 [23]. As seen in the inset (1) of Fig. 3(a), at 30 °C and 1 kHz, tanδ values are found to be 0.09, 0.017 and 0.026 for Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1 ceramics, respectively. Surprisingly, it is found that tanδ values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are under the red dashed line (the red dashed line signifies tanδ = 0.05) in a wide frequency range of 100–30,000 Hz and 100–10,000 Hz, respectively. Meanwhile, tanδ value of Ti01-1 ceramic is above this red dashed line with value higher than 0.05 for the whole range of frequency. Inset (2) of Fig. 3(a) displays a nonlinear J–E characteristic of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics. At 30 °C, α and E
                     
                        b
                      value of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics were determined and found to be (4.51, 25.94, 49.66) and (599.45, 13146.25, 6626.06 V.cm−1), respectively. It is obvious that the lowest tanδ value of 0.017 observed in the Zn05-1 ceramic is consistent with the highest E
                     
                        b
                      value. This might be due to the very high grain boundary resistance (R
                     
                        gb
                     ), resulting from the TiO2-rich and Zn2+-doping effect. All values of ε

                        b
                      of these ceramics are summarized in 
                     Table 2.

Fig. 3(b) and its inset (1) display the frequency dependence of ε
                     ′ and tanδ of Ti01–2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics. At 30 °C and 1 kHz, ε
                     ′ and tanδ value of Ti01–2, Zn05-2, Zn10-2 ceramics were determined and found to be (120,187, 26,558 and 14,574) and (0.090, 0.034 and 0.012), respectively. As seen in the inset (1) of Fig. 3(b), tanδ value of less than 0.05 for Zn10-2 ceramic is in a wide frequency range of 100–80000 Hz, while that of the Zn05-2 ceramic is in a narrow frequency range of 300–5000 Hz. It is notable that tanδ value of Ti01-2 ceramic is higher than 0.05 in the whole range of frequency measurement. Interestingly, tanδ values at 30 °C of Zn10-2 and Zn05-2 ceramics greatly decrease to approximately 7.5 and 3 times less than that of the Ti01-2 ceramic, whereas their ε
                     ′ values are still perfectly high (higher than 1.2 × 104) enough for capacitor application. Interestingly, the lowest tanδ value is obtained in the Zn10-2 ceramic, which is suggested to originate from the highest R
                     
                        gb
                      value (the highest potential barrier at grain boundary). As obviously seen in the inset (2) of Fig. 3(b), the highest E
                     
                        b
                      value of 6029.65 V.cm−1 is obtained for the Zn10-2 ceramic with the lower values of 683.05 and 3070.25 V.cm−1 for Ti01–2 and Zn05-2 samples, respectively. In addition, α values were determined and found to be 5.63, 7.57 and 13.29 for the Ti01-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics, respectively. Interestingly, it is found that tanδ values at 30 °C of all Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics are lower and valid in a wider frequency range than those reported in literature for undoped and doped CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramics [15,21,24–28,30,31] with the comparable values to those reported in literature for capacitor materials sintered at high temperature [47–49]. According to their high performance of dielectric properties (high ε
                     ′ and very low tanδ) of all Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics, they are suggested for X8R and X9R capacitor applications.

Remarkably, α and E
                     
                        b
                      values of Ti01-1 and Ti01-2 ceramics can be improved by Zn2+ doping. The highest E
                     b values in the Zn05-1 ceramic (~13146.25 V.cm−1) and the Zn10-2 ceramic (~6029.65 V.cm−1) correspond to the lowest tanδ values of them, as obviously seen in the inset (1) and (2) of Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. In addition, α values of Ti01-1 and Ti01–2 ceramics increase with increasing the Zn2+ doping content, as shown in Table 2. The highest α values obtained in Zn10-1 (α ~49.66) and Zn10-2 (α ~13.29) ceramics are comparable with those reported in literature [2,21,22,50] and the varistor material ZnO [51]. It is remarkable that the improvement of E
                     b and α values might originate from an immense enhancement of R
                     
                        gb
                     , resulting from the Zn2+ dopants and the existence of TiO2-rich phase.

In order to commercialize these ceramic samples for capacitor application, besides the high ε
                     ′ and low tanδ, the Δε
                     ′ value within a valid range of ±15% is an important factor to be considered. Principally, this Δε
                     ′ value is defined for X9R, X8R, X7R and X5R capacitors in a different temperature range (ΔT) of −55 to 200 °C, −55 to 150 °C, −55 to 125 °C and −55 to 85 °C, respectively [52]. As seen in 
                     Fig. 4(a) and (b) are the temperature dependence of Δε
                     ′ for all ceramic samples determined at 30 °C and 1 kHz. From Fig. 4(a) and (b), the validity of temperature range (ΔT) for Δε
                     ′ < ±15% of all ceramic samples were determined and listed in Table 2. As seen in Table 2, Zn05-1, Zn10-2, Zn10-1 and Zn05-2 ceramics can be adequately applied for the EIA code X9R, X8R, X7R and X5R capacitors, respectively. Remarkably, a valid temperature range (Δε
                     ′ < ±15%) for X9R capacitor were rarely reported for CCTO-based compounds [2,4–6,9,15,17,19,36]. Thus, it is suggested that Zn2+-doped Ti01 ceramics is one of the most efficient materials, having appropriate dielectric properties for application in all kinds of capacitor including the X9R one. To our knowledge, this discovery has never been reported in literature for CCTO-based ceramics. Fig. 4(c) and (d) display the temperature dependence of ε
                     ′ in a range of −60 to 210 °C for all ceramic samples. It is clearly seen in Fig. 4(c) and (d) that ε
                     ′ of undoped Ti01 (Ti01-1 and Ti01-2) ceramics slightly increase with increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the Zn2+-doped Ti01 (Zn05-1 and Zn10-2) ceramics are independent on the temperature in the range of −60 to 210 °C. It is also found that temperature dependence of ε
                     ′ for undoped Ti01 ceramics is similar to those observed in CCTO-based ceramics reported in literature [3,27]. Interestingly, Zn2+ doping in Ti01 ceramics contributes not only the temperature stability of ε
                     ′, but also concurrently improve the temperature stability of tanδ. Fig. 4(e) and (f) display tanδ values at 1 kHz as a function of temperature for all ceramic samples. As seen in Fig. 4(e) and (f), tanδ values of both undoped Ti01 ceramics are higher than 0.05 when temperature increases above −30 °C, while those of the Zn05-1, Zn10-1, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics occur above 150 °C, 70 °C, 50 °C and 110 °C, respectively. Surprisingly, tanδ values of the Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics are less than 0.05 over the ΔT of −60 to 150 °C and −60 to 110 °C, respectively. This behavior of tanδ values in a wide temperature range has never been formerly reported in CCTO-based compounds [1,2,5,15] and other related materials [10,11,18]. The ΔT of Δε
                     ′ < ±15% and tanδ < 0.05 for all ceramic samples are listed in Table 2. Notably, very high ε
                     ′ and very low tanδ values with the excellent temperature stability of ε
                     ′ in Zn-doped Ti01 ceramics can be accomplished by optimization the concentration of Zn2+ dopant and appropriate sintering conditions. Remarkably, very high performance dielectric properties of Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics are infrequent to achieve in pure, doped, and co-doped CCTO based ceramics.

In order to investigate the distribution of Ca, Cu, Ti, and O elements in high performance dielectric Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics, mappings of these elements in both ceramics were performed using EDXS technique. EDXS results (not show) confirm the existence of Ca: Cu: Ti: O element in both grain (point 1) and grain boundary (point 2), as shown in Fig. 2(f) for Zn10-2 ceramic. However, EDXS peak of Zn metal cannot be observed in both GBs and grain, due to the low concentration of Zn2+ ions and the low resolution limit of the instrument and/or the existence of them as a liquid film at the GB, which is difficult to detect. Obviously seen in 
                     Fig. 5(a) and (b), the Ca, Cu, Ti, and O mapping images intensely confirm the existence of Ca, Cu, Ti, and O elements. As illustrated in Fig. 5(a) and (b), TiO2-rich phase (green lines) is observed along the GBs regions in both Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics. Furthermore, CaTiO3 secondary phase can be detected at the GBs in Zn10-2 ceramic. Obviously, only Ca, Ti and O elemental mapping are observed in the yellow dash circle in Fig. 5(b).

To further understand the diversity in the values of ε
                     ′ and tanδ for all ceramic samples, the grain and grain boundary resistance (R
                     
                        g
                      and R
                     
                        gb
                     ) are investigated and discussed. In principle, R
                     
                        g
                      and R
                     
                        gb
                      of CCTO-based compounds are determined by the semicircular arc at high- and low-frequency range of impedance complex plane (Z*) plot, respectively [1,2,6,9,22,29,53]. In some case, Z* plot shows only the semicircular arc for the determination of R
                     
                        gb
                      value and the R
                     
                        g
                      value is determined from the nonzero intercept on the Z
                     
                        ′
                      axis [1]. 
                     Fig. 6(a) shows the frequency dependence of -Z″ of the Zn10-1 ceramic in the temperature range of 130–200 °C. As seen in Fig. 6(a), the peak height decreases with increasing temperature. In addition, the relaxation peaks occur at a low frequency range when the temperature decreases. As illustrated in Fig. 6(b), the peak height of ceramic samples sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h increases with increasing Zn2+ doping content to x = 0.05 (Zn05-1 ceramic), and further decreases for x = 0.10 (Zn10-1 ceramic). Obviously, both peaks shift to a lower frequency. Similarly, the peak height of ceramic samples sintered at 1100 °C for 5 h (Fig. 6(c)) is approximate the same for x = 0.05 with the shift of peak to a higher frequency. Differently, the highest peak is observed for Zn10-2 ceramic with the shift of peak to a lower frequency. In general, R
                     
                        gb
                      can be calculated by using the relationship R
                     
                        gb
                      = 2Z″max, where Z″max is the maximum peak height. As seen in Fig. 6(b) and (c), at 190 °C, R
                     
                        gb
                      values of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are found to be 453, 413,190 and 18,951 Ω.cm, respectively. Meanwhile, those of Ti01–2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics are 1272, 1074 and 60,693 Ω.cm, respectively. Notably, these R
                     
                        gb
                      values are consistent with the peak height (Z″max) and the low tanδ value of each ceramic. Moreover, the maximum R
                     
                        gb
                      values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics correspond to the lowest tanδ values of them, as seen in the insets (1) of Fig. 4(e) and (f). This behavior is similar to those observed in other CCTO-based ceramics reported in literature [54–60]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the very high performance dielectric (high ε
                     ′ and low tanδ) can be achieved in Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics, resulting from the high R
                     
                        gb
                      value of each sample.

                     gb is the activation energy for conduction at grain boundaries. By using Eq. (1) and slope of each ceramic sample (as seen in Fig. 6(d) and its inset), E
                     gb values of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics were calculated and found to be 0.603, 0.636 and 0.614 eV, respectively. For Ti01–2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics, E
                     gb are evaluated to be 0.636, 0.619 and 0.642 eV, respectively. These E
                     gb values are comparable with those values previously reported for CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramics (E

                     gb ~ 0.61–0.81 eV) [17,19,61]. Remarkably, the highest E
                     gb values are observed in Zn05-1 and Zn10-2 ceramics, corresponding to the lowest tanδ values of both ceramics. The values of E
                     gb for all ceramics are listed in Table 2. It is notable that the E
                     gb values of Zn2+-doped Ti01 ceramics significantly increase with increasing Zn2+ doping content, suggesting the decrease of oxygen vacancy at grain boundary. Generally, substitution of Zn2+ ions at the Cu2+ site does not generate free electron. Thus, the decrease of oxygen vacancy in these Zn2+-doped Ti01 ceramic might be related with the concentration of the single- and double-ionized oxygen vacancy [62], as expressed by Eqs. (2)–(5). In general, under the sintering process, oxygen vacancies can be generated by the release of oxygen from the crystal structure (Eq. (2)).

                      are the double- and single-ionized oxygen vacancy, respectively. According to Eq. (5), electron ionized from oxygen vacancy can be trapped at Ti4+ site leading to the reduction of Ti3+. However, with increasing Zn2+ doping content, Ti3+ ions are not observed to increase due to their small amount compare to Ti4+ ions arisen from the TiO2 phase (as shown by the XRD results).

In order to verify the oxidation state of Ti ions in all ceramic samples, XANES measurements were performed. As shown in 
                     Fig. 7(a) and (b) are the normalized Ti K-edge XANES spectra of Ti2O3 (Ti3+) and TiO2 (Ti4+) standards with those of ceramic samples sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h and 1100 °C for 5 h, respectively. In Fig. 7(a) and (b), it is observed that the energy edge positions of Ti2O3 and TiO2 standards appear at approximately 4977.00 and 4979.60 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, those of the Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1, Ti01-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics appear at approximately 4979.48, 4979.50, 4979.56, 4979.49, 4979.55 and 4979.56 eV, respectively. It is obviously seen that the energy edge positions of these ceramic samples are close to the value 4979.76 eV of the standard TiO2, indicating the oxidation state of +4 for Ti ions in all of these samples. However, the slight change in energy edge positions of these ceramic samples can be observed, indicating the existence of Ti3+ ions. According to our previous work [36], the percentage ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ ions for these ceramic samples sintered at different conditions were calculated and found to decrease with increasing Zn2+ doping content. These results indicate the n-type semiconducting grain of these ceramic samples, occurring by the electron hopping between Ti3+ and Ti4+ ions. Therefore, it is suggested that the promotion of oxygen vacancies is influenced by Zn2+ doping content. The calculated percentage ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ ions for all ceramic samples are summarized in Table 2.

The dielectric properties of CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics can be successfully improved by doping with Zn2+ ions. The decrease in grain sizes and the existence of TiO2 at grain boundary due to the Zn2+ doping are suggested to be the important factors in the reduction of tanδ value. Very high performance dielectric properties of giant dielectric constants (ε
                     ′~9200) and very low tanδ (~0.017) at 1 kHz with the perfect temperature coefficient (Δε
                     ′) less than ±15% in a wide temperature range of −60 °C to 210 °C are successfully accomplished in the CaCu2.95Zn0.05Ti4.1O12 ceramic sintered at 1060 °C for 8 h. It is suggested that this ceramic has a potential to be applied for the EIA code X8R and X9R capacitors. Moreover, the excellent nonlinear properties with α ~ 25.94 and E

                      value, resulting from the Zn2+ ions doping and the appropriate sintering conditions.

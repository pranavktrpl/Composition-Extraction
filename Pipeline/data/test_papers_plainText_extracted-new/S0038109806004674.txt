Title:
Size effects on Debye temperature  Einstein temperature  and volume thermal expansion coefficient of nanocrystals

Abstract:
Based on a size-dependent root of mean square amplitude (rms) model, the size-dependent Debye temperatures of nanocrystals are modeled without any adjustable parameter by considering both Lindemann’s criterion and Mott’s equation. In terms of this model, the Debye temperatures depend on both size and interface conditions, which lead to related applications on size effects of the Einstein temperature and the volume thermal expansion coefficient. It is found that the model’s predictions are in good agreement with available experimental and computer simulation results.

Introduction:
The physical properties of nanocrystals have been investigated extensively both theoretically and experimentally due to their scientific and industrial importance [1]. As the size of low-dimensional materials decreases to the nanometer size range, the electronic, magnetic, optic, catalytic, and thermodynamic properties of the materials are significantly altered from those of either the bulk or a single molecule [1]. Among these properties of nanocrystals, the Debye temperature of nanocrystals,

It is now known that the above physical properties of a free nanocrystal decrease as its 
                        D
                      decreases [2,7,9,13], while they can decrease or increase for nanocrystals embedded in a matrix or deposited on a substrate [3–6,8,10–12]. A body of evidence shows that enhancement or depression of the foregoing physical properties of nanocrystals in a matrix essentially depends on the chemical interaction at interfaces between embedded nanocrystals and the matrix [3–6,8,10–12]. For instance, when the interfaces are coherent or semi-coherent, which denotes a strong bond connection, the enhancement of

                      of the nanocrystals is present [11,12]. Although size effects on all of the above physical properties have been modeled separately by a series of related theoretical approaches, consistent insight and a systematic thermodynamic treatment considering both the size and interface effects are highly desirable in order to reveal the physical nature of the nanocrystals.

                      (parameters used for other figures are also listed in this table). It is obvious that our model predictions for different kinds of nanocrystals in different surroundings correspond to the experimental and computer simulation results in the full size range, which implies that Eq. (9) is reasonable.

                      functions for different kinds of nanocrystals and different surroundings can be described as long as the related thermodynamic parameters of crystals are known. The physical nature of the enhancement or suppression of these physical properties is related to both the surface/volume ratio and the interfacial energetic change between embedded nanocrystals and the matrix.

Body:
The physical properties of nanocrystals have been investigated extensively both theoretically and experimentally due to their scientific and industrial importance [1]. As the size of low-dimensional materials decreases to the nanometer size range, the electronic, magnetic, optic, catalytic, and thermodynamic properties of the materials are significantly altered from those of either the bulk or a single molecule [1]. Among these properties of nanocrystals, the Debye temperature of nanocrystals,

It is now known that the above physical properties of a free nanocrystal decrease as its 
                        D
                      decreases [2,7,9,13], while they can decrease or increase for nanocrystals embedded in a matrix or deposited on a substrate [3–6,8,10–12]. A body of evidence shows that enhancement or depression of the foregoing physical properties of nanocrystals in a matrix essentially depends on the chemical interaction at interfaces between embedded nanocrystals and the matrix [3–6,8,10–12]. For instance, when the interfaces are coherent or semi-coherent, which denotes a strong bond connection, the enhancement of 
                        
                           
                              Θ

                      of the nanocrystals is present [11,12]. Although size effects on all of the above physical properties have been modeled separately by a series of related theoretical approaches, consistent insight and a systematic thermodynamic treatment considering both the size and interface effects are highly desirable in order to reveal the physical nature of the nanocrystals.

                      functions for different kinds of nanocrystals and different surroundings can be described as long as the related thermodynamic parameters of crystals are known. The physical nature of the enhancement or suppression of these physical properties is related to both the surface/volume ratio and the interfacial energetic change between embedded nanocrystals and the matrix.

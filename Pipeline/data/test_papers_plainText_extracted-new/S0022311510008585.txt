Abstract:
Systematic scans using D2 gas puffing and impurity-seeding (Ne, N2) have been carried out on ELMy-H and Advanced-Tokamak-like discharges to study power deposition amelioration at the divertor target plates in preparation for the JET ITER-Like Wall (ILW). Hereby it has been discovered that the recycling ion fluxes I
                     div to the outer target plate exhibit a clear connection to pedestal ne
                      and Te, whereby the Dα photon flux Φ
                     Dα from the outer divertor serves here as an approximate measure of I
                     div. Φ
                     Dα can be expressed as (ne
                     /Te
                     )

                      with β
                     =2.5/3 depending on the scenario (EH/AT). This coupling between SOL and pedestal across the edge transport barrier (ETB) is associated with a close connection between ne
                      and Te

Introduction:
With use of tungsten target plates for the JET ILW, now under construction, carbon radiation will be reduced and must be replaced by that of extrinsic impurities to exploit ILW high power capabilities [1]. Studies of ELMy-H (EH) and Advanced-Tokamak-like (AT) scenarios using N2- and Ne-seeding along with D2 fuelling have been carried out in matrix fashion [2], aiming to cover a large range in divertor power loading P
                     div and temperature

                     . The outer strike point (OSP) is placed on the horizontal target, as foreseen for primary ILW operation. The intended purpose of impurity seeding is to augment radiation P
                     rad in order to mitigate P
                     div and that of D2 to enhance recycling to further reduce P

                      afforded by impurities as well as the extent of fuelling, pushing the OSP into power detachment at the highest values (for EH with moderate cost in confinement loss). Type-I ELM behavior also varies: For EH f
                     ELM initially decreases with D2 (∼20→10Hz, Fig. 1
                     ). Further, impurities can provoke compound ELMs (f
                     ELM
                     ⩾3Hz) as well as augment f
                     ELM (to 50Hz) depending on the impurity species and D2 level (γ
                     D2). f
                     ELM(AT) largely spans the range ∼50–200Hz, increasing with γ
                     D2.

Experimental results:
Although the viewing cone for Φ
                     Dα subtends the entire divertor outside the x-point, Dα emission itself is concentrated around the OSP. Φ
                     Dα is used as a measure of I
                     div due to a lack of comprehensive reliable Langmuir probe measurements. Fig. 1 depicts Dα time traces for an EH γ
                     D2- and Ne-scan, showing the change in ELM behavior as well as increase in Dα level as a function of both γ
                     D2 and Ne. Core ne

                     ∼0.9 and thus integrating over ne
                      outside this region, is an excellent measure of

The connection between I

Previous studies of n

                     E is higher to achieve similar I

With use of tungsten target plates for the JET ILW, now under construction, carbon radiation will be reduced and must be replaced by that of extrinsic impurities to exploit ILW high power capabilities [1].

                      afforded by impurities as well as the extent of fuelling, pushing the OSP into power detachment at the highest values (for EH with moderate cost in confinement loss). Type-I ELM behavior also varies: For EH f
                     ELM initially decreases with D2 (∼20→10Hz, Fig. 1
                     ). Further, impurities can provoke compound ELMs (f
                     ELM
                     ⩾3Hz) as well as augment f
                     ELM (to 50Hz) depending on the impurity species and D2 level (γ
                     D2). f
                     ELM(AT) largely spans the range ∼50–200Hz, increasing with γ
                     D2.

Although the viewing cone for Φ
                     Dα subtends the entire divertor outside the x-point, Dα emission itself is concentrated around the OSP. Φ
                     Dα is used as a measure of I
                     div due to a lack of comprehensive reliable Langmuir probe measurements. Fig. 1 depicts Dα time traces for an EH γ
                     D2- and Ne-scan, showing the change in ELM behavior as well as increase in Dα level as a function of both γ

The connection between I

Previous studies of n

                     ELM (5–13Hz) [7,8]. This observation also holds true for the AT dataset where one finds a well-ordered linear relationship between n

                     E. Whereas this seems compatible with good ELMy H-modes, it remains to be seen whether viable AT scenarios can be developed since the sacrifice in τ
                     E is higher to achieve similar I

Title:
DFT+U study of the structural  electronic and optical properties of M

Abstract:
The aim of this study is to calculate the structural, electronic and optical properties of M1-xPrxF2+x (M = Ba, Ca, x = 0.25). The calculations are performed by the spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) combined with Hubbard U correction method. The band gaps of Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 and Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25are calculated and compared to the binary fluorides BaF2 and CaF2. It is found that the band gaps of the strongly substituted compounds in Praseodymium are smaller than those of the binary materials. The values obtained are 3.21, 2.77, 6.95, 7.14 eV for Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25, Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25, BaF2 and CaF2 respectively.
                  The comparison between Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 and Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25 is discussed by computing the optical parameters using LSDA and LSDA + U approximations, such as dielectric function, refractive index, reflectivity, absorption, extinction coefficient and energy loss function over a wide range of energy, 0.0–40.0eV. These results would provide a theoretical reference for fundamental science as well as technological application of these compounds. The electronic and optical properties predicted in this work for M1-xPrxF2+x (M = Ba, Ca, x = 0.25) may serve as reference for the other experimental and theoretical studies.

Introduction:
Praseodymium belongs to the lanthanide family, it has two f electrons. These electrons are highly localized and are responsible for electronic, magnetic and optical properties. The Pr3+ ion has a particular interest for the realization of solid laser materials in the visible range thanks to its energy levels diagram which presents multicolor transitions in red, orange, green and blue interval. One of the characteristics of praseodymium is that its visible transitions come from the 3P0 level or the levels just below 3P1 and 1I6 which have the advantage for pumping and miniaturization because one can only use a pumping source to obtain several wavelengths. The most important application of the Pr3+targeted is the miniature video projection [1,2]; an application which requires compact and efficient laser sources operating in red, green and blue (RGB).
The fluorides MF2 (M = Sr, Ba, Ca, Cd) are characterized by a high transparency in a large energy range. They have been widely investigated theoretically and experimentally [3–5] due to their wide band gap making them good host matrices for rare earth ions leading to the solid solutions M1-xRxF2+x [6–8]. These compounds are obtained by mixing in stoichiometric proportion Praseodymium trifluoride PrF3 and MF2 fluorides. The Doping of MF2 with RF3 leads to substitution of a M2+ ion by a R3+ ion. An extra F− is necessary for charge compensation, it occupies an interstitial position. Measurements on this type of materials have focused on their optical properties [6,9,10] and optical applications [11]. These compounds, known as “solid laser materials”, have the fluorite lattice structure for

                      [10]. Solid laser materials can be used in various applications such as laser spectroscopy [12], biotechnological sensing [13,14], temperature sensors [15–17] and quantum information processing [18–21] etc.
The present work is devoted to investigate the structural, electronic and optical properties of M1-xPrxF2+x (x = 0.25, M = Ca, Ba) using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method [22,23] within density functional theory [24] implemented in the WIEN2k code [21]. The electronic band structures are calculated in order to exploit them to study the optical properties of M1-xPrxF2+x (x = 0.25, M = Ca, Ba) materials and also to explain the role of f– states on these properties. We present calculations based on LSDA approximation and also on Coulomb-corrected LSDA + U approach to take into account the f-states. M1-xPrxF2+x (x = 0.25, M = Ca, Ba) crystallize in the cubic structure space group Pm-3m.
The paper is structured in four sections: the first one is devoted to the introduction. The calculation method is presented in the section 2. The results and their interpretations are reported in section 3. A conclusion is given at the end of this work in section 4.

Computational details:
In this study, the structural optimization, electronic and optical properties are performed by using the FP-LAPW method within the DFT + U formalism as implemented in WIEN2K package. For the structural properties, the local density approximation (LDA) proposed by Perdew and Zunger [25] has been used to estimate the exchange-correlation potential for the binary compounds CaF2 and BaF2. To describe the strong on-site coulomb interaction of 4f localized electrons in the strongly substituted compounds in Praseodymium Ca1-xPrxF2+x and Ba1-xPrxF2+x (x = 0.25), the LDA approach was used with the addition of Hubbard's term U. The parameter U can be extracted from ab-initio calculations, but usually it is obtained semi-empirically. In the present work, the Hubbard's U term (which takes into account the strong electronic correlation between the 4f orbitals of Pr) and the spin-polarized are introduced to study the electronic and optical properties for strongly substituted compounds in Praseodymium.
To represent the electronic wave's functions, plane waves with -6Ry as cut-off energy, were used. The RMT Kmax parameter, which controls the matrix size in the interstitial region, is chosen to be equal to 8, where RMT is a minimum Muffin-tin (MT) radius and Kmax is a maximum reciprocal lattice vector. Integrations of Brillouin zones were carried out by 7 × 7 × 7 Monkhorst-Pack [26] grid of k-point mesh. For the optical calculation, a dense mesh is required to take account of the weak transitions. 165 k-points are used for the doped fluorides.
For the LDA + U method, we use the scheme introduced by Anisimov et al. [22] with an approximate correction for the self-interaction correction (SIC). This application requires the introduction of two parameters: U which is the term of electronic correlation of Coulomb and J is the parameter which makes the interatomic average of exchange. For M1-xPrxF2+x (M = Ca, Ba) compounds we have used an effective Ueff = U −J, setting J = 0.07 and U = 0.44 (Ry) for Pr atom [27]. When the total energy difference of the crystal is less than 0.1 mRy, the self-consistent calculations are considered convergent. The valence configurations of atoms are.

3.1
                     Structural properties
                     Ground state structural parameters of CaF2 and BaF2 fluorides were calculated by fitting total energy versus cell volume for cubic structure. After obtaining the equilibrium structure, a supercell is constructed containing 13 atoms. The atomic positions as given as follows: Pr atom is in (0, 0, 0) while the three M atoms (M = Ca, Ba) are positioned at (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), (0, 1/2, 1/2). The F ions occupy the 8 tetrahedral sites at (1/4, 1/4, 1/4), (3/4, 1/4, 1/4), (1/4, 3/4, 1/4), (3/4, 3/4, 1/4), (1/4, 1/4, 3/4), (3/4, 1/4, 3/4), (1/4, 3/4, 3/4), (3/4, 3/4, 3/4). Since the substitution of a bivalent ion by a trivalent ion requires charge compensation, an interstitial ion Fi is placed in the center of the cube at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This atomic configuration leads to a 13 atoms in the supercell. Doping was then done by substituting Ca and Ba atoms with Praseodymium atoms. Fig. 1
                         shows a supercell containing the dopant within its lattice for the two compounds. The obtained values are fitted with the Murnaghan equation of state. The calculated lattice constant (a0), bulk modulus (B) and its pressure derivative (B’) for both binary compounds and their doped ternary alloys using standard LDA, are summarized in Table 1
                        .
                     By analyzing more carefully the reported results in Table 1, we can see that calculated LDA values for lattice constants are underestimated by 2.24% for CaF2 and 2.44% for BaF2 compared to the experimental ones [28,29].
                     We noted that these values are in good agreement with the theoretical ones calculated with the same approximations [30–32]. Moreover, the decrease in the bulk modulus from CaF2 to BaF2 means that the CaF2 compound is more rigid than the BaF2 compound.
3.2
                     Electronic properties
                     The knowledge of the ground state properties and the nature of the electronic states in the band formation allow us to understand the role of f-electrons. For this purpose, the calculation of the electronic structure with polarized spin based on LDA + U at high symmetry points were considered in the first Brillouin zone for the cubic structure. Figs. 2 and 3
                        
                         show the band structures for both spin up and spin down for the compounds Ba1-xPrxF2+xand Ca1-xPrxF2+x, respectively. The Fermi level is located at an energy equal to zero.
                     The band structures of M1-xPrxF2+x (M = Ba, Ca, x = 0.25) show that these compounds have a metallic behavior for spin up, while for spin down a semiconductor behavior is observed with an indirect band gap M-X equal to 3.21 eV for Ba1-xPrxF2+x and indirect band gap Γ-X equal to 2.77 eV for Ca1-xPrxF2+x. These values are smaller than those of binary compounds MF2. It is well known that the doping of fluorides (host matrix) with rare earth ions leads to band gap materials smaller than those of the host matrix. Indeed, the energy levels of rare earth ions are located in the forbidden band of the host matrix. It is found that the two fluorides BaF2 and CaF2 have band gaps equal to 6.95 and 7.14 eV [5], respectively.
                     In order to understand the electronic properties of doped Ba1-xPrxF2+x and Ca1-xPrxF2+x, we also calculate the projected density of states (DOS) using LDA + U as shown in Figs. 4 and 5
                        
                        . For both spins, in Ba1-xPrxF2+x, the calculations of DOS in valence bands, show that the Pr-f bands (with a small contribution) hybridize with the F-p, Ba-p and Ba-d states around −4.65 eV and in the spectral region [2.53–14.0] eV; it is also noticed that F-p hybridizes with Ba-p at 10.75 eV. We can see that the conduction band is dominated in the interval [2.50–10.20] eV by Pr-d and Ba-d states. In Ca1-xPrxF2+x, Pr-f states (with a small contribution) hybridizes with Pr-d, F-p and Ca-p states in the interval [-7.75 - 4.80] eV and with F-p and Pr-d bands around −2.0 eV. In the band conduction, in the range [2.50–14] eV Pr-f hybridizes with Pr-d and F-p states. We notice that Pr-d bands dominate this spectral region. The difference between both spins is seen in the conduction bands around the Fermi level EF. Indeed it is noticed that the Pr-f bands remain unhybridized. It is known that the Pr-f electrons are shielded by the 5s and 5p electrons, consequently the f states are much narrower than the other bands. For both compounds, the majority Pr-f bands are centered around the Fermi level while the minority Pr-f states have been shifted away from the EF level (1.55, 1.46 eV above EF for Ba1-xPrxF2+x and Ca1-xPrxF2+x respectively).
                     Consequently, as there is a difference in the DOS near the EF (metallic behavior for spin up and semiconductor for spin down), we can predict that our compounds are half-metals. The DOS for s states has not been plotted since their contribution is very small.

                     Optical properties
                     The present work focuses on the optical properties of the doped M0.75Pr0.25F2.25 fluorides (M = Ba, Ca), using both LSDA + U and LSDA calculations, by computing dielectric function ε(ω), absorption coefficient α(ω), refractive index n(ω), extinction coefficient K(ω), reflectivity R(ω) and energy loss L(ω), as shown in Figs. 6–11
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        .
                     
                        Fig. 6 shows the real part of the dielectric function ε1(ω) evolution in the energy range [0−40] eV for doped fluorides MxPr1−xF2+x (M = Ba, Ca, x = 0.25) using both approximations LSDA and LSDA + U. The curves are almost similar for low and high energies. However, a slight shift is reported when the energy increases. For Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25, the curves are almost similar in the limit of zero photon energy: ε1(0) = 3.05 (LSDA) and 3.04 (LSDA + U). However a slight shift is reported when the energy increases. For BaxPr1−xF2+x the effect of the U term is to shift the energy towards the short wavelengths. In fact, there is a difference in the behavior at low energy, very close to 0 eV; ε1(0) presents the value of 4.18 (LSDA) and 3.04 (LSDA + U). The calculated dielectric constant ε1(0) from LSDA is higher when compared to the DFT + U method. This is due to the f states which lie at the Fermi energy in LSDA. ε1(ω) increases with the incident photon energy to reach a maximum value at 3.26 eV (LSDA + U) and 0.42 eV (LSDA). After this, ε1(ω) decreases abruptly in the neighborhood of 10 eV. The same behavior is observed around 13 and 22 eV. This may be attributed to the high absorption in these spectral regions (Fig. 7).
                     The maximum peaks are located at 9.51 eV (LSDA + U) and 9.75 eV (LSDA) for Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25. In Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25, ε1(ω) is negative in the spectral ranges [19.83–20.26], [21.00–21.80], [22.62–25.60] eV by using the LSDA approximation, while the LSDA + U gives the values [12.9–14.65], [27.25–30.40] eV. For Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25, we found [12.9–14.52] and [27.00–30] eV with LSDA and [12.29–13.62] and [27.00–33.00] eV with LSDA + U. It is well known that when ε1(ω) is negative, electromagnetic waves cannot propagate and therefore the reflection coefficient is expected to reach a maximum value leading to a strong reflection in this spectral region [33]. Examining the reflectivity curve, R(ω) get actually a large reflectivity at these range energy.
                     In Table 2
                         we have listed the values of ε1(0) for both BaxPr1−xF2+x and CaxPr1−xF2+x. The calculated dielectric constant ε1(0) from LSDA are higher compared to the DFT + U method for Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25. To the best of our knowledge, there is no experimental or theoretical data of these compounds to compare with.
                     The absorption coefficient α(ω), the extinction coefficient K(ω), the refractive index n(ω), the reflectivity R(ω) and the energy loss for both Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 and Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25 alloys are shown in Figs. 7–11.
                     The absorption spectra were calculated for the compounds, as shown in Fig. 7, in the photon energy range [0−40] eV. As noted earlier, it appears that the Hubbard's term does not have a great effect on optical properties in Ca0.25Pr0.75F2.25: the curves are almost identical with a slight difference in the spectral range [20–27.5]. The highest peak is located at 27 eV.
                     For Ba0.25Pr0.75F2.25, we can clearly see the effect of Hubbard's term on the absorption spectrum. In fact the curves are shifted but have practically the same behavior. The important peak is positioned at 22.82 eV (LSDA) and at 27.3 eV (LSDA + U). In the spectral range [2–9] eV, we can see small additional peaks which could be attributed to Praseodymium.
                     The refractive index and extinction coefficient of Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 and Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25 are depicted in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. One can notice that for Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25, at the low energy, there is no difference in the calculated curves obtained by both approximations but there is a weak shifting towards higher energy. For Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25, the calculated static values n(0) with LSDA (2.04) are significantly higher than those obtained with LSDA + U (1.63). The values n(0) are given in Table 2.
                     The most important peaks of extinction coefficient are located at 22.95 eV and 27.68 eV for Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 and Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25, respectively for both approximations LSDA + U and LSDA.
                     The reflectivity is an important factor in many fields such as optics, radar, telecommunication, medicine, geophysics etc. The evolution of the reflectivity of the studied compounds is shown in Fig. 10(a) and (b). In Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25 the same behavior as the other optical magnitudes is observed for low energy. The prominent peak is located at 29 eV (LSDA) and at 28.5 eV (LSDA + U). In Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 the figure shows that the curves obtained with the two approximations have almost the same behavior for high energy. However, it may be noticed that there is a difference at low energy very close to zero. In fact from LSDA, one can see that R(ω) takes a value of 13% which is due to the f states which lie at the Fermi energy. From LSDA + U, R(ω) is equal to 6% indicating an insulating behavior and a transparent nature in the infrared, visible and ultra-violet ranges. From 5 eV, one can see that there is a rise in the calculated curves leading to the onset of interband transitions. The spectra are particularly well structured and divided of three structures in the ranges [5–15] [15–23] and [23–35] eV which show sharp peaks. In the last range, the prominent peak is located at 24.33 eV (65%) (LSDA) and at 23 eV (35%) (LSDA + U). It is important to note that the intensities obtained with LSDA are higher than those obtained with LSDA + U. This may be explained by the fact that la LSDA does not describe well the correlation between the localized electrons. It is interesting to note that the f states do not really influence the high energy spectra.
                     The energy loss spectrum of Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 and Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25 is presented in Fig. 11(a) and (b). In Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25 the main peaks, which are related to the plasma frequency, are found around 32.85 eV (LSDA + U) and two others which seem to be fused in a single peak around 31 eV. For Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25, the highest peak is located at 25.23 eV (LSDA + U) and around 25.86 eV (LSDA) which quite wide and less intense. Indeed these peaks occur when the real part of dielectric function is zero and the imaginary part has a minimum value [34].

Structural properties:
Ground state structural parameters of CaF2 and BaF2 fluorides were calculated by fitting total energy versus cell volume for cubic structure. After obtaining the equilibrium structure, a supercell is constructed containing 13 atoms. The atomic positions as given as follows: Pr atom is in (0, 0, 0) while the three M atoms (M = Ca, Ba) are positioned at (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), (0, 1/2, 1/2). The F ions occupy the 8 tetrahedral sites at (1/4, 1/4, 1/4), (3/4, 1/4, 1/4), (1/4, 3/4, 1/4), (3/4, 3/4, 1/4), (1/4, 1/4, 3/4), (3/4, 1/4, 3/4), (1/4, 3/4, 3/4), (3/4, 3/4, 3/4). Since the substitution of a bivalent ion by a trivalent ion requires charge compensation, an interstitial ion Fi is placed in the center of the cube at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This atomic configuration leads to a 13 atoms in the supercell. Doping was then done by substituting Ca and Ba atoms with Praseodymium atoms. Fig. 1
                         shows a supercell containing the dopant within its lattice for the two compounds. The obtained values are fitted with the Murnaghan equation of state. The calculated lattice constant (a0), bulk modulus (B) and its pressure derivative (B’) for both binary compounds and their doped ternary alloys using standard LDA, are summarized in Table 1
                        .
By analyzing more carefully the reported results in Table 1, we can see that calculated LDA values for lattice constants are underestimated by 2.24% for CaF2 and 2.44% for BaF2 compared to the experimental ones [28,29].
We noted that these values are in good agreement with the theoretical ones calculated with the same approximations [30–32]. Moreover, the decrease in the bulk modulus from CaF2 to BaF2 means that the CaF2 compound is more rigid than the BaF2 compound.

Electronic properties:
The knowledge of the ground state properties and the nature of the electronic states in the band formation allow us to understand the role of f-electrons. For this purpose, the calculation of the electronic structure with polarized spin based on LDA + U at high symmetry points were considered in the first Brillouin zone for the cubic structure. Figs. 2 and 3
                        
                         show the band structures for both spin up and spin down for the compounds Ba1-xPrxF2+xand Ca1-xPrxF2+x, respectively. The Fermi level is located at an energy equal to zero.
The band structures of M1-xPrxF2+x (M = Ba, Ca, x = 0.25) show that these compounds have a metallic behavior for spin up, while for spin down a semiconductor behavior is observed with an indirect band gap M-X equal to 3.21 eV for Ba1-xPrxF2+x and indirect band gap Γ-X equal to 2.77 eV for Ca1-xPrxF2+x. These values are smaller than those of binary compounds MF2. It is well known that the doping of fluorides (host matrix) with rare earth ions leads to band gap materials smaller than those of the host matrix. Indeed, the energy levels of rare earth ions are located in the forbidden band of the host matrix. It is found that the two fluorides BaF2 and CaF2 have band gaps equal to 6.95 and 7.14 eV [5], respectively.
In order to understand the electronic properties of doped Ba1-xPrxF2+x and Ca1-xPrxF2+x, we also calculate the projected density of states (DOS) using LDA + U as shown in Figs. 4 and 5
                        
                        . For both spins, in Ba1-xPrxF2+x, the calculations of DOS in valence bands, show that the Pr-f bands (with a small contribution) hybridize with the F-p, Ba-p and Ba-d states around −4.65 eV and in the spectral region [2.53–14.0] eV; it is also noticed that F-p hybridizes with Ba-p at 10.75 eV. We can see that the conduction band is dominated in the interval [2.50–10.20] eV by Pr-d and Ba-d states. In Ca1-xPrxF2+x, Pr-f states (with a small contribution) hybridizes with Pr-d, F-p and Ca-p states in the interval [-7.75 - 4.80] eV and with F-p and Pr-d bands around −2.0 eV. In the band conduction, in the range [2.50–14] eV Pr-f hybridizes with Pr-d and F-p states. We notice that Pr-d bands dominate this spectral region. The difference between both spins is seen in the conduction bands around the Fermi level EF. Indeed it is noticed that the Pr-f bands remain unhybridized. It is known that the Pr-f electrons are shielded by the 5s and 5p electrons, consequently the f states are much narrower than the other bands. For both compounds, the majority Pr-f bands are centered around the Fermi level while the minority Pr-f states have been shifted away from the EF level (1.55, 1.46 eV above EF for Ba1-xPrxF2+x and Ca1-xPrxF2+x respectively).
Consequently, as there is a difference in the DOS near the EF (metallic behavior for spin up and semiconductor for spin down), we can predict that our compounds are half-metals. The DOS for s states has not been plotted since their contribution is very small.

The curves are almost similar for low and high energies. However, a slight shift is reported when the energy increases. For Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25, the curves are almost similar in the limit of zero photon energy: ε1(0) = 3.05 (LSDA) and 3.04 (LSDA + U). However a slight shift is reported when the energy increases. For BaxPr1−xF2+x the effect of the U term is to shift the energy towards the short wavelengths. In fact, there is a difference in the behavior at low energy, very close to 0 eV; ε1(0) presents the value of 4.18 (LSDA) and 3.04 (LSDA + U). The calculated dielectric constant ε1(0) from LSDA is higher when compared to the DFT + U method. This is due to the f states which lie at the Fermi energy in LSDA. ε1(ω) increases with the incident photon energy to reach a maximum value at 3.26 eV (LSDA + U) and 0.42 eV (LSDA). After this, ε1(ω) decreases abruptly in the neighborhood of 10 eV. The same behavior is observed around 13 and 22 eV. This may be attributed to the high absorption in these spectral regions (Fig. 7).
The maximum peaks are located at 9.51 eV (LSDA + U) and 9.75 eV (LSDA) for Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25. In Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25, ε1(ω) is negative in the spectral ranges [19.83–20.26], [21.00–21.80], [22.62–25.60] eV by using the LSDA approximation, while the LSDA + U gives the values [12.9–14.65], [27.25–30.40] eV. For Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25, we found [12.9–14.52] and [27.00–30] eV with LSDA and [12.29–13.62] and [27.00–33.00] eV with LSDA + U. It is well known that when ε1(ω) is negative, electromagnetic waves cannot propagate and therefore the reflection coefficient is expected to reach a maximum value leading to a strong reflection in this spectral region [33]. Examining the reflectivity curve, R(ω) get actually a large reflectivity at these range energy.
In Table 2
                         we have listed the values of ε1(0) for both BaxPr1−xF2+x and CaxPr1−xF2+x. The calculated dielectric constant ε1(0) from LSDA are higher compared to the DFT + U method for Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25. To the best of our knowledge, there is no experimental or theoretical data of these compounds to compare with.
The absorption coefficient α(ω), the extinction coefficient K(ω), the refractive index n(ω), the reflectivity R(ω) and the energy loss for both Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 and Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25 alloys are shown in Figs. 7–11.
The absorption spectra were calculated for the compounds, as shown in Fig. 7, in the photon energy range [0−40] eV. As noted earlier, it appears that the Hubbard's term does not have a great effect on optical properties in Ca0.25Pr0.75F2.25: the curves are almost identical with a slight difference in the spectral range [20–27.5]. The highest peak is located at 27 eV.
For Ba0.25Pr0.75F2.25, we can clearly see the effect of Hubbard's term on the absorption spectrum. In fact the curves are shifted but have practically the same behavior. The important peak is positioned at 22.82 eV (LSDA) and at 27.3 eV (LSDA + U). In the spectral range [2–9] eV, we can see small additional peaks which could be attributed to Praseodymium.
The refractive index and extinction coefficient of Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 and Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25 are depicted in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. One can notice that for Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25, at the low energy, there is no difference in the calculated curves obtained by both approximations but there is a weak shifting towards higher energy. For Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25, the calculated static values n(0) with LSDA (2.04) are significantly higher than those obtained with LSDA + U (1.63). The values n(0) are given in Table 2.
The most important peaks of extinction coefficient are located at 22.95 eV and 27.68 eV for Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 and Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25, respectively for both approximations LSDA + U and LSDA.
The reflectivity is an important factor in many fields such as optics, radar, telecommunication, medicine, geophysics etc. The evolution of the reflectivity of the studied compounds is shown in Fig. 10(a) and (b). In Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25 the same behavior as the other optical magnitudes is observed for low energy. The prominent peak is located at 29 eV (LSDA) and at 28.5 eV (LSDA + U). In Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 the figure shows that the curves obtained with the two approximations have almost the same behavior for high energy. However, it may be noticed that there is a difference at low energy very close to zero. In fact from LSDA, one can see that R(ω) takes a value of 13% which is due to the f states which lie at the Fermi energy. From LSDA + U, R(ω) is equal to 6% indicating an insulating behavior and a transparent nature in the infrared, visible and ultra-violet ranges. From 5 eV, one can see that there is a rise in the calculated curves leading to the onset of interband transitions. The spectra are particularly well structured and divided of three structures in the ranges [5–15] [15–23] and [23–35] eV which show sharp peaks. In the last range, the prominent peak is located at 24.33 eV (65%) (LSDA) and at 23 eV (35%) (LSDA + U). It is important to note that the intensities obtained with LSDA are higher than those obtained with LSDA + U. This may be explained by the fact that la LSDA does not describe well the correlation between the localized electrons. It is interesting to note that the f states do not really influence the high energy spectra.
The energy loss spectrum of Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 and Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25 is presented in Fig. 11(a) and (b). In Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25 the main peaks, which are related to the plasma frequency, are found around 32.85 eV (LSDA + U) and two others which seem to be fused in a single peak around 31 eV. For Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25, the highest peak is located at 25.23 eV (LSDA + U) and around 25.86 eV (LSDA) which quite wide and less intense. Indeed these peaks occur when the real part of dielectric function is zero and the imaginary part has a minimum value [34].

Conclusion:
In this work, the structural, electronic and optical properties of the cubic fluorides Praseodymium doped BaF2 and CaF2 are reported using spin polarized full potential calculations using LSDA and LSDA + U approximations.
The structural parameters obtained in the level of LDA approximation are in reasonable agreement with the experimental and theoretical findings for binary compounds. For the doped fluorides (x = 0.25), the values are close to the experimental results.
The application of LDA + U has corrected the electronic description of the rare earth atom in the considered compounds. It is found that, due to the existence of 4f electrons of Praseodymium, the compounds M0.75Pr0.25F2.25 (M = Ba,Ca) are predicted as half-metallic. Optical properties such as the dielectric function ε(ω) and properties derived from it were also calculated using LDA + U and LDA approximations in the energy range [0−40] eV.
For Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25, we found that there is a no difference between the results for LSDA and LSDA + U at low energies however, a shift is observed for the high energies. In Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25, there is a clear difference between the two approximations in the whole spectral region and particularly in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet region of spectrum. These results indicate that the LSDA is not suitable for describing systems with strongly correlated electrons.
The study of these properties shows that the doped fluorides M0.75Pr0.25F2.25 (M = Ba, Ca) are transparent in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet wavelength bands.
Our predicted results for M0.75Pr0.25F2.25 (M = Ba, Ca) must be confirmed by future experimental and theoretical studies.

Body:
Praseodymium belongs to the lanthanide family, it has two f electrons. These electrons are highly localized and are responsible for electronic, magnetic and optical properties. The Pr3+ ion has a particular interest for the realization of solid laser materials in the visible range thanks to its energy levels diagram which presents multicolor transitions in red, orange, green and blue interval. One of the characteristics of praseodymium is that its visible transitions come from the 3P0 level or the levels just below 3P1 and 1I6 which have the advantage for pumping and miniaturization because one can only use a pumping source to obtain several wavelengths. The most important application of the Pr3+targeted is the miniature video projection [1,2]; an application which requires compact and efficient laser sources operating in red, green and blue (RGB).

The fluorides MF2 (M = Sr, Ba, Ca, Cd) are characterized by a high transparency in a large energy range. They have been widely investigated theoretically and experimentally [3–5] due to their wide band gap making them good host matrices for rare earth ions leading to the solid solutions M1-xRxF2+x [6–8]. These compounds are obtained by mixing in stoichiometric proportion Praseodymium trifluoride PrF3 and MF2 fluorides. The Doping of MF2 with RF3 leads to substitution of a M2+ ion by a R3+ ion. An extra F− is necessary for charge compensation, it occupies an interstitial position. Measurements on this type of materials have focused on their optical properties [6,9,10] and optical applications [11]. These compounds, known as “solid laser materials”, have the fluorite lattice structure for

                      [10]. Solid laser materials can be used in various applications such as laser spectroscopy [12], biotechnological sensing [13,14], temperature sensors [15–17] and quantum information processing [18–21] etc.

The present work is devoted to investigate the structural, electronic and optical properties of M1-xPrxF2+x (x = 0.25, M = Ca, Ba) using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method [22,23] within density functional theory [24] implemented in the WIEN2k code [21]. The electronic band structures are calculated in order to exploit them to study the optical properties of M1-xPrxF2+x (x = 0.25, M = Ca, Ba) materials and also to explain the role of f– states on these properties. We present calculations based on LSDA approximation and also on Coulomb-corrected LSDA + U approach to take into account the f-states. M1-xPrxF2+x (x = 0.25, M = Ca, Ba) crystallize in the cubic structure space group Pm-3m.

The paper is structured in four sections: the first one is devoted to the introduction. The calculation method is presented in the section 2. The results and their interpretations are reported in section 3. A conclusion is given at the end of this work in section 4.

In this study, the structural optimization, electronic and optical properties are performed by using the FP-LAPW method within the DFT + U formalism as implemented in WIEN2K package. For the structural properties, the local density approximation (LDA) proposed by Perdew and Zunger [25] has been used to estimate the exchange-correlation potential for the binary compounds CaF2 and BaF2. To describe the strong on-site coulomb interaction of 4f localized electrons in the strongly substituted compounds in Praseodymium Ca1-xPrxF2+x and Ba1-xPrxF2+x (x = 0.25), the LDA approach was used with the addition of Hubbard's term U. The parameter U can be extracted from ab-initio calculations, but usually it is obtained semi-empirically. In the present work, the Hubbard's U term (which takes into account the strong electronic correlation between the 4f orbitals of Pr) and the spin-polarized are introduced to study the electronic and optical properties for strongly substituted compounds in Praseodymium.

To represent the electronic wave's functions, plane waves with -6Ry as cut-off energy, were used. The RMT Kmax parameter, which controls the matrix size in the interstitial region, is chosen to be equal to 8, where RMT is a minimum Muffin-tin (MT) radius and Kmax is a maximum reciprocal lattice vector. Integrations of Brillouin zones were carried out by 7 × 7 × 7 Monkhorst-Pack [26] grid of k-point mesh. For the optical calculation, a dense mesh is required to take account of the weak transitions. 165 k-points are used for the doped fluorides.

For the LDA + U method, we use the scheme introduced by Anisimov et al. [22] with an approximate correction for the self-interaction correction (SIC). This application requires the introduction of two parameters: U which is the term of electronic correlation of Coulomb and J is the parameter which makes the interatomic average of exchange. For M1-xPrxF2+x (M = Ca, Ba) compounds we have used an effective Ueff = U −J, setting J = 0.07 and U = 0.44 (Ry) for Pr atom [27]. When the total energy difference of the crystal is less than 0.1 mRy, the self-consistent calculations are considered convergent. The valence configurations of atoms are.

Pr: 4f3 5s2 5p6 6s2, Ca: 3s2 3p6 4s2, Ba: 5s2 5p6 6s2 and F: 2s2 2p5.

Ground state structural parameters of CaF2 and BaF2 fluorides were calculated by fitting total energy versus cell volume for cubic structure. After obtaining the equilibrium structure, a supercell is constructed containing 13 atoms. The atomic positions as given as follows: Pr atom is in (0, 0, 0) while the three M atoms (M = Ca, Ba) are positioned at (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), (0, 1/2, 1/2). The F ions occupy the 8 tetrahedral sites at (1/4, 1/4, 1/4), (3/4, 1/4, 1/4), (1/4, 3/4, 1/4), (3/4, 3/4, 1/4), (1/4, 1/4, 3/4), (3/4, 1/4, 3/4), (1/4, 3/4, 3/4), (3/4, 3/4, 3/4). Since the substitution of a bivalent ion by a trivalent ion requires charge compensation, an interstitial ion Fi is placed in the center of the cube at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This atomic configuration leads to a 13 atoms in the supercell. Doping was then done by substituting Ca and Ba atoms with Praseodymium atoms. Fig. 1
                         shows a supercell containing the dopant within its lattice for the two compounds. The obtained values are fitted with the Murnaghan equation of state. The calculated lattice constant (a0), bulk modulus (B) and its pressure derivative (B’) for both binary compounds and their doped ternary alloys using standard LDA, are summarized in Table 1
                        .

By analyzing more carefully the reported results in Table 1, we can see that calculated LDA values for lattice constants are underestimated by 2.24% for CaF2 and 2.44% for BaF2 compared to the experimental ones [28,29].

We noted that these values are in good agreement with the theoretical ones calculated with the same approximations [30–32]. Moreover, the decrease in the bulk modulus from CaF2 to BaF2 means that the CaF2 compound is more rigid than the BaF2 compound.

The knowledge of the ground state properties and the nature of the electronic states in the band formation allow us to understand the role of f-electrons. For this purpose, the calculation of the electronic structure with polarized spin based on LDA + U at high symmetry points were considered in the first Brillouin zone for the cubic structure. Figs. 2 and 3
                        
                         show the band structures for both spin up and spin down for the compounds Ba1-xPrxF2+xand Ca1-xPrxF2+x, respectively. The Fermi level is located at an energy equal to zero.

The band structures of M1-xPrxF2+x (M = Ba, Ca, x = 0.25) show that these compounds have a metallic behavior for spin up, while for spin down a semiconductor behavior is observed with an indirect band gap M-X equal to 3.21 eV for Ba1-xPrxF2+x and indirect band gap Γ-X equal to 2.77 eV for Ca1-xPrxF2+x. These values are smaller than those of binary compounds MF2. It is well known that the doping of fluorides (host matrix) with rare earth ions leads to band gap materials smaller than those of the host matrix. Indeed, the energy levels of rare earth ions are located in the forbidden band of the host matrix. It is found that the two fluorides BaF2 and CaF2 have band gaps equal to 6.95 and 7.14 eV [5], respectively.

In order to understand the electronic properties of doped Ba1-xPrxF2+x and Ca1-xPrxF2+x, we also calculate the projected density of states (DOS) using LDA + U as shown in Figs. 4 and 5
                        
                        . For both spins, in Ba1-xPrxF2+x, the calculations of DOS in valence bands, show that the Pr-f bands (with a small contribution) hybridize with the F-p, Ba-p and Ba-d states around −4.65 eV and in the spectral region [2.53–14.0] eV; it is also noticed that F-p hybridizes with Ba-p at 10.75 eV. We can see that the conduction band is dominated in the interval [2.50–10.20] eV by Pr-d and Ba-d states. In Ca1-xPrxF2+x, Pr-f states (with a small contribution) hybridizes with Pr-d, F-p and Ca-p states in the interval [-7.75 - 4.80] eV and with F-p and Pr-d bands around −2.0 eV. In the band conduction, in the range [2.50–14] eV Pr-f hybridizes with Pr-d and F-p states. We notice that Pr-d bands dominate this spectral region. The difference between both spins is seen in the conduction bands around the Fermi level EF. Indeed it is noticed that the Pr-f bands remain unhybridized. It is known that the Pr-f electrons are shielded by the 5s and 5p electrons, consequently the f states are much narrower than the other bands. For both compounds, the majority Pr-f bands are centered around the Fermi level while the minority Pr-f states have been shifted away from the EF level (1.55, 1.46 eV above EF for Ba1-xPrxF2+x and Ca1-xPrxF2+x respectively).

Consequently, as there is a difference in the DOS near the EF (metallic behavior for spin up and semiconductor for spin down), we can predict that our compounds are half-metals. The DOS for s states has not been plotted since their contribution is very small.

The present work focuses on the optical properties of the doped M0.75Pr0.25F2.25 fluorides (M = Ba, Ca), using both LSDA + U and LSDA calculations, by computing dielectric function ε(ω), absorption coefficient α(ω), refractive index n(ω), extinction coefficient K(ω), reflectivity R(ω) and energy loss L(ω), as shown in Figs. 6–11
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        .

Fig. 6 shows the real part of the dielectric function ε1(ω) evolution in the energy range [0−40] eV for doped fluorides MxPr1−xF2+x (M = Ba, Ca, x = 0.25) using both approximations LSDA and LSDA + U. The curves are almost similar for low and high energies. However, a slight shift is reported when the energy increases. For Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25, the curves are almost similar in the limit of zero photon energy: ε1(0) = 3.05 (LSDA) and 3.04 (LSDA + U). However a slight shift is reported when the energy increases. For BaxPr1−xF2+x the effect of the U term is to shift the energy towards the short wavelengths. In fact, there is a difference in the behavior at low energy, very close to 0 eV; ε1(0) presents the value of 4.18 (LSDA) and 3.04 (LSDA + U). The calculated dielectric constant ε1(0) from LSDA is higher when compared to the DFT + U method. This is due to the f states which lie at the Fermi energy in LSDA. ε1(ω) increases with the incident photon energy to reach a maximum value at 3.26 eV (LSDA + U) and 0.42 eV (LSDA). After this, ε1(ω) decreases abruptly in the neighborhood of 10 eV. The same behavior is observed around 13 and 22 eV. This may be attributed to the high absorption in these spectral regions (Fig. 7).

The maximum peaks are located at 9.51 eV (LSDA + U) and 9.75 eV (LSDA) for Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25. In Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25, ε1(ω) is negative in the spectral ranges [19.83–20.26], [21.00–21.80], [22.62–25.60] eV by using the LSDA approximation, while the LSDA + U gives the values [12.9–14.65], [27.25–30.40] eV. For Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25, we found [12.9–14.52] and [27.00–30] eV with LSDA and [12.29–13.62] and [27.00–33.00] eV with LSDA + U. It is well known that when ε1(ω) is negative, electromagnetic waves cannot propagate and therefore the reflection coefficient is expected to reach a maximum value leading to a strong reflection in this spectral region [33]. Examining the reflectivity curve, R(ω) get actually a large reflectivity at these range energy.

In Table 2
                         we have listed the values of ε1(0) for both BaxPr1−xF2+x and CaxPr1−xF2+x. The calculated dielectric constant ε1(0) from LSDA are higher compared to the DFT + U method for Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25. To the best of our knowledge, there is no experimental or theoretical data of these compounds to compare with.

The absorption coefficient α(ω), the extinction coefficient K(ω), the refractive index n(ω), the reflectivity R(ω) and the energy loss for both Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 and Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25 alloys are shown in Figs. 7–11.

The absorption spectra were calculated for the compounds, as shown in Fig. 7, in the photon energy range [0−40] eV. As noted earlier, it appears that the Hubbard's term does not have a great effect on optical properties in Ca0.25Pr0.75F2.25: the curves are almost identical with a slight difference in the spectral range [20–27.5].

The important peak is positioned at 22.82 eV (LSDA) and at 27.3 eV (LSDA + U). In the spectral range [2–9] eV, we can see small additional peaks which could be attributed to Praseodymium.

The refractive index and extinction coefficient of Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 and Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25 are depicted in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. One can notice that for Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25, at the low energy, there is no difference in the calculated curves obtained by both approximations but there is a weak shifting towards higher energy. For Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25, the calculated static values n(0) with LSDA (2.04) are significantly higher than those obtained with LSDA + U (1.63). The values n(0) are given in Table 2.

It is important to note that the intensities obtained with LSDA are higher than those obtained with LSDA + U. This may be explained by the fact that la LSDA does not describe well the correlation between the localized electrons.

The energy loss spectrum of Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25 and Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25 is presented in Fig. 11(a) and (b).

In this work, the structural, electronic and optical properties of the cubic fluorides Praseodymium doped BaF2 and CaF2 are reported using spin polarized full potential calculations using LSDA and LSDA + U approximations.

The structural parameters obtained in the level of LDA approximation are in reasonable agreement with the experimental and theoretical findings for binary compounds. For the doped fluorides (x = 0.25), the values are close to the experimental results.

The application of LDA + U has corrected the electronic description of the rare earth atom in the considered compounds. It is found that, due to the existence of 4f electrons of Praseodymium, the compounds M0.75Pr0.25F2.25 (M = Ba,Ca) are predicted as half-metallic. Optical properties such as the dielectric function ε(ω) and properties derived from it were also calculated using LDA + U and LDA approximations in the energy range [0−40] eV.

For Ca0.75Pr0.25F2.25, we found that there is a no difference between the results for LSDA and LSDA + U at low energies however, a shift is observed for the high energies. In Ba0.75Pr0.25F2.25, there is a clear difference between the two approximations in the whole spectral region and particularly in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet region of spectrum. These results indicate that the LSDA is not suitable for describing systems with strongly correlated electrons.

The study of these properties shows that the doped fluorides M0.75Pr0.25F2.25 (M = Ba, Ca) are transparent in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet wavelength bands.

Our predicted results for M0.75Pr0.25F2.25 (M = Ba, Ca) must be confirmed by future experimental and theoretical studies.

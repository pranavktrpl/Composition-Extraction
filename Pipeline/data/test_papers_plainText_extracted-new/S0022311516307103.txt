Title:
Density-functional study of plutonium monoxide monohydride

Abstract:
The structural, electronic, mechanical, optical, thermodynamic properties of plutonium monoxide monohydride (PuOH) are studied by density-functional calculations within the framework of LDA/GGA and LDA/GGA+U. From the total energy calculation, the lowest-energy crystal structure of PuOH is predicted to have space group

                     -PuOH is in good agreement with the experimental value and the corresponding ground state is predicted to be an antiferromagnetic charge-transfer insulator. Furthermore, we investigate the bonding character of PuOH by analyzing the electron structure and find that there are a stronger Pu-O bond and a weaker Pu-H bond. The mechanical properties including the elastic constants, elastic moduli and Debye's temperature, and the optical properties including the reflectivity and absorption coefficient are also calculated. We then compute the phonon spectrum which verified the dynamical stability of

Introduction:
Plutonium (Pu) is a material with very unusual physical and chemical properties. It is the most complex metal in the periodic table with as many as six established phases under ambient pressure conditions [1]. Moreover, the corrosion of plutonium [2,3], which is extremely important for Pu's handling and storage, is also distinct from that of the other active metals. The protective layer of dioxide (PuO2) on the surface is unable to limit the corrosion of this metal and unexpected phenomena, such as pyrophoricity and moisture-accelerated rapid corrosion, were observed. Now the overall corrosion behavior of plutonium is believed to be contributed or catalyzed by the reactive compounds such as plutonium hydrides and sesquioxide.
So far most of the research has focused on plutonium oxides [4–18] and hydrides [8,19–24], and ignored the other reactive compound such as plutonium monoxide monohydride (PuOH). PuOH is a potentially reactive compound formed by corrosion of Pu in liquid water or moisture at room temperature [25–28]. In particular, PuOH is considered to initiate the rapid hydride-catalyzed corrosion of PuOH-coated plutonium metals [3,29], and identified as a key product to understand the chloride-catalyzed corrosion of plutonium in glovebox atmospheres [30].

                     describes the formation of PuOH in near-neutral water and also determines the composition of the product from experimental data showing that 0.5 mol of H2 is formed by the reaction of 1.0 mol of Pu. The identification of PuOH is also based on the thermal gravity (TG), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses [26]. From the XRD analysis, PuOH has a CaF2-related structure formed by a cationic sublattice of Pu (III) and an anionic sublattice of O2− and H−. However, the specific arrangement of O and H atoms is unknown, which may be ascribed to the small scattering cross section of these light atoms with respect to the heavy Pu atom. This structural uncertainty has impeded in-depth understanding and further exploration of PuOH.
Moreover, there are very limited experimental reports of the basic properties of PuOH, which may be attributed to the difficulties in preparing and handling samples. Besides the above-mentioned partially-determined structure, only the thermodynamic properties about the formation enthalpies of PuOH, the reactions of PuOH and PuOH-coated Pu with O2 are estimated [29]. In fact, density-functional study has already been performed to deeply understand the basic properties of plutonium metal, oxides and hydrides [10–24,31]. Therefore it is interesting and necessary to perform the density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate the ground state properties of PuOH, including the prediction of the Wyckoff positions of O and H. To our best knowledge, only References [32,33] listed the calculated lattice parameter, bulk modulus, and enthalpy of formation of PuOH with the crystal structure being unspecified.
In this work, we have predicted the ground state crystal structure from the perspective of the energetic stability, and systematically calculate the electronic, optical, mechanical and thermodynamic properties of PuOH. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The computational details are described in section 2, and the results are presented and discussed in section 3. Section 4 presents a brief summary.

                      Monkhorst-Pack k point sampling mesh [39] of Brillouin zone is used.
In order to capture the localization effect of the f electrons coming from the strong electron-electron interaction, we employed the so-called DFT+U approach which has been successfully applied to δ-plutonium [31], plutonium oxides [10–18] and hydrides [19–24]. Here we choose the rotationally invariant DFT+U scheme introduced by Liechtenstein et al. [40], which was already adopted in the study of Pu [31] and PuO2 
                     [11]. Unless otherwise stated, the typical set of parameters: U = 4.0 eV and J = 0.7 eV, are chosen in the following.
At last we must emphasis that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is not included in this work. Because Pu is a heavy metal element, SOC is expected to be important for the physics of plutonium compounds. However, in the case of PuO2, the inclusion of SOC has little effect on the bulk and one-electron properties [9,12]. For PuOH, our test calculations within LDA+U approaches, inclusion of SOC will increase the equilibrium lattice parameter by only 0.14% and the bulk modulus by only 2 GPa. Therefore SOC is neglected in the following.

                     As concerns the fluorite-related structures of PuOH, Pu occupied the positions in a face-centered cubic (fcc) configuration while O or H occupied the eight tetrahedral sites of the fcc lattice. In order to consider all the possible arrangements, one can randomly select four tetrahedral sites to accommodate the H atoms and the residual tetrahedral sites for the O atoms. After symmetry analyses, one can found that there are only six inequivalent atomic configurations, which are shown in Fig. 1
                        . The space groups include

                     Total energies for the six possible fluorite-related structures of PuOH are calculated within density functional theory as a function of lattice constant. For each space group, the total energies are obtained using three magnetic orders (NM, AFM, and FM) and only the lowest one of the three is presented. In Fig. 2
                        , the total energies for all phases are plotted as a function of volume. Here and in the following the values of energy and volume are presented per formula unit. Notice first that our calculation shows that the

                         for LDA/GGA+U. Recalling of the above analogy of the structure with the O-H mixture, we realized that the system is more stable for lower degree of segregation. The statement might be universal for various Pu + O + H systems, which signifies that the stability of the system may be achieved for the homogeneous O-H mixture and hydrogen transport may be rapid for the low-oxygen system.

                         are obtained by fitting the energy-volume data with the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state (EOS) fitting [41]. The EOS fitting also yields the equilibrium volume

                         and bulk modulus B as follows. Similar to the study of PuO2 and PuH2 
                        [10,11,19], the Hubbard U correction in the LDA/GGA+U approach leads to an increase of the equilibrium lattice parameter.
                     Both the pure LDA and GGA underestimated the lattice parameter of FM and AFM PuOH, as clearly shown in Fig. 3 (b). At a typical value of

                         eV, result of AFM phase within the LDA+U formalism (5.409 Å) is in close agreement with the experimental value (5.401 Å). In addition, since the distance between the neighboring Pu atoms of PuOH is almost the same as that of PuO2, the localized degree of 5f electrons in PuOH is similar to that in PuO2. Then we argue that DFT+U approach is more appropriate to describe the properties of PuOH than pure DFT. Therefore it is suitable for us to focus on the results obtained from LDA+U with

                        [11].

                         in the framework of LDA/GGA and LDA/GGA+U. The previous theoretical results [32,33] are also shown. A good agreement is obtained for the lattice parameter but for the bulk modulus and the later formation of enthalpies in Table 3, our results differ from these studies. These discrepancies may come from the unspecified crystal structure used in Refs. [32,33]. Clearly, our calculations predicted that PuOH is an AFM insulator, which is similar to PuO2.
                     It is interesting to compare the structure properties of PuOH with that of PuO2 
                        [11] and PuH2 
                        [23] with the same fluorite-related structure. It is intuitive to regard that there is a monotonic evolution along PuO2 
                        
                           →
                         PuOH 
                           →
                         PuH2. So it is with the bulk modulus B and energy gap 
                           Δ
                        . But for the lattice parameter, the value of PuOH in the LDA/GGA+U formalism is greater than that of PuO2 (5.338/5.444 Å [11]) and PuH2 (5.337/5.418 Å [23]). Actually, the experimental values for these compounds have already confirmed this point, although the difference is much smaller. In order to understand this non-monotonic evolution, it is necessary to discuss the corresponding electronic structure in section 3.4.

                     Mechanical properties
                     The mechanical properties, by which we understand the behavior of materials under external forces, are of special importance in fabrication processes and applications. The mechanical properties of a crystal are described by considering this crystal as a homogeneous continuum medium, i.e., an elastic body, rather than a periodic array of atoms. For an elastic body, the Hooke's law holds and the corresponding elastic properties are totally determined by the elastic tensor, which is the coefficient that relates the stress to the strain. In our work, the elastic tensor is also derived from the strain-stress relationship [42] by performing finite distortions of the lattice and also allowing the internal relaxation of the ions. For the elastic tensor of a cubic crystal, there are only three independent elastic constants, i.e.,

                     For polycrystal, the mechanical properties are evaluated by the elastic moduli, including bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, Young's modulus E, and Possion's ratio ν, which are the measure of the compressibility, rigidity, stiffness, and Possion's effect, respectively. The polycrystalline elastic moduli could be calculated by employing the Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation [43]. In this approach, the effective moduli are approximated by the arithmetic mean of the two well-known bounds for monocrystals according to Voigt [44] and Reuss and Agnew [45]. For a cubic system, the mathematical formulation is provided in the following equations [43]:

                     In Debye's theory [46,47], the solid was also treated as the elastic body, and the lattice vibrations are regarded as the elastic waves. In order to impose a finite number of modes in the solid, Debye used a maximum allowed frequency

                     Moreover, let us note that the Hubbard U correction in the LDA/GGA+U approach leads to a decrease of the elastic constants and elastic moduli. It could be understood from the increasing compressibility of the system with the lattice parameter being increased. So was the case of PuO2 
                        [12]. Next let us compare the mechanical properties of PuOH with that of PuO2 
                        [12] with the same fluorite-related structure. Take the results from LDA+U framework as an example (

                         of PuOH is almost the same as that of PuO2. This signifies that PuOH is sensitive to compress strain and insensitive to shear strain compare to PuO2. This point is also confirmed by comparing the values of elastic moduli.

                     Electronic structure
                     The vast array of electrical, optical, and magnetic properties of the material are determined by the electronic structure. In Fig. 4
                         we plot the total density of states (DOS) as well as the projected DOS for the Pu 5f, Pu 6d, O 2p, H 1s orbitals of PuOH within the LDA and LDA+U formalisms. Results from GGA and GGA+U are similar and hence are not shown here. Obviously, the ground state of

                        -PuOH is predicted to be metallic for the pure LDA and insulating for LDA+U, which is similar to PuO2 
                        [10–12]. Based on the ubiquitous localized nature of 5f electron in Pu compound and the above discussion in section 3.2, we conclude that PuOH is an antiferromagnetic insulator with space group

                        . Note that there is no experimental evidence about the insulating nature of PuOH from the available literature.
                     Now let us discuss the origin of the magnetic order in this system [49]. First, let us note that there is a huge degeneracy near the Fermi level for pure LDA, i.e., a large DOS in the Fermi level. From the Stoner model, the exchange interaction would split the energy of states with different spins and then polarized the states near the Fermi level, i.e., FM order. While for DFT+U, one can derive an effective AFM Heisenberg model from the strongly correlated Hubbard model at half-filling. This AFM exchange interaction may lead to the AFM order in this system.
                     From the partial DOS (pDOS),

                        -PuOH is predicted to be a charge-transfer insulator from the pDOS in Fig. 4. This behavior is similar to PuO2 
                        [50,51], but not Pu2 O3 which has the same formal charge with PuOH. Below the Fermi level, the shape of O-

                         pDOS, especially for the peak around −2 eV. These indicate the probable presence of Pu-O covalent bond. In order to clarify the bonding character in PuOH, we present in Fig. 5
                         the charge-density distribution of (110) plane calculated in LDA+U formalism. For one Pu atom, there are two nearest-neighboring H atoms and two nearest-neighboring O atoms in one (110) plane, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The charge density distribution around O and H atoms are nearly circular with slight deformation toward Pu atoms. And the charge density distribution around Pu atom is significantly deformed toward O atoms, forming a square-like shape due to the Td point group of 4a Wyckoff position. The covalent bridges between Pu and O atoms are clear and there are also visible bridges between Pu and H atoms. Thus we draw the conclusion that the Pu-O bond is stronger than the Pu-H bond in this system. Since there is a blank area between H and O atoms and their distance is as large as 2.7 Å (

                        ), we can deduce that there is no H-O bond in this system and PuOH is not an alkali. This conclusion agrees with the experimental observation that PuOH is insoluble in near-neutral water [28].
                     To understand the ionicity of PuOH, we carry out the Bader's charge analysis [52] and the results are listed in the bottom of Fig. 5. The charge value of O atom in PuOH is close to that in PuO2 (7.20 e) [12], and the charge value of H atom is close to that in PuH3 (1.50 e) [23]. These observations manifest that the formal charges of O and H could be regarded as O2− and H−, respectively. In addition, the charge of Pu atom in PuOH is lower than that in PuO2 (13.60 e) [12] but larger than that in PuH3 (14.58 e) [23], which indicates the lower valence state of Pu atom (Pu III). The results are consistent with the experimental argument [28].

                     Optical properties
                     Due to the radioactivity of plutonium compounds, contactless identification of various materials is very necessary, and obviously one of the useful tools is optical detection. Thus understanding the optical properties of PuOH is extremely important. Experimental data are not available now.
                     The optical properties as well as the electrical conductivity are determined by the frequency-dependent dielectric function

                     The reflectivity and absorption coefficients of PuOH are plotted in Fig. 6
                        . Due to the presence of AFM, the optical properties along the direction of the magnetic moment (x in our study) is slightly different from that perpendicular to the direction of magnetic moment (y and z in our study). The main difference lies in the first peak of

This transition also contributes to the rising of the absorption coefficients. Two main peaks are observed at 11.7 eV and 13 eV, which mainly contributed by the transition to higher energy levels.

                     Thermodynamical properties
                     All the above discussions are about zero-temperature, but the state of a physical system is usually relevant to the finite temperature T. From this perspective, it is of great importance to understand the thermodynamical properties of PuOH. Usually, the thermodynamical properties are easily measurable and for PuOH, some thermodynamical quantities are already estimated in Ref. [29].
                     Thermodynamic properties of crystals are mainly determined by lattice vibrations, i.e., the phonons. Using the PHONOPY code [57], the phonon frequencies are computed from the real-space force constants. And the force constants are calculated in the density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT) within the LDA+U scheme. In Fig. 7
                         we plot the phonon spectrum along K-
                           Γ
                        -X-

                        -L directions in the Brillouin Zone (BZ) and also the phonon density of states (PDOS). In the spectrum, there are totally nine phonon modes attributed to the three atoms in the primitive cell. Due to the mass difference among Pu, O, and H atoms, Pu atoms contribute the lowest acoustic phonon bands (0–5 THz), followed by O atoms (9–12 THz), and finally H atoms (29–32 THz).
                     The thermodynamic quantities at the equilibrium volume 
                           
                              V

                         could be calculated directly by using the above phonon frequencies, while the determination of the quantities at constant pressure P should be combined within the quasiharmonic approximations in which the harmonic approximation holds for every value of V. Now the calculated phonon frequency

                         300 K, and then become slower. And the bulk modulus decreases approximately linearly as the temperature is increased.

                         are the total energies of α-Pu2 O3, PuO2, and fcc-PuH3 compounds using the same scheme, respectively. In Table 3, we list these results and also the experimental values for comparison.
                     Within LDA, formation energy deviates from the experiment by 2% while for the LDA+U calculation, the difference increase up to 7%. For the GGA calculation,

                         deviates from the experiment by 4% while within GGA+U, the difference decrease to 3%. The larger formation energies found in LDA with respect to GGA are coherent with the overbinding usually found in LDA. For the same reason, the reaction of oxidation of PuOH and PuOH+Pu is more exothermic in LDA(+U) than in GGA(+U). All these differences are reasonable and therefore we deduce that our calculation are reliable and consistent.

Crystal structure:
As concerns the fluorite-related structures of PuOH, Pu occupied the positions in a face-centered cubic (fcc) configuration while O or H occupied the eight tetrahedral sites of the fcc lattice. In order to consider all the possible arrangements, one can randomly select four tetrahedral sites to accommodate the H atoms and the residual tetrahedral sites for the O atoms. After symmetry analyses, one can found that there are only six inequivalent atomic configurations, which are shown in Fig. 1
                        . The space groups include

Total energies for the six possible fluorite-related structures of PuOH are calculated within density functional theory as a function of lattice constant. For each space group, the total energies are obtained using three magnetic orders (NM, AFM, and FM) and only the lowest one of the three is presented. In Fig. 2
                        , the total energies for all phases are plotted as a function of volume. Here and in the following the values of energy and volume are presented per formula unit. Notice first that our calculation shows that the

                         for LDA/GGA+U. Recalling of the above analogy of the structure with the O-H mixture, we realized that the system is more stable for lower degree of segregation. The statement might be universal for various Pu + O + H systems, which signifies that the stability of the system may be achieved for the homogeneous O-H mixture and hydrogen transport may be rapid for the low-oxygen system.

                        . In Fig. 3 (b) we plot the dependence of 
                           
                              
                                 a
                                 0

                         are obtained by fitting the energy-volume data with the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state (EOS) fitting [41]. The EOS fitting also yields the equilibrium volume

                         and bulk modulus B as follows. Similar to the study of PuO2 and PuH2 
                        [10,11,19], the Hubbard U correction in the LDA/GGA+U approach leads to an increase of the equilibrium lattice parameter.
Both the pure LDA and GGA underestimated the lattice parameter of FM and AFM PuOH, as clearly shown in Fig. 3 (b). At a typical value of 
                           
                              U
                              =
                              4
                           
                         eV, result of AFM phase within the LDA+U formalism (5.409 Å) is in close agreement with the experimental value (5.401 Å). In addition, since the distance between the neighboring Pu atoms of PuOH is almost the same as that of PuO2, the localized degree of 5f electrons in PuOH is similar to that in PuO2. Then we argue that DFT+U approach is more appropriate to describe the properties of PuOH than pure DFT. Therefore it is suitable for us to focus on the results obtained from LDA+U with 
                           
                              U
                              =
                              4.0
                           
                         eV, which we assumed to be the reference value for PuOH and also chosen in the study of Pu [31] and PuO2 
                        [11].

                         in the framework of LDA/GGA and LDA/GGA+U. The previous theoretical results [32,33] are also shown. A good agreement is obtained for the lattice parameter but for the bulk modulus and the later formation of enthalpies in Table 3, our results differ from these studies. These discrepancies may come from the unspecified crystal structure used in Refs. [32,33]. Clearly, our calculations predicted that PuOH is an AFM insulator, which is similar to PuO2.
It is interesting to compare the structure properties of PuOH with that of PuO2 
                        [11] and PuH2 
                        [23] with the same fluorite-related structure. It is intuitive to regard that there is a monotonic evolution along PuO2 
                        
                           →
                         PuOH 
                           →
                         PuH2. So it is with the bulk modulus B and energy gap 
                           Δ
                        . But for the lattice parameter, the value of PuOH in the LDA/GGA+U formalism is greater than that of PuO2 (5.338/5.444 Å [11]) and PuH2 (5.337/5.418 Å [23]). Actually, the experimental values for these compounds have already confirmed this point, although the difference is much smaller. In order to understand this non-monotonic evolution, it is necessary to discuss the corresponding electronic structure in section 3.4.

Mechanical properties:
The mechanical properties, by which we understand the behavior of materials under external forces, are of special importance in fabrication processes and applications. The mechanical properties of a crystal are described by considering this crystal as a homogeneous continuum medium, i.e., an elastic body, rather than a periodic array of atoms. For an elastic body, the Hooke's law holds and the corresponding elastic properties are totally determined by the elastic tensor, which is the coefficient that relates the stress to the strain. In our work, the elastic tensor is also derived from the strain-stress relationship [42] by performing finite distortions of the lattice and also allowing the internal relaxation of the ions. For the elastic tensor of a cubic crystal, there are only three independent elastic constants, i.e.,

For polycrystal, the mechanical properties are evaluated by the elastic moduli, including bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, Young's modulus E, and Possion's ratio ν, which are the measure of the compressibility, rigidity, stiffness, and Possion's effect, respectively. The polycrystalline elastic moduli could be calculated by employing the Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation [43]. In this approach, the effective moduli are approximated by the arithmetic mean of the two well-known bounds for monocrystals according to Voigt [44] and Reuss and Agnew [45]. For a cubic system, the mathematical formulation is provided in the following equations [43]:

In Debye's theory [46,47], the solid was also treated as the elastic body, and the lattice vibrations are regarded as the elastic waves. In order to impose a finite number of modes in the solid, Debye used a maximum allowed frequency

Moreover, let us note that the Hubbard U correction in the LDA/GGA+U approach leads to a decrease of the elastic constants and elastic moduli. It could be understood from the increasing compressibility of the system with the lattice parameter being increased. So was the case of PuO2 
                        [12]. Next let us compare the mechanical properties of PuOH with that of PuO2

Electronic structure:
The vast array of electrical, optical, and magnetic properties of the material are determined by the electronic structure. In Fig. 4

                        -PuOH is predicted to be metallic for the pure LDA and insulating for LDA+U, which is similar to PuO2 
                        [10–12]. Based on the ubiquitous localized nature of 5f electron in Pu compound and the above discussion in section 3.2, we conclude that PuOH is an antiferromagnetic insulator with space group

                        . Note that there is no experimental evidence about the insulating nature of PuOH from the available literature.
Now let us discuss the origin of the magnetic order in this system [49]. First, let us note that there is a huge degeneracy near the Fermi level for pure LDA, i.e., a large DOS in the Fermi level. From the Stoner model, the exchange interaction would split the energy of states with different spins and then polarized the states near the Fermi level, i.e., FM order. While for DFT+U, one can derive an effective AFM Heisenberg model from the strongly correlated Hubbard model at half-filling. This AFM exchange interaction may lead to the AFM order in this system.
From the partial DOS (pDOS),

                        -PuOH is predicted to be a charge-transfer insulator from the pDOS in Fig. 4. This behavior is similar to PuO2 
                        [50,51], but not Pu2 O3 which has the same formal charge with PuOH. Below the Fermi level, the shape of O-

                         pDOS, especially for the peak around −2 eV. These indicate the probable presence of Pu-O covalent bond. In order to clarify the bonding character in PuOH, we present in Fig. 5
                         the charge-density distribution of (110) plane calculated in LDA+U formalism. For one Pu atom, there are two nearest-neighboring H atoms and two nearest-neighboring O atoms in one (110) plane, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The charge density distribution around O and H atoms are nearly circular with slight deformation toward Pu atoms. And the charge density distribution around Pu atom is significantly deformed toward O atoms, forming a square-like shape due to the Td point group of 4a Wyckoff position. The covalent bridges between Pu and O atoms are clear and there are also visible bridges between Pu and H atoms. Thus we draw the conclusion that the Pu-O bond is stronger than the Pu-H bond in this system. Since there is a blank area between H and O atoms and their distance is as large as 2.7 Å (

                        ), we can deduce that there is no H-O bond in this system and PuOH is not an alkali. This conclusion agrees with the experimental observation that PuOH is insoluble in near-neutral water [28].
To understand the ionicity of PuOH, we carry out the Bader's charge analysis [52] and the results are listed in the bottom of Fig. 5. The charge value of O atom in PuOH is close to that in PuO2 (7.20 e) [12], and the charge value of H atom is close to that in PuH3 (1.50 e) [23]. These observations manifest that the formal charges of O and H could be regarded as O2− and H−, respectively. In addition, the charge of Pu atom in PuOH is lower than that in PuO2 (13.60 e) [12] but larger than that in PuH3 (14.58 e) [23], which indicates the lower valence state of Pu atom (Pu III). The results are consistent with the experimental argument [28].

Optical properties:
Due to the radioactivity of plutonium compounds, contactless identification of various materials is very necessary, and obviously one of the useful tools is optical detection. Thus understanding the optical properties of PuOH is extremely important. Experimental data are not available now.
The optical properties as well as the electrical conductivity are determined by the frequency-dependent dielectric function

The reflectivity and absorption coefficients of PuOH are plotted in Fig. 6
                        . Due to the presence of AFM, the optical properties along the direction of the magnetic moment (x in our study) is slightly different from that perpendicular to the direction of magnetic moment (y and z in our study). The main difference lies in the first peak of

                         in Fig. 6 (a) at 1.6 eV, which is contributed by the transition from the top of valence bands to the bottom of conduction bands in Fig. 4. This transition also contributes to the rising of the absorption coefficients. Two main peaks are observed at 11.7 eV and 13 eV, which mainly contributed by the transition to higher energy levels.

Thermodynamical properties:
All the above discussions are about zero-temperature, but the state of a physical system is usually relevant to the finite temperature T. From this perspective, it is of great importance to understand the thermodynamical properties of PuOH. Usually, the thermodynamical properties are easily measurable and for PuOH, some thermodynamical quantities are already estimated in Ref. [29].
Thermodynamic properties of crystals are mainly determined by lattice vibrations, i.e., the phonons. Using the PHONOPY code [57], the phonon frequencies are computed from the real-space force constants. And the force constants are calculated in the density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT) within the LDA+U scheme. In Fig. 7
                         we plot the phonon spectrum along K-
                           Γ
                        -X-
                           Γ
                        -L directions in the Brillouin Zone (BZ) and also the phonon density of states (PDOS). In the spectrum, there are totally nine phonon modes attributed to the three atoms in the primitive cell. Due to the mass difference among Pu, O, and H atoms, Pu atoms contribute the lowest acoustic phonon bands (0–5 THz), followed by O atoms (9–12 THz), and finally H atoms (29–32 THz).
The thermodynamic quantities at the equilibrium volume

                         could be calculated directly by using the above phonon frequencies, while the determination of the quantities at constant pressure P should be combined within the quasiharmonic approximations in which the harmonic approximation holds for every value of V. Now the calculated phonon frequency

Within LDA, formation energy deviates from the experiment by 2% while for the LDA+U calculation, the difference increase up to 7%. For the GGA calculation,

                         deviates from the experiment by 4% while within GGA+U, the difference decrease to 3%. The larger formation energies found in LDA with respect to GGA are coherent with the overbinding usually found in LDA. For the same reason, the reaction of oxidation of PuOH and PuOH+Pu is more exothermic in LDA(+U) than in GGA(+U). All these differences are reasonable and therefore we deduce that our calculation are reliable and consistent.

Summary:
In this work, we systematically investigate the structural, mechanical, electronic, optical and thermodynamical properties of PuOH within the framework of density functional theory. The strong local correlation of f electrons in this compound is taken into account by employing the DFT+U scheme. Firstly, the crystal structure of PuOH, which is experimentally ambiguous, is identified by the total energy calculation. PuOH is predicted to have space group

                     -PuOH are calculated and the lattice parameter within the LDA+U formalism is in good agreement with the experimental value. The mechanical properties such as elastic constants, elastic moduli and Debye's temperature are also computed.
Furthermore, the electronic structures of PuOH are analyzed to reveal the bonding character. It is found that there is a stronger Pu-O bond and a weaker Pu-H bond. Bader's charge analysis illustrate the Pu(III) cationic feature, which agrees with the experimental arguments. The optical properties of PuOH including the reflectivity and absorption coefficient are calculated and might be useful to the contactless identification of this compound.
In the last part, the thermodynamical properties of PuOH are presented. Firstly the phonon spectrum and density of states are given and confirm the dynamical stability of

Body:
Plutonium (Pu) is a material with very unusual physical and chemical properties. It is the most complex metal in the periodic table with as many as six established phases under ambient pressure conditions [1]. Moreover, the corrosion of plutonium [2,3], which is extremely important for Pu's handling and storage, is also distinct from that of the other active metals. The protective layer of dioxide (PuO2) on the surface is unable to limit the corrosion of this metal and unexpected phenomena, such as pyrophoricity and moisture-accelerated rapid corrosion, were observed. Now the overall corrosion behavior of plutonium is believed to be contributed or catalyzed by the reactive compounds such as plutonium hydrides and sesquioxide.

So far most of the research has focused on plutonium oxides [4–18] and hydrides [8,19–24], and ignored the other reactive compound such as plutonium monoxide monohydride (PuOH). PuOH is a potentially reactive compound formed by corrosion of Pu in liquid water or moisture at room temperature [25–28]. In particular, PuOH is considered to initiate the rapid hydride-catalyzed corrosion of PuOH-coated plutonium metals [3,29], and identified as a key product to understand the chloride-catalyzed corrosion of plutonium in glovebox atmospheres [30].

                     describes the formation of PuOH in near-neutral water and also determines the composition of the product from experimental data showing that 0.5 mol of H2 is formed by the reaction of 1.0 mol of Pu. The identification of PuOH is also based on the thermal gravity (TG), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses [26]. From the XRD analysis, PuOH has a CaF2-related structure formed by a cationic sublattice of Pu (III) and an anionic sublattice of O2− and H−. However, the specific arrangement of O and H atoms is unknown, which may be ascribed to the small scattering cross section of these light atoms with respect to the heavy Pu atom. This structural uncertainty has impeded in-depth understanding and further exploration of PuOH.

Moreover, there are very limited experimental reports of the basic properties of PuOH, which may be attributed to the difficulties in preparing and handling samples. Besides the above-mentioned partially-determined structure, only the thermodynamic properties about the formation enthalpies of PuOH, the reactions of PuOH and PuOH-coated Pu with O2 are estimated [29]. In fact, density-functional study has already been performed to deeply understand the basic properties of plutonium metal, oxides and hydrides [10–24,31]. Therefore it is interesting and necessary to perform the density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate the ground state properties of PuOH, including the prediction of the Wyckoff positions of O and H. To our best knowledge, only References [32,33] listed the calculated lattice parameter, bulk modulus, and enthalpy of formation of PuOH with the crystal structure being unspecified.

In this work, we have predicted the ground state crystal structure from the perspective of the energetic stability, and systematically calculate the electronic, optical, mechanical and thermodynamic properties of PuOH. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The computational details are described in section 2, and the results are presented and discussed in section 3. Section 4 presents a brief summary.

This study was performed using the VASP code [34]. The projector augmented wave (PAW) [35,36] pseudopotentials for Pu, O, and H with the

For the exchange and correlation energy, both the local density approximation (LDA) [37] and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using Perdew-Becke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [38] functional are employed. In addition, we also studied three possibilities for the magnetic states: nonmagnetic (NM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), and ferromagnetic (FM). The kinetic energy cutoff is taken as 700 eV and an

                      Monkhorst-Pack k point sampling mesh [39] of Brillouin zone is used.

In order to capture the localization effect of the f electrons coming from the strong electron-electron interaction, we employed the so-called DFT+U approach which has been successfully applied to δ-plutonium [31], plutonium oxides [10–18] and hydrides [19–24]. Here we choose the rotationally invariant DFT+U scheme introduced by Liechtenstein et al. [40], which was already adopted in the study of Pu [31] and PuO2 
                     [11]. Unless otherwise stated, the typical set of parameters: U = 4.0 eV and J = 0.7 eV, are chosen in the following.

At last we must emphasis that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is not included in this work. Because Pu is a heavy metal element, SOC is expected to be important for the physics of plutonium compounds. However, in the case of PuO2, the inclusion of SOC has little effect on the bulk and one-electron properties [9,12]. For PuOH, our test calculations within LDA+U approaches, inclusion of SOC will increase the equilibrium lattice parameter by only 0.14% and the bulk modulus by only 2 GPa. Therefore SOC is neglected in the following.

As concerns the fluorite-related structures of PuOH, Pu occupied the positions in a face-centered cubic (fcc) configuration while O or H occupied the eight tetrahedral sites of the fcc lattice. In order to consider all the possible arrangements, one can randomly select four tetrahedral sites to accommodate the H atoms and the residual tetrahedral sites for the O atoms. After symmetry analyses, one can found that there are only six inequivalent atomic configurations, which are shown in Fig. 1
                        . The space groups include

Total energies for the six possible fluorite-related structures of PuOH are calculated within density functional theory as a function of lattice constant. For each space group, the total energies are obtained using three magnetic orders (NM, AFM, and FM) and only the lowest one of the three is presented. In Fig. 2
                        , the total energies for all phases are plotted as a function of volume. Here and in the following the values of energy and volume are presented per formula unit. Notice first that our calculation shows that the

Besides, all the relative energies of the other phases are greater than 81 meV (equivalent to 940 K), which implies that PuOH would only adopt the space group

                         for LDA/GGA+U. Recalling of the above analogy of the structure with the O-H mixture, we realized that the system is more stable for lower degree of segregation. The statement might be universal for various Pu + O + H systems, which signifies that the stability of the system may be achieved for the homogeneous O-H mixture and hydrogen transport may be rapid for the low-oxygen system.

The magnetic states predicted by our LDA/GGA calculation is FM while that from the LDA/GGA+U calculation is AFM. To display the FM-AFM transition, we show in Fig. 3

Now let us focus on the lattice parameter

                        . In Fig. 3 (b) we plot the dependence of 
                           
                              
                                 a
                                 0

                                 0
                              
                           
                         are obtained by fitting the energy-volume data with the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state (EOS) fitting [41]. The EOS fitting also yields the equilibrium volume 
                           
                              
                                 V
                                 0
                              
                           
                         and bulk modulus B as follows. Similar to the study of PuO2 and PuH2 
                        [10,11,19], the Hubbard U correction in the LDA/GGA+U approach leads to an increase of the equilibrium lattice parameter.

Both the pure LDA and GGA underestimated the lattice parameter of FM and AFM PuOH, as clearly shown in Fig. 3 (b). At a typical value of 
                           
                              U
                              =
                              4
                           
                         eV, result of AFM phase within the LDA+U formalism (5.409 Å) is in close agreement with the experimental value (5.401 Å). In addition, since the distance between the neighboring Pu atoms of PuOH is almost the same as that of PuO2, the localized degree of 5f electrons in PuOH is similar to that in PuO2. Then we argue that DFT+U approach is more appropriate to describe the properties of PuOH than pure DFT. Therefore it is suitable for us to focus on the results obtained from LDA+U with 
                           
                              U
                              =
                              4.0
                           
                         eV, which we assumed to be the reference value for PuOH and also chosen in the study of Pu [31] and PuO2 
                        [11].

                         in the framework of LDA/GGA and LDA/GGA+U. The previous theoretical results [32,33] are also shown. A good agreement is obtained for the lattice parameter but for the bulk modulus and the later formation of enthalpies in Table 3, our results differ from these studies. These discrepancies may come from the unspecified crystal structure used in Refs. [32,33]. Clearly, our calculations predicted that PuOH is an AFM insulator, which is similar to PuO2.

It is interesting to compare the structure properties of PuOH with that of PuO2 
                        [11] and PuH2 
                        [23] with the same fluorite-related structure. It is intuitive to regard that there is a monotonic evolution along PuO2 
                        
                           →
                         PuOH 
                           →
                         PuH2. So it is with the bulk modulus B and energy gap 
                           Δ
                        . But for the lattice parameter, the value of PuOH in the LDA/GGA+U formalism is greater than that of PuO2 (5.338/5.444 Å [11]) and PuH2 (5.337/5.418 Å [23]). Actually, the experimental values for these compounds have already confirmed this point, although the difference is much smaller. In order to understand this non-monotonic evolution, it is necessary to discuss the corresponding electronic structure in section 3.4.

The mechanical properties, by which we understand the behavior of materials under external forces, are of special importance in fabrication processes and applications. The mechanical properties of a crystal are described by considering this crystal as a homogeneous continuum medium, i.e., an elastic body, rather than a periodic array of atoms. For an elastic body, the Hooke's law holds and the corresponding elastic properties are totally determined by the elastic tensor, which is the coefficient that relates the stress to the strain. In our work, the elastic tensor is also derived from the strain-stress relationship [42] by performing finite distortions of the lattice and also allowing the internal relaxation of the ions. For the elastic tensor of a cubic crystal, there are only three independent elastic constants, i.e.,

For polycrystal, the mechanical properties are evaluated by the elastic moduli, including bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, Young's modulus E, and Possion's ratio ν, which are the measure of the compressibility, rigidity, stiffness, and Possion's effect, respectively. The polycrystalline elastic moduli could be calculated by employing the Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation [43]. In this approach, the effective moduli are approximated by the arithmetic mean of the two well-known bounds for monocrystals according to Voigt [44] and Reuss and Agnew [45]. For a cubic system, the mathematical formulation is provided in the following equations [43]:

In Debye's theory [46,47], the solid was also treated as the elastic body, and the lattice vibrations are regarded as the elastic waves. In order to impose a finite number of modes in the solid, Debye used a maximum allowed frequency

                        , i.e., the frequency of the highest normal mode of vibration. The corresponding temperature is the so-called Debye temperature,

Let us focus on the mechanical stability first. For cubic crystals, the stability criteria requires that

                         phase of PuOH is mechanically stable.

Moreover, let us note that the Hubbard U correction in the LDA/GGA+U approach leads to a decrease of the elastic constants and elastic moduli. It could be understood from the increasing compressibility of the system with the lattice parameter being increased. So was the case of PuO2 
                        [12]. Next let us compare the mechanical properties of PuOH with that of PuO2 
                        [12] with the same fluorite-related structure. Take the results from LDA+U framework as an example (

                         of PuOH is almost the same as that of PuO2. This signifies that PuOH is sensitive to compress strain and insensitive to shear strain compare to PuO2. This point is also confirmed by comparing the values of elastic moduli.

The vast array of electrical, optical, and magnetic properties of the material are determined by the electronic structure. In Fig. 4
                         we plot the total density of states (DOS) as well as the projected DOS for the Pu 5f, Pu 6d, O 2p, H 1s orbitals of PuOH within the LDA and LDA+U formalisms. Results from GGA and GGA+U are similar and hence are not shown here. Obviously, the ground state of

                        -PuOH is predicted to be metallic for the pure LDA and insulating for LDA+U, which is similar to PuO2 
                        [10–12]. Based on the ubiquitous localized nature of 5f electron in Pu compound and the above discussion in section 3.2, we conclude that PuOH is an antiferromagnetic insulator with space group

                        . Note that there is no experimental evidence about the insulating nature of PuOH from the available literature.

Now let us discuss the origin of the magnetic order in this system [49]. First, let us note that there is a huge degeneracy near the Fermi level for pure LDA, i.e., a large DOS in the Fermi level. From the Stoner model, the exchange interaction would split the energy of states with different spins and then polarized the states near the Fermi level, i.e., FM order. While for DFT+U, one can derive an effective AFM Heisenberg model from the strongly correlated Hubbard model at half-filling. This AFM exchange interaction may lead to the AFM order in this system.

From the partial DOS (pDOS),

                        -PuOH is predicted to be a charge-transfer insulator from the pDOS in Fig. 4. This behavior is similar to PuO2 
                        [50,51], but not Pu2 O3 which has the same formal charge with PuOH. Below the Fermi level, the shape of O-

                         pDOS, especially for the peak around −2 eV. These indicate the probable presence of Pu-O covalent bond. In order to clarify the bonding character in PuOH, we present in Fig. 5
                         the charge-density distribution of (110) plane calculated in LDA+U formalism. For one Pu atom, there are two nearest-neighboring H atoms and two nearest-neighboring O atoms in one (110) plane, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The charge density distribution around O and H atoms are nearly circular with slight deformation toward Pu atoms. And the charge density distribution around Pu atom is significantly deformed toward O atoms, forming a square-like shape due to the Td point group of 4a Wyckoff position. The covalent bridges between Pu and O atoms are clear and there are also visible bridges between Pu and H atoms. Thus we draw the conclusion that the Pu-O bond is stronger than the Pu-H bond in this system. Since there is a blank area between H and O atoms and their distance is as large as 2.7 Å (

                        ), we can deduce that there is no H-O bond in this system and PuOH is not an alkali. This conclusion agrees with the experimental observation that PuOH is insoluble in near-neutral water [28].

To understand the ionicity of PuOH, we carry out the Bader's charge analysis [52] and the results are listed in the bottom of Fig. 5. The charge value of O atom in PuOH is close to that in PuO2 (7.20 e) [12], and the charge value of H atom is close to that in PuH3 (1.50 e) [23]. These observations manifest that the formal charges of O and H could be regarded as O2− and H−, respectively. In addition, the charge of Pu atom in PuOH is lower than that in PuO2 (13.60 e) [12] but larger than that in PuH3 (14.58 e) [23], which indicates the lower valence state of Pu atom (Pu III). The results are consistent with the experimental argument [28].

Due to the radioactivity of plutonium compounds, contactless identification of various materials is very necessary, and obviously one of the useful tools is optical detection. Thus understanding the optical properties of PuOH is extremely important. Experimental data are not available now.

The optical properties as well as the electrical conductivity are determined by the frequency-dependent dielectric function

The reflectivity and absorption coefficients of PuOH are plotted in Fig. 6
                        . Due to the presence of AFM, the optical properties along the direction of the magnetic moment (x in our study) is slightly different from that perpendicular to the direction of magnetic moment (y and z in our study). The main difference lies in the first peak of

This transition also contributes to the rising of the absorption coefficients. Two main peaks are observed at 11.7 eV and 13 eV, which mainly contributed by the transition to higher energy levels.

                         is not far from the value obtained for PuO2 
                        [11,56].

All the above discussions are about zero-temperature, but the state of a physical system is usually relevant to the finite temperature T. From this perspective, it is of great importance to understand the thermodynamical properties of PuOH. Usually, the thermodynamical properties are easily measurable and for PuOH, some thermodynamical quantities are already estimated in Ref. [29].

Thermodynamic properties of crystals are mainly determined by lattice vibrations, i.e., the phonons. Using the PHONOPY code [57], the phonon frequencies are computed from the real-space force constants. And the force constants are calculated in the density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT) within the LDA+U scheme. In Fig. 7
                         we plot the phonon spectrum along K-

                        -L directions in the Brillouin Zone (BZ) and also the phonon density of states (PDOS). In the spectrum, there are totally nine phonon modes attributed to the three atoms in the primitive cell. Due to the mass difference among Pu, O, and H atoms, Pu atoms contribute the lowest acoustic phonon bands (0–5 THz), followed by O atoms (9–12 THz), and finally H atoms (29–32 THz).

The thermodynamic quantities at the equilibrium volume

                         could be calculated directly by using the above phonon frequencies, while the determination of the quantities at constant pressure P should be combined within the quasiharmonic approximations in which the harmonic approximation holds for every value of V. Now the calculated phonon frequency

                         300 K, and then become slower. And the bulk modulus decreases approximately linearly as the temperature is increased.

At last, we also compute the formation energies

                         are the total energies of α-Pu2 O3, PuO2, and fcc-PuH3 compounds using the same scheme, respectively. In Table 3, we list these results and also the experimental values for comparison.

Within LDA, formation energy deviates from the experiment by 2% while for the LDA+U calculation, the difference increase up to 7%. For the GGA calculation,

                         deviates from the experiment by 4% while within GGA+U, the difference decrease to 3%. The larger formation energies found in LDA with respect to GGA are coherent with the overbinding usually found in LDA. For the same reason, the reaction of oxidation of PuOH and PuOH+Pu is more exothermic in LDA(+U) than in GGA(+U). All these differences are reasonable and therefore we deduce that our calculation are reliable and consistent.

In this work, we systematically investigate the structural, mechanical, electronic, optical and thermodynamical properties of PuOH within the framework of density functional theory. The strong local correlation of f electrons in this compound is taken into account by employing the DFT+U scheme. Firstly, the crystal structure of PuOH, which is experimentally ambiguous, is identified by the total energy calculation. PuOH is predicted to have space group

                     -PuOH are calculated and the lattice parameter within the LDA+U formalism is in good agreement with the experimental value. The mechanical properties such as elastic constants, elastic moduli and Debye's temperature are also computed.

Furthermore, the electronic structures of PuOH are analyzed to reveal the bonding character. It is found that there is a stronger Pu-O bond and a weaker Pu-H bond. Bader's charge analysis illustrate the Pu(III) cationic feature, which agrees with the experimental arguments. The optical properties of PuOH including the reflectivity and absorption coefficient are calculated and might be useful to the contactless identification of this compound.

In the last part, the thermodynamical properties of PuOH are presented. Firstly the phonon spectrum and density of states are given and confirm the dynamical stability of

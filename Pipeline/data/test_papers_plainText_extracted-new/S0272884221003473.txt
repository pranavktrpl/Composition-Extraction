Title:
Phase  microstructure and related mechanical properties of a series of (NbTaZr)C-Based high entropy ceramics

Abstract:
The microstructure and a few mechanical-related properties of a series of multi-equiatomic-cation (NbTaZr)C-based carbides, namely (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrW)C, (ZrNbTaHf)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C, were assessed to shed light into understanding the role of composition. Dense, pure and homogeneous rock-salt structured ceramics are achievable for all four compositions through spark plasma sinntering at 2200 °C for 10 min. Neither the hardness nor the fracture toughness is determined solely by the number of cations; among the four high entropy ceramics, (NbTaZrW)C exhibits the best combination of hardness and fracture toughness. Electronic structure and lattice distortion differences can explain part of the property differences, such as the lowered Young's modulus of (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C compared to (NbTaZr)C; but certainly, more in-depth theoretical investigations are needed to provide a full understanding of the effects of W and/or Hf addition on the hardness and fracture toughness of (NbTaZr)C.

Introduction:
Existing ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) are essentially not able to satisfy the continuous development and advancement of a few sharp technologies, such as nuclear and aerospace applications. It is thus critical to design and discover new materials to meet the increasingly demanding and diverse performance requirements and to broaden the applications to previously unexplored and/or unexplorable areas. The emergence of the concept of high entropy ceramic (HEC) [1,2] indeed motivated and enabled researchers from the field of metallurgy to move one big step toward the design of new UTHCs. This “entropy stabilization [1–4]" strategy was borrowed and extended from the two-decades-old concept of “high entropy alloy [5–12]”. Different from conventional UTHCs (metal oxides, carbides, silicides, nitrides and diborides) in which the cation positions are occupied by a single type of metallic elements, HECs typically have multiple metallic elements randomly locating at their cation positions. Compositional complexities of HECs led to a number of surprising properties, such as ultra-high hardness [1–4,13–19], high fracture toughness [20–27], high thermal stability [28,29] and a broad and composition-dependent adjustable range of thermal conductivity [30,31].
A (NbTaZr)C carbide was reported as a type of face-centered cubic (FCC) single-phase carbide [32]. Demirskyi et al. [32] reported its flexural strength performance at rather high temperatures (1600–2000 °C). A few other researchers investigated HECs containing Nb, Ta and Zr cations with different focuses. Dusza et al. [33] confirmed the composition homogeneity at micro and nano/atomic level of a highly-pure and dense (NbTaZrHf)C carbide fabricated through ball milling the constituent carbides and spark plasma sintering (SPS). Properties including hardness (36.1 GPa) and Young's modulus (598 GPa) of this quaternary carbide was reported by Castle et al. [13] in which the SPS process was delicately optimized (2300 °C, 7min). By incorporating one more cation, the quinary (NbTaZrHfTi)C HEC was more extensively studied than any others. Gild et al. [34] proposed a reactive flash SPS method for rapid synthesis; Zhou et al. [28] observed improved oxide resistance and thermal stability of (NbTaZrHfTi)C HEC compared to its original components. Moskovskikh et al. [21] fabricated (NbTaZrHfTi)C HEC with 94.8% relative density using SPS (2000 °C, 10min) and reported its hardness (25.7 GPa), Young's modulus (473 GPa) and thermal conductivity (5.6 Wm−1K−1). In addition to dense materials, porous (NbTaZrHfTi)C HEC was fabricated by Chen et al. [22] with the hope of obtaining HECs with reasonable strength (3.39 MPa) and low thermal conductivity (0.51Wm−1K−1) for thermal barrier applications. Other studied quinanry NbTaZr-series HECs include (NbTaZrMoTi)C and (NbTaZrTiW)C. Wang et al. [23] fabricated (NbTaZrMoTi)C with 98.6% relative density through hot pressing (2100 °C, 30min) the carbides powders obtained from carbonthermal reduction of oxides and reported its hardness (31.3 GPa at 100 mN force); Wei et al. [35] compared the extent of densification of (NbTaZrTiW)C bulks obtained through three different SPS-based routes without reporting any property.
Most of the above studies reported properties for a single ceramic without identifying the role of composition. Moreover, the effects of composition on multi-cation carbides cannot be easily extracted from these studies. For example, we cannot identify the effects of HfC, TiC and WC on (NbTaZr)C and that of TiC on (NbTaZrHf)C through the property data compiled from related studies [13–18,23,25–27,32]. This was mainly caused by their lack of consistency in bulk fabrication methods (SPS, reactive SPS, or hot pressing), sintering condition (temperature and duration), as well as the resulted relative density. Differences in property evaluations (flexural strength, hardness at different load) also contributed to the difficulty in composition effect isolation. Understanding the cation-type effect is essentially valuable toward the establishment of universally applicable microstructure- and property-prediction criteria and/or model and thus toward the facilitation of novel advanced UTHC development. As a step toward filling this gap, we, in the present study, assessed the microstructure and a few mechanical-related properties of the (NbTaZr)C carbide and a few representative quaternary- and quinary-cation carbides compositionally based on it, namely (NbTaZrHf)C, (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C. In the current study, we kept all variables other than composition identical.

Experimental materials and methods:
The raw constituent powders, include TaC (~1.10 μm), ZrC (~1.35 μm), NbC (~1.20 μm), HfC (~1.10 μm), WC (~1.25 μm), were weighted and mixed in equiatomic proportions to obtain the (TaZrNb)C, (TaZrNbHf)C, (TaZrNbW)C and (TaZrNbHfW)C powder mixtures. The powder mixtures were ball milled at 250 rpm for 20 h in cemented carbide jar. The ball (cemented carbide, diameter: 5 mm) to powder mixture was 10:1. Before milling, the jar was filled with Ar gas. Subsequently, the powder mixture was sintered using SPS (LABOX-325 R Spark plasma sintering system, Japan); the sintering temperature was 2200 °C for 10min in vacuum, the pressure was maintained at 30 MPa during the sintering process.
Densities of the bulks were measured using the Archimedes’ method. The phase components and lattice parameters of the sintered parts were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Japan, Cu Kα, 40 kV, 40 mA, 5°/min, 30-80° range). Grain structure and micro-scale compositional homogeneity were visualized using scanning electron microscope (SEM, TESCAN MIRA3) operated in back-scattered electron (BSE) mode. Nano-scale elemental distribution was assessed using transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL F200). For SEM characterization, the specimens were ground to 1200 grit and polished using 0.02 μm colloidal silica; specimens for TEM were prepared using ion-milling method.
The nanohardness of the specimens were determined using a nanoindentation hardness tester (Nano indenter NanoTest Vantage); the maximum load for the tests were 50 mN with loading rate of 10 mN/s and the dwell time at the target load was 10s. The elastic modulus of the specimens were determined using an ultrasonic method. To this end, the surfaces of the sintered samples were well ground, followed by measurements of their thicknesses and time of flight with appropriate acoustic transducers, from which longitudinal and shear wave velocities were obtained. Assuming the materials are isotropic, their two independent elastic constants were calculated from the longitudinal and shear wave velocities using techniques described elsewhere [9,36].
Fracture toughness of this series of HECs was measured using the indentation technique. To achieve this, microhardness tests (SHIMADZU HMV-G-FA-S microhardness tester) were performed on their polished surfaces to obtain the values of microhardness and to generate cracks on the surfaces. A load of 9.8 N was used for this purpose. The radial crack length was measured from the center of the indent. For each specimen, 10 indentations were performed to obtained the average microhardness and crack length. From the measured elastic modulus, microhardness and crack length, the fracture toughness (KIc) of each material was calculated using the Antis equation [20,37].
To understand the experimental observations, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package [38,39]. Ion-electron interactions were described by projector augmented wave (PAW) approach [40]. The exchange-correlation interactions were modeled by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form [41]. The energy cutoff of plane waves was 600 eV. The considered HECs were modeled by a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of the rocksalt structure containing 64 atoms. A 5 × 5 × 5 k-point mesh based on the Monkhorst-Pack scheme was used. The convergence criteria for the total energy and atomic force were 10−4 eV and 10−2 eV/Å, respectively. The chemical disorder in the cation sublattice of HECs was modeled using special quasirandom structures (SQS) that were constructed by optimization of the Warren-Cowley short range order (SRO) parameters [42,43] with a Monte-Carlo simulated annealing algorithm [44]. The equilibrium lattice constant and bulk modulus was calculated by fitting the energy-volume relations to the Birch–Murnaghan (BM) equation of states [45]. Elastic constants of HECs were obtained by fitting the strain-energy relation with a series of strains applied to the cubic supercell of HECs (from −0.015 to +0.015). Three independent elastic constants, i.e., C11, C12, and C44 were calculated and other elastic parameters were deduced from the three constants.

                        m). Their single phase nature was further confirmed by the BSE images presented in Fig. 1b–e, in which equiaxed grained structures for all materials were seen. For (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrW)C, (NbTaZrHf)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C, their grain sizes calculated from the corresponding microstructures were 16, 9, 9, and 10 μm, respectively and their relative densities are 99.5%, 97.3%, 97.3% and 100%, respectively.
                     SEM-EDS mapping was performed on (NbTaZrHfW)C as a representative to visualize the microscale homogeneity of this series of HEC and the results were presented in Fig. 2
                        . It can be seen that, the five constituent metallic component (Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, and W) distribute homogeneously without any sign of elemental segregation at this scale. Atomic ratios of Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, and W quantified from the mapping were 6.6, 6.9, 6.7, 7.1, and 6.9, respectively. The great discrepancy between this composition and the designed composition arose mainly from the difficulty of SEM-EDS in accurately quantifying light elements like C. Despite this, it is clear that the five metallic components equiatomically shared the cations. A high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image was shown in Fig. 3
                        a for further structural verification and visualization of the homogeneity for (NbTaZrHfW)C at nano/atomic scale. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern for this material shows no sign of ordering and no additional spots, indicating the absence of secondary phases. Further, the STEM-EDS exhibits no indication of elemental clustering or phase segregation. The structural determination and composition homogeneity identification through our multi-scale characterizaiton (XRD, SEM, and TEM) supports the formation of high entropy single-phase ceramics.
                     The single phase nature of (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C is consistent with previous observations [13,32]. It is noted that the pure form of all NbC, TaC, ZrC and HfC has a FCC crystal structure and, moreover, the solubility [46] is complete between each of these carbides; thus the formation of (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C as pure rock-salt ceramics should not be a surprise. WC has a hexagonal structure; it is mostly soluble in NbC and TaC and only slightly soluble in ZrC and HfC [46]. So replacing original cations (NbTaZr or NbTaZrHf) with enough W would de-stablize the FCC structure and cause phase separations. The retaining of the pure FCC structure for (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C indicated that WC has at least 25 at.% and 20 at.% solubility in (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C, respectively. Further, to help understand the formation of pure FCC carbides, we calculated the size misfit parameter (δ) [6] for each composition in two different ways. First, δ was calculated based on the lattice constants of pure carbides (4.4691, 4.454, 4.683 and 4.641 Å for NbC, TaC, ZrC, and HfC, respectively [46]). Since WC is not a FCC ceramic, we can only calculate δ for (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C in this manner. The obtained values were 2.31% and 2.22%, respectively. Another way to quantity δ was based on the atomic sizes of single metallic cation. The Seitz radii [47] of Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf and W are 1.625, 1.626, 1.771, 1.743, and 1.549 Å, respectively. δ values of (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrW)C, (ZrNbTaHf)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C calculated in this way were 4.1%, 4.9%, 3.9% and 5.0%, respectively. It is clear that all of the investigated multi-cation ceramics, (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrW)C, (ZrNbTaHf)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C, satisfy the Hume-Rothery-based size misfit criteria, δ ≤ 6.6% [6]. So the formation of single phase for the current ceramics is understandable.
                     Lattice parameters (Table 1
                        ) calculated from the XRD patterns for (NbTaZr)C, (ZrNbTaHf)C, (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C were 4.5359, 4.5606, 4.4836, and 4.5187 Å, respectively. The value of (NbTaZr)C is consistent with literature (4.535 Å) [46]. For NbTaZr and ZrNbTaHf, we were able to compare their measured lattice constants with the rule-of-mixture (ROM) values. It is seen from Table 1 that the experiment and ROM values matched well. Lattice constants calculated using DFT were also listed in Table 1. Despite the fact that the calculated value is slightly higher than the corresponding experimental one, the general trend matched well. Replacing 25% ternary and 20% quaternary cations in (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C with W both induced the reduction of lattice constants. Replacing 25% ternary and 20% quaternary cations in (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrW)C with Hf both induced the increase of lattice constants. The atomic size of W [47] is the smallest among all five constituent metallic component and that of Hf [47] is greater than Nb and Ta. Thus, the lattice contraction by W addition and lattice expansion by Hf addition can be well reasoned.
3.2
                     Lattice distortion and electronic structure analysis
                     Since lattice distortion and electronic structure were recognized playing significant role in determining the mechanical-related properties of HECs, we provided corresponding analyses of this series of HECs in Table 2
                         and Fig. 4
                        , respectively. The local lattice distortion was calculated based on the obtained equilibrium structures following our previous methodology [48]. The radial displacements for each element are shown in Table 2. It is suggested that the HECs containing W ((NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C) exhibit more severe distortion than those without W ((NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C). The large distortion associated with W is attributed to its incompatible lattice with rock-salt structure since its ground states are not of the FCC type. Our previous results show that lattice distortion may soften HECs [48], suggesting that the two HECs containing W would exhibit lower modulus.
                     As for the electronic structure, in the considered HECs, only the cation elements are different. For these refractory transition metals, d states are the main contributors to the bonding interactions. Here we compare the calculated projected density of states (PDOS) for d states of transition metals and p states of C atoms in Fig. 4. The DOS for these carbides are similar, with bonding and antibonding states separated by a pseudogap around −2 to −1 eV. Based on the overlap of DOS among the metal elements and C, it is seen that hybridization of Nb–C and Ta–C is higher than Zr–C in (NbTaZr)C below the Fermi level (Ef), suggesting strong covalent bonding of these two bonds. Adding W to (NbTaZr)C leads to a significant increase of DOS at Ef, resulting in instability of (NbTaZrW)C. On the other hand, incorporating Hf into (NbTaZr)C induces a lowering of DOS at Ef and promote the hybridization of Nb–C and Ta–C. For (NbTaZrHfW)C, its bonding strength depends on the competition between the two contradictory effects from W and Hf and, theoretically, should fall between that of (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHf)C. Finally, one can also appreciate that the pseudogap of the two W-containing HECs is father away from Ef than the other two, suggesting, again, that their Young's modulus should be lower than that of (NbTaZr)C.
3.3
                     Mechanical-related properties
                     The Young's modulus of the four HECs measured using the ultrasonic method (E_ultrasonic) were listed in Table 1, in which those from DFT calculation (E_DFT) were also included. The differences between the experimental and calculated values are within 10%. In both cases, (NbTaZr)C has the lowest Young's modulus; and (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C exhibit lower Young's modulus compared to (NbTaZr)C. These observations are indeed consistent with the analysis based on their electronic structures as mentioned above. In spite of this, a consistent trend cannot be observed. For example, (NbTaZr)C has the highest experiment value while (NbTaZrHf)C presents the largest calculated value. There is no fixed values for the Young's modulus of the monocarbides. The reported range for NbC is 338–580 GPa; and that for TaC, ZrC, HfC, and WC are 285–560, 350–440, 350–510, and 620–720 GPa, respectively [46]. So, there is also a range of the ROM value (E_ROM, Table 1) for each multi-cation carbide. As shown in Table 1, both experiment and calculated values fall well in and close to the upper bound of the ROM values.
                     The nanohardness, microhardness, and fracture toughness of this series of carbides are listed in Table 3
                        . The nanohardness of the ternary- and quaternary-cation carbides ((NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrHf)C and (NbTaZrW)C) are higher than that of the quinary-cation carbide, (NbTaZrHfW)C. As for the microhardness, that of (ZrNbTaHf)C and (NbTaZrW)C are lower than that of the other two carbides. Differences in their relative density would contribute to the inconsistency between nanohardness and microhardness. The fracture toughness of (NbTaZr)C agrees well with the reported value (~2.9 MPa m1/2 [30]). Adding either Hf or W as cation enhanced the fracture toughness and the improvement by adding W is more pronounced. Among this series of HECs, (NbTaZrW)C possesses the highest fracture toughness (~4.02 MPa m1/2) and (NbTaZr)C exhibits the lowest (~3.07 MPa m1/2). These observations indicate that neither the hardness nor the fracture toughness of HECs depends solely on the number of cation; appropriate combination of cations should be selected for high-strength HEC design. In fact, similar conclusion has been drawn for high entropy alloys [49,50]. Overall, the (NbTaZrW)C exhibits the most promising combination of hardness and fracture toughness.
                     The nanohardness and fracture toughness of (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrHf)C, (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C were compared with that of the monocarbides in Fig. 5
                        . It is clear that the HECs exhibited enhanced hardness. This is indeed a general observation and was most-often attributed to the strong solid solution strengthening caused by the severe lattice distortion due to the compositional complexity [13–15,18–20,23]; the electronic mechanism was also reported as a possible contribution [18]. The fracture toughness of NbC, TaC, ZrC and HfC monocarbides were reported as 2.9 [20], 2.7 [14], 2.1 [20], and 2.9 MPa m1/2 [14], respectively. Thus, the fracture toughness of the HECs is also generally superior to that of the monocarbides. Ye et al. [14,20] suggested that the microcrack deflection toughening mechanism relating to the pullout of grain boundary-trapped irregular nanoplates would be one of the contributions toward the enhanced fracture toughness.
                     Although DFT calculations cannot provide direct calculations for hardness, some empirical methods are proposed to estimate the hardness of different materials based on some DFT outputs (such as bulk modulus). Using the empirical formula [51], we calculated and presented the hardness values of this series of carbides in Table 3. Even though the calculated results are generally lower than the experimental values, and the two sets of data does not exhibit exactly the same trend, both methods observed the hardness enhancement by incorporating Hf to (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrW)C. The beneficial effects of Hf to the hardnness is explainable through the above-mentioned electronic structure analysis which shows promoted hybridization and thus stronger bonding strength by incorporating Hf. Despite this, it is rather clear that there is not a single parameter (lattice distortion, hybridization) that correlates exactly well with the observed mechanical-related properties, including Young's modulus, nanohardness and fracture toughness. This raised the difficult in gaining mechanistic understanding of the observed differences which was most possibly the result of their synergistic effects. In HECs, their complexity in cation composition raised even more challenge to elucidate the mechanisms, since local environments may play important roles as they do in high entropy alloys [52,53]. For example, the fracture toughness depends on crack propagation under specific loading conditions and relies on a few parameters, such as the surface energy of the material, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio. For HECs, the surface energy will show large variations depending on the local compositions near the surface. In addition, a full understanding of the initiation and propagation of cracks also requires knowledge of the generalized stacking fault energy curves. Thus, more in-depth experimental and theoretical studies are certainly needed to provide solid understandings.
                     In Fig. 5, we also compiled the nanohardness (Fig. 5a) and fracture toughness (Fig. 5b) of other reported high entropy carbides [13,14,16–20,23–27,32], in which the load applied for the hardness tests were listed. We noted that the processing histories, relative densities, grain structures and other property-affecting factors as well as the test conditions (e.g., the applied load) of these carbides may not be consistent; but we still try to locate the properties of the current HECs in this bigger picture. Our first intuitive impression is that, the hardness of the current HECs are superior and their toughness are comparable to most reported high entropy carbides, including (NbTaZrTi)C, (NbTaMoVW)C, (NbZrTiV)C and (NbTaZrHfTi)C. Thus, the current set of HECs, especially the (NbTaZrW)C carbide, could serve as good starting compositions for future UTHC design through further cation doping and/or compositional tuning.

The structural determination and composition homogeneity identification through our multi-scale characterizaiton (XRD, SEM, and TEM) supports the formation of high entropy single-phase ceramics.
The single phase nature of (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C is consistent with previous observations [13,32]. It is noted that the pure form of all NbC, TaC, ZrC and HfC has a FCC crystal structure and, moreover, the solubility [46] is complete between each of these carbides; thus the formation of (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C as pure rock-salt ceramics should not be a surprise.

Further, to help understand the formation of pure FCC carbides, we calculated the size misfit parameter (δ) [6] for each composition in two different ways. First, δ was calculated based on the lattice constants of pure carbides (4.4691, 4.454, 4.683 and 4.641 Å for NbC, TaC, ZrC, and HfC, respectively [46]). Since WC is not a FCC ceramic, we can only calculate δ for (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C in this manner. The obtained values were 2.31% and 2.22%, respectively. Another way to quantity δ was based on the atomic sizes of single metallic cation. The Seitz radii [47] of Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf and W are 1.625, 1.626, 1.771, 1.743, and 1.549 Å, respectively. δ values of (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrW)C, (ZrNbTaHf)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C calculated in this way were 4.1%, 4.9%, 3.9% and 5.0%, respectively. It is clear that all of the investigated multi-cation ceramics, (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrW)C, (ZrNbTaHf)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C, satisfy the Hume-Rothery-based size misfit criteria, δ ≤ 6.6% [6]. So the formation of single phase for the current ceramics is understandable.
Lattice parameters (Table 1
                        ) calculated from the XRD patterns for (NbTaZr)C, (ZrNbTaHf)C, (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C were 4.5359, 4.5606, 4.4836, and 4.5187 Å, respectively. The value of (NbTaZr)C is consistent with literature (4.535 Å) [46]. For NbTaZr and ZrNbTaHf, we were able to compare their measured lattice constants with the rule-of-mixture (ROM) values. It is seen from Table 1 that the experiment and ROM values matched well. Lattice constants calculated using DFT were also listed in Table 1. Despite the fact that the calculated value is slightly higher than the corresponding experimental one, the general trend matched well. Replacing 25% ternary and 20% quaternary cations in (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C with W both induced the reduction of lattice constants. Replacing 25% ternary and 20% quaternary cations in (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrW)C with Hf both induced the increase of lattice constants. The atomic size of W [47] is the smallest among all five constituent metallic component and that of Hf [47] is greater than Nb and Ta. Thus, the lattice contraction by W addition and lattice expansion by Hf addition can be well reasoned.

Lattice distortion and electronic structure analysis:
Since lattice distortion and electronic structure were recognized playing significant role in determining the mechanical-related properties of HECs, we provided corresponding analyses of this series of HECs in Table 2
                         and Fig. 4
                        , respectively. The local lattice distortion was calculated based on the obtained equilibrium structures following our previous methodology [48]. The radial displacements for each element are shown in Table 2. It is suggested that the HECs containing W ((NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C) exhibit more severe distortion than those without W ((NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C). The large distortion associated with W is attributed to its incompatible lattice with rock-salt structure since its ground states are not of the FCC type. Our previous results show that lattice distortion may soften HECs [48], suggesting that the two HECs containing W would exhibit lower modulus.
As for the electronic structure, in the considered HECs, only the cation elements are different. For these refractory transition metals, d states are the main contributors to the bonding interactions. Here we compare the calculated projected density of states (PDOS) for d states of transition metals and p states of C atoms in Fig. 4. The DOS for these carbides are similar, with bonding and antibonding states separated by a pseudogap around −2 to −1 eV. Based on the overlap of DOS among the metal elements and C, it is seen that hybridization of Nb–C and Ta–C is higher than Zr–C in (NbTaZr)C below the Fermi level (Ef), suggesting strong covalent bonding of these two bonds. Adding W to (NbTaZr)C leads to a significant increase of DOS at Ef, resulting in instability of (NbTaZrW)C. On the other hand, incorporating Hf into (NbTaZr)C induces a lowering of DOS at Ef and promote the hybridization of Nb–C and Ta–C. For (NbTaZrHfW)C, its bonding strength depends on the competition between the two contradictory effects from W and Hf and, theoretically, should fall between that of (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHf)C. Finally, one can also appreciate that the pseudogap of the two W-containing HECs is father away from Ef than the other two, suggesting, again, that their Young's modulus should be lower than that of (NbTaZr)C.

Mechanical-related properties:
The Young's modulus of the four HECs measured using the ultrasonic method (E_ultrasonic) were listed in Table 1, in which those from DFT calculation (E_DFT) were also included. The differences between the experimental and calculated values are within 10%. In both cases, (NbTaZr)C has the lowest Young's modulus; and (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C exhibit lower Young's modulus compared to (NbTaZr)C. These observations are indeed consistent with the analysis based on their electronic structures as mentioned above. In spite of this, a consistent trend cannot be observed. For example, (NbTaZr)C has the highest experiment value while (NbTaZrHf)C presents the largest calculated value. There is no fixed values for the Young's modulus of the monocarbides. The reported range for NbC is 338–580 GPa; and that for TaC, ZrC, HfC, and WC are 285–560, 350–440, 350–510, and 620–720 GPa, respectively [46]. So, there is also a range of the ROM value (E_ROM, Table 1) for each multi-cation carbide. As shown in Table 1, both experiment and calculated values fall well in and close to the upper bound of the ROM values.
The nanohardness, microhardness, and fracture toughness of this series of carbides are listed in Table 3
                        . The nanohardness of the ternary- and quaternary-cation carbides ((NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrHf)C and (NbTaZrW)C) are higher than that of the quinary-cation carbide, (NbTaZrHfW)C. As for the microhardness, that of (ZrNbTaHf)C and (NbTaZrW)C are lower than that of the other two carbides. Differences in their relative density would contribute to the inconsistency between nanohardness and microhardness. The fracture toughness of (NbTaZr)C agrees well with the reported value (~2.9 MPa m1/2 [30]). Adding either Hf or W as cation enhanced the fracture toughness and the improvement by adding W is more pronounced. Among this series of HECs, (NbTaZrW)C possesses the highest fracture toughness (~4.02 MPa m1/2) and (NbTaZr)C exhibits the lowest (~3.07 MPa m1/2). These observations indicate that neither the hardness nor the fracture toughness of HECs depends solely on the number of cation; appropriate combination of cations should be selected for high-strength HEC design. In fact, similar conclusion has been drawn for high entropy alloys [49,50]. Overall, the (NbTaZrW)C exhibits the most promising combination of hardness and fracture toughness.
The nanohardness and fracture toughness of (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrHf)C, (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C were compared with that of the monocarbides in Fig. 5
                        . It is clear that the HECs exhibited enhanced hardness. This is indeed a general observation and was most-often attributed to the strong solid solution strengthening caused by the severe lattice distortion due to the compositional complexity [13–15,18–20,23]; the electronic mechanism was also reported as a possible contribution [18]. The fracture toughness of NbC, TaC, ZrC and HfC monocarbides were reported as 2.9 [20], 2.7 [14], 2.1 [20], and 2.9 MPa m1/2 [14], respectively. Thus, the fracture toughness of the HECs is also generally superior to that of the monocarbides. Ye et al. [14,20] suggested that the microcrack deflection toughening mechanism relating to the pullout of grain boundary-trapped irregular nanoplates would be one of the contributions toward the enhanced fracture toughness.
Although DFT calculations cannot provide direct calculations for hardness, some empirical methods are proposed to estimate the hardness of different materials based on some DFT outputs (such as bulk modulus). Using the empirical formula [51], we calculated and presented the hardness values of this series of carbides in Table 3. Even though the calculated results are generally lower than the experimental values, and the two sets of data does not exhibit exactly the same trend, both methods observed the hardness enhancement by incorporating Hf to (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrW)C. The beneficial effects of Hf to the hardnness is explainable through the above-mentioned electronic structure analysis which shows promoted hybridization and thus stronger bonding strength by incorporating Hf. Despite this, it is rather clear that there is not a single parameter (lattice distortion, hybridization) that correlates exactly well with the observed mechanical-related properties, including Young's modulus, nanohardness and fracture toughness. This raised the difficult in gaining mechanistic understanding of the observed differences which was most possibly the result of their synergistic effects. In HECs, their complexity in cation composition raised even more challenge to elucidate the mechanisms, since local environments may play important roles as they do in high entropy alloys [52,53]. For example, the fracture toughness depends on crack propagation under specific loading conditions and relies on a few parameters, such as the surface energy of the material, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio. For HECs, the surface energy will show large variations depending on the local compositions near the surface. In addition, a full understanding of the initiation and propagation of cracks also requires knowledge of the generalized stacking fault energy curves. Thus, more in-depth experimental and theoretical studies are certainly needed to provide solid understandings.
In Fig. 5, we also compiled the nanohardness (Fig. 5a) and fracture toughness (Fig. 5b) of other reported high entropy carbides [13,14,16–20,23–27,32], in which the load applied for the hardness tests were listed. We noted that the processing histories, relative densities, grain structures and other property-affecting factors as well as the test conditions (e.g., the applied load) of these carbides may not be consistent; but we still try to locate the properties of the current HECs in this bigger picture. Our first intuitive impression is that, the hardness of the current HECs are superior and their toughness are comparable to most reported high entropy carbides, including (NbTaZrTi)C, (NbTaMoVW)C, (NbZrTiV)C and (NbTaZrHfTi)C. Thus, the current set of HECs, especially the (NbTaZrW)C carbide, could serve as good starting compositions for future UTHC design through further cation doping and/or compositional tuning.

Summary and conclusions:
In the current work, a series of multi-equiatomic-cation (NbTaZr)C-based carbides, namely (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrHf)C, (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C, were produced using spark plasma sintering. The processing conditions were kept identical to properly identify the role of composition (i.e. the type of cation). Their phase component, microstructure and a few mechanical-related properties were assessed through multi-scale characterizations. DFT calculations were performed to analyze their lattice distortion and electronic structure. Based on the results, the following conclusions can be positively drawn:
                        
                           (1)
                           Upon sintering at 2200 °C for 10 min using SPS, single phase carbides with rock-salt structure are achievable for (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrHf)C, (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C;
                        
                        
                           (2)
                           Neither the hardness nor the fracture toughness of HECs depends solely on the number of cation; the hardness of the ternary- and quaternary-cation carbides ((NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrHf)C and (NbTaZrW)C are higher than that of the quinary-cation carbide, (NbTaZrHfW)C. Adding either W or Hf as cation to (NbTaZr)C enhances the fracture toughness. Among the four studied HECs, (NbTaZrW)C exhibits the best combination of nanohardness and fracture toughness;
                        
                        
                           (3)
                           Differences in the Young's modulus, hardness or fracture toughness of this series of HECs can be partly explained with the aid of the lattice distortion and electronic structure information; but certainly more in-depth experimental and theoretical studies are needed to provide a full elucidation and a solid understanding.
These findings indicate that appropriate combination of cations should be selected for high-strength HEC design. The comparison made for the current HECs and other reported high entropy carbides suggest that the current set of HECs, especially the (NbTaZrW)C carbide, could serve as good starting compositions for future UTHC design through further cation doping and/or compositional tuning.

Body:
Existing ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) are essentially not able to satisfy the continuous development and advancement of a few sharp technologies, such as nuclear and aerospace applications. It is thus critical to design and discover new materials to meet the increasingly demanding and diverse performance requirements and to broaden the applications to previously unexplored and/or unexplorable areas. The emergence of the concept of high entropy ceramic (HEC) [1,2] indeed motivated and enabled researchers from the field of metallurgy to move one big step toward the design of new UTHCs. This “entropy stabilization [1–4]" strategy was borrowed and extended from the two-decades-old concept of “high entropy alloy [5–12]”. Different from conventional UTHCs (metal oxides, carbides, silicides, nitrides and diborides) in which the cation positions are occupied by a single type of metallic elements, HECs typically have multiple metallic elements randomly locating at their cation positions. Compositional complexities of HECs led to a number of surprising properties, such as ultra-high hardness [1–4,13–19], high fracture toughness [20–27], high thermal stability [28,29] and a broad and composition-dependent adjustable range of thermal conductivity [30,31].

A (NbTaZr)C carbide was reported as a type of face-centered cubic (FCC) single-phase carbide [32]. Demirskyi et al. [32] reported its flexural strength performance at rather high temperatures (1600–2000 °C). A few other researchers investigated HECs containing Nb, Ta and Zr cations with different focuses. Dusza et al. [33] confirmed the composition homogeneity at micro and nano/atomic level of a highly-pure and dense (NbTaZrHf)C carbide fabricated through ball milling the constituent carbides and spark plasma sintering (SPS). Properties including hardness (36.1 GPa) and Young's modulus (598 GPa) of this quaternary carbide was reported by Castle et al. [13] in which the SPS process was delicately optimized (2300 °C, 7min). By incorporating one more cation, the quinary (NbTaZrHfTi)C HEC was more extensively studied than any others. Gild et al. [34] proposed a reactive flash SPS method for rapid synthesis; Zhou et al. [28] observed improved oxide resistance and thermal stability of (NbTaZrHfTi)C HEC compared to its original components. Moskovskikh et al. [21] fabricated (NbTaZrHfTi)C HEC with 94.8% relative density using SPS (2000 °C, 10min) and reported its hardness (25.7 GPa), Young's modulus (473 GPa) and thermal conductivity (5.6 Wm−1K−1). In addition to dense materials, porous (NbTaZrHfTi)C HEC was fabricated by Chen et al. [22] with the hope of obtaining HECs with reasonable strength (3.39 MPa) and low thermal conductivity (0.51Wm−1K−1) for thermal barrier applications. Other studied quinanry NbTaZr-series HECs include (NbTaZrMoTi)C and (NbTaZrTiW)C. Wang et al. [23] fabricated (NbTaZrMoTi)C with 98.6% relative density through hot pressing (2100 °C, 30min) the carbides powders obtained from carbonthermal reduction of oxides and reported its hardness (31.3 GPa at 100 mN force); Wei et al. [35] compared the extent of densification of (NbTaZrTiW)C bulks obtained through three different SPS-based routes without reporting any property.

Most of the above studies reported properties for a single ceramic without identifying the role of composition. Moreover, the effects of composition on multi-cation carbides cannot be easily extracted from these studies. For example, we cannot identify the effects of HfC, TiC and WC on (NbTaZr)C and that of TiC on (NbTaZrHf)C through the property data compiled from related studies [13–18,23,25–27,32]. This was mainly caused by their lack of consistency in bulk fabrication methods (SPS, reactive SPS, or hot pressing), sintering condition (temperature and duration), as well as the resulted relative density. Differences in property evaluations (flexural strength, hardness at different load) also contributed to the difficulty in composition effect isolation. Understanding the cation-type effect is essentially valuable toward the establishment of universally applicable microstructure- and property-prediction criteria and/or model and thus toward the facilitation of novel advanced UTHC development. As a step toward filling this gap, we, in the present study, assessed the microstructure and a few mechanical-related properties of the (NbTaZr)C carbide and a few representative quaternary- and quinary-cation carbides compositionally based on it, namely (NbTaZrHf)C, (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C. In the current study, we kept all variables other than composition identical.

The raw constituent powders, include TaC (~1.10 μm), ZrC (~1.35 μm), NbC (~1.20 μm), HfC (~1.10 μm), WC (~1.25 μm), were weighted and mixed in equiatomic proportions to obtain the (TaZrNb)C, (TaZrNbHf)C, (TaZrNbW)C and (TaZrNbHfW)C powder mixtures. The powder mixtures were ball milled at 250 rpm for 20 h in cemented carbide jar. The ball (cemented carbide, diameter: 5 mm) to powder mixture was 10:1. Before milling, the jar was filled with Ar gas. Subsequently, the powder mixture was sintered using SPS (LABOX-325 R Spark plasma sintering system, Japan); the sintering temperature was 2200 °C for 10min in vacuum, the pressure was maintained at 30 MPa during the sintering process.

Densities of the bulks were measured using the Archimedes’ method. The phase components and lattice parameters of the sintered parts were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Japan, Cu Kα, 40 kV, 40 mA, 5°/min, 30-80° range). Grain structure and micro-scale compositional homogeneity were visualized using scanning electron microscope (SEM, TESCAN MIRA3) operated in back-scattered electron (BSE) mode. Nano-scale elemental distribution was assessed using transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL F200). For SEM characterization, the specimens were ground to 1200 grit and polished using 0.02 μm colloidal silica; specimens for TEM were prepared using ion-milling method.

The nanohardness of the specimens were determined using a nanoindentation hardness tester (Nano indenter NanoTest Vantage); the maximum load for the tests were 50 mN with loading rate of 10 mN/s and the dwell time at the target load was 10s. The elastic modulus of the specimens were determined using an ultrasonic method. To this end, the surfaces of the sintered samples were well ground, followed by measurements of their thicknesses and time of flight with appropriate acoustic transducers, from which longitudinal and shear wave velocities were obtained. Assuming the materials are isotropic, their two independent elastic constants were calculated from the longitudinal and shear wave velocities using techniques described elsewhere [9,36].

Fracture toughness of this series of HECs was measured using the indentation technique. To achieve this, microhardness tests (SHIMADZU HMV-G-FA-S microhardness tester) were performed on their polished surfaces to obtain the values of microhardness and to generate cracks on the surfaces. A load of 9.8 N was used for this purpose. The radial crack length was measured from the center of the indent. For each specimen, 10 indentations were performed to obtained the average microhardness and crack length. From the measured elastic modulus, microhardness and crack length, the fracture toughness (KIc) of each material was calculated using the Antis equation [20,37].

To understand the experimental observations, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package [38,39]. Ion-electron interactions were described by projector augmented wave (PAW) approach [40]. The exchange-correlation interactions were modeled by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form [41]. The energy cutoff of plane waves was 600 eV. The considered HECs were modeled by a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of the rocksalt structure containing 64 atoms. A 5 × 5 × 5 k-point mesh based on the Monkhorst-Pack scheme was used. The convergence criteria for the total energy and atomic force were 10−4 eV and 10−2 eV/Å, respectively. The chemical disorder in the cation sublattice of HECs was modeled using special quasirandom structures (SQS) that were constructed by optimization of the Warren-Cowley short range order (SRO) parameters [42,43] with a Monte-Carlo simulated annealing algorithm [44]. The equilibrium lattice constant and bulk modulus was calculated by fitting the energy-volume relations to the Birch–Murnaghan (BM) equation of states [45]. Elastic constants of HECs were obtained by fitting the strain-energy relation with a series of strains applied to the cubic supercell of HECs (from −0.015 to +0.015). Three independent elastic constants, i.e., C11, C12, and C44 were calculated and other elastic parameters were deduced from the three constants.

                        a displays the XRD patterns of the synthesized bulks. For all 4 samples, other than a minor peak related to oxides, only peaks corresponding to FCC phase were observed, indicating the formation of single phase ceramics with a rock-salt structure (Fm

                        m). Their single phase nature was further confirmed by the BSE images presented in Fig. 1b–e, in which equiaxed grained structures for all materials were seen. For (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrW)C, (NbTaZrHf)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C, their grain sizes calculated from the corresponding microstructures were 16, 9, 9, and 10 μm, respectively and their relative densities are 99.5%, 97.3%, 97.3% and 100%, respectively.

SEM-EDS mapping was performed on (NbTaZrHfW)C as a representative to visualize the microscale homogeneity of this series of HEC and the results were presented in Fig. 2
                        . It can be seen that, the five constituent metallic component (Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, and W) distribute homogeneously without any sign of elemental segregation at this scale. Atomic ratios of Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, and W quantified from the mapping were 6.6, 6.9, 6.7, 7.1, and 6.9, respectively. The great discrepancy between this composition and the designed composition arose mainly from the difficulty of SEM-EDS in accurately quantifying light elements like C. Despite this, it is clear that the five metallic components equiatomically shared the cations. A high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image was shown in Fig. 3
                        a for further structural verification and visualization of the homogeneity for (NbTaZrHfW)C at nano/atomic scale. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern for this material shows no sign of ordering and no additional spots, indicating the absence of secondary phases. Further, the STEM-EDS exhibits no indication of elemental clustering or phase segregation. The structural determination and composition homogeneity identification through our multi-scale characterizaiton (XRD, SEM, and TEM) supports the formation of high entropy single-phase ceramics.

The single phase nature of (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C is consistent with previous observations [13,32]. It is noted that the pure form of all NbC, TaC, ZrC and HfC has a FCC crystal structure and, moreover, the solubility [46] is complete between each of these carbides; thus the formation of (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C as pure rock-salt ceramics should not be a surprise. WC has a hexagonal structure; it is mostly soluble in NbC and TaC and only slightly soluble in ZrC and HfC [46]. So replacing original cations (NbTaZr or NbTaZrHf) with enough W would de-stablize the FCC structure and cause phase separations. The retaining of the pure FCC structure for (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C indicated that WC has at least 25 at.% and 20 at.% solubility in (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C, respectively. Further, to help understand the formation of pure FCC carbides, we calculated the size misfit parameter (δ) [6] for each composition in two different ways. First, δ was calculated based on the lattice constants of pure carbides (4.4691, 4.454, 4.683 and 4.641 Å for NbC, TaC, ZrC, and HfC, respectively [46]). Since WC is not a FCC ceramic, we can only calculate δ for (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C in this manner. The obtained values were 2.31% and 2.22%, respectively. Another way to quantity δ was based on the atomic sizes of single metallic cation. The Seitz radii [47] of Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf and W are 1.625, 1.626, 1.771, 1.743, and 1.549 Å, respectively. δ values of (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrW)C, (ZrNbTaHf)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C calculated in this way were 4.1%, 4.9%, 3.9% and 5.0%, respectively. It is clear that all of the investigated multi-cation ceramics, (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrW)C, (ZrNbTaHf)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C, satisfy the Hume-Rothery-based size misfit criteria, δ ≤ 6.6% [6]. So the formation of single phase for the current ceramics is understandable.

Lattice parameters (Table 1
                        ) calculated from the XRD patterns for (NbTaZr)C, (ZrNbTaHf)C, (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C were 4.5359, 4.5606, 4.4836, and 4.5187 Å, respectively. The value of (NbTaZr)C is consistent with literature (4.535 Å) [46]. For NbTaZr and ZrNbTaHf, we were able to compare their measured lattice constants with the rule-of-mixture (ROM) values. It is seen from Table 1 that the experiment and ROM values matched well. Lattice constants calculated using DFT were also listed in Table 1. Despite the fact that the calculated value is slightly higher than the corresponding experimental one, the general trend matched well. Replacing 25% ternary and 20% quaternary cations in (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C with W both induced the reduction of lattice constants. Replacing 25% ternary and 20% quaternary cations in (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrW)C with Hf both induced the increase of lattice constants. The atomic size of W [47] is the smallest among all five constituent metallic component and that of Hf [47] is greater than Nb and Ta. Thus, the lattice contraction by W addition and lattice expansion by Hf addition can be well reasoned.

Since lattice distortion and electronic structure were recognized playing significant role in determining the mechanical-related properties of HECs, we provided corresponding analyses of this series of HECs in Table 2
                         and Fig. 4
                        , respectively. The local lattice distortion was calculated based on the obtained equilibrium structures following our previous methodology [48]. The radial displacements for each element are shown in Table 2. It is suggested that the HECs containing W ((NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C) exhibit more severe distortion than those without W ((NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrHf)C). The large distortion associated with W is attributed to its incompatible lattice with rock-salt structure since its ground states are not of the FCC type. Our previous results show that lattice distortion may soften HECs [48], suggesting that the two HECs containing W would exhibit lower modulus.

As for the electronic structure, in the considered HECs, only the cation elements are different. For these refractory transition metals, d states are the main contributors to the bonding interactions. Here we compare the calculated projected density of states (PDOS) for d states of transition metals and p states of C atoms in Fig. 4. The DOS for these carbides are similar, with bonding and antibonding states separated by a pseudogap around −2 to −1 eV. Based on the overlap of DOS among the metal elements and C, it is seen that hybridization of Nb–C and Ta–C is higher than Zr–C in (NbTaZr)C below the Fermi level (Ef), suggesting strong covalent bonding of these two bonds. Adding W to (NbTaZr)C leads to a significant increase of DOS at Ef, resulting in instability of (NbTaZrW)C. On the other hand, incorporating Hf into (NbTaZr)C induces a lowering of DOS at Ef and promote the hybridization of Nb–C and Ta–C. For (NbTaZrHfW)C, its bonding strength depends on the competition between the two contradictory effects from W and Hf and, theoretically, should fall between that of (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHf)C. Finally, one can also appreciate that the pseudogap of the two W-containing HECs is father away from Ef than the other two, suggesting, again, that their Young's modulus should be lower than that of (NbTaZr)C.

The Young's modulus of the four HECs measured using the ultrasonic method (E_ultrasonic) were listed in Table 1, in which those from DFT calculation (E_DFT) were also included. The differences between the experimental and calculated values are within 10%. In both cases, (NbTaZr)C has the lowest Young's modulus; and (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C exhibit lower Young's modulus compared to (NbTaZr)C. These observations are indeed consistent with the analysis based on their electronic structures as mentioned above. In spite of this, a consistent trend cannot be observed. For example, (NbTaZr)C has the highest experiment value while (NbTaZrHf)C presents the largest calculated value. There is no fixed values for the Young's modulus of the monocarbides. The reported range for NbC is 338–580 GPa; and that for TaC, ZrC, HfC, and WC are 285–560, 350–440, 350–510, and 620–720 GPa, respectively [46]. So, there is also a range of the ROM value (E_ROM, Table 1) for each multi-cation carbide. As shown in Table 1, both experiment and calculated values fall well in and close to the upper bound of the ROM values.

The nanohardness, microhardness, and fracture toughness of this series of carbides are listed in Table 3
                        . The nanohardness of the ternary- and quaternary-cation carbides ((NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrHf)C and (NbTaZrW)C) are higher than that of the quinary-cation carbide, (NbTaZrHfW)C. As for the microhardness, that of (ZrNbTaHf)C and (NbTaZrW)C are lower than that of the other two carbides. Differences in their relative density would contribute to the inconsistency between nanohardness and microhardness. The fracture toughness of (NbTaZr)C agrees well with the reported value (~2.9 MPa m1/2 [30]). Adding either Hf or W as cation enhanced the fracture toughness and the improvement by adding W is more pronounced. Among this series of HECs, (NbTaZrW)C possesses the highest fracture toughness (~4.02 MPa m1/2) and (NbTaZr)C exhibits the lowest (~3.07 MPa m1/2). These observations indicate that neither the hardness nor the fracture toughness of HECs depends solely on the number of cation; appropriate combination of cations should be selected for high-strength HEC design. In fact, similar conclusion has been drawn for high entropy alloys [49,50]. Overall, the (NbTaZrW)C exhibits the most promising combination of hardness and fracture toughness.

The nanohardness and fracture toughness of (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrHf)C, (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C were compared with that of the monocarbides in Fig. 5
                        . It is clear that the HECs exhibited enhanced hardness. This is indeed a general observation and was most-often attributed to the strong solid solution strengthening caused by the severe lattice distortion due to the compositional complexity [13–15,18–20,23]; the electronic mechanism was also reported as a possible contribution [18]. The fracture toughness of NbC, TaC, ZrC and HfC monocarbides were reported as 2.9 [20], 2.7 [14], 2.1 [20], and 2.9 MPa m1/2 [14], respectively. Thus, the fracture toughness of the HECs is also generally superior to that of the monocarbides. Ye et al. [14,20] suggested that the microcrack deflection toughening mechanism relating to the pullout of grain boundary-trapped irregular nanoplates would be one of the contributions toward the enhanced fracture toughness.

Although DFT calculations cannot provide direct calculations for hardness, some empirical methods are proposed to estimate the hardness of different materials based on some DFT outputs (such as bulk modulus). Using the empirical formula [51], we calculated and presented the hardness values of this series of carbides in Table 3. Even though the calculated results are generally lower than the experimental values, and the two sets of data does not exhibit exactly the same trend, both methods observed the hardness enhancement by incorporating Hf to (NbTaZr)C and (NbTaZrW)C. The beneficial effects of Hf to the hardnness is explainable through the above-mentioned electronic structure analysis which shows promoted hybridization and thus stronger bonding strength by incorporating Hf. Despite this, it is rather clear that there is not a single parameter (lattice distortion, hybridization) that correlates exactly well with the observed mechanical-related properties, including Young's modulus, nanohardness and fracture toughness. This raised the difficult in gaining mechanistic understanding of the observed differences which was most possibly the result of their synergistic effects. In HECs, their complexity in cation composition raised even more challenge to elucidate the mechanisms, since local environments may play important roles as they do in high entropy alloys [52,53]. For example, the fracture toughness depends on crack propagation under specific loading conditions and relies on a few parameters, such as the surface energy of the material, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio. For HECs, the surface energy will show large variations depending on the local compositions near the surface. In addition, a full understanding of the initiation and propagation of cracks also requires knowledge of the generalized stacking fault energy curves. Thus, more in-depth experimental and theoretical studies are certainly needed to provide solid understandings.

In Fig. 5, we also compiled the nanohardness (Fig. 5a) and fracture toughness (Fig. 5b) of other reported high entropy carbides [13,14,16–20,23–27,32], in which the load applied for the hardness tests were listed. We noted that the processing histories, relative densities, grain structures and other property-affecting factors as well as the test conditions (e.g., the applied load) of these carbides may not be consistent; but we still try to locate the properties of the current HECs in this bigger picture. Our first intuitive impression is that, the hardness of the current HECs are superior and their toughness are comparable to most reported high entropy carbides, including (NbTaZrTi)C, (NbTaMoVW)C, (NbZrTiV)C and (NbTaZrHfTi)C. Thus, the current set of HECs, especially the (NbTaZrW)C carbide, could serve as good starting compositions for future UTHC design through further cation doping and/or compositional tuning.

In the current work, a series of multi-equiatomic-cation (NbTaZr)C-based carbides, namely (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrHf)C, (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C, were produced using spark plasma sintering. The processing conditions were kept identical to properly identify the role of composition (i.e. the type of cation). Their phase component, microstructure and a few mechanical-related properties were assessed through multi-scale characterizations. DFT calculations were performed to analyze their lattice distortion and electronic structure. Based on the results, the following conclusions can be positively drawn:
                        
                           (1)
                           Upon sintering at 2200 °C for 10 min using SPS, single phase carbides with rock-salt structure are achievable for (NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrHf)C, (NbTaZrW)C and (NbTaZrHfW)C;
                        
                        
                           (2)
                           Neither the hardness nor the fracture toughness of HECs depends solely on the number of cation; the hardness of the ternary- and quaternary-cation carbides ((NbTaZr)C, (NbTaZrHf)C and (NbTaZrW)C are higher than that of the quinary-cation carbide, (NbTaZrHfW)C. Adding either W or Hf as cation to (NbTaZr)C enhances the fracture toughness. Among the four studied HECs, (NbTaZrW)C exhibits the best combination of nanohardness and fracture toughness;
                        
                        
                           (3)
                           Differences in the Young's modulus, hardness or fracture toughness of this series of HECs can be partly explained with the aid of the lattice distortion and electronic structure information; but certainly more in-depth experimental and theoretical studies are needed to provide a full elucidation and a solid understanding.

These findings indicate that appropriate combination of cations should be selected for high-strength HEC design. The comparison made for the current HECs and other reported high entropy carbides suggest that the current set of HECs, especially the (NbTaZrW)C carbide, could serve as good starting compositions for future UTHC design through further cation doping and/or compositional tuning.

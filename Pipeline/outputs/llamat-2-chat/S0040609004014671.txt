Input: Title:
Optical characterization of MoO
Output: [INST]<<SYS>>
You are a material scientist assisting researchers in extracting and structuring scientific data from research papers. 

Given:
1. A research paper text (within `<context> ... </context>`).
2. An incomplete table (within `<incomplete_table> ... </incomplete_table>`) containing placeholders such as `<blank_1>`, `<blank_2>`, etc. for the missing compositions.

Your Task:
1. Read the research paper carefully and identify the relevant "scientific chemical formulas" that correspond to each placeholder in the incomplete table.
2. Fill each placeholder (`<blank_1>`, `<blank_2>`, etc.) with the "exact" formula from the paper, "preferring scientific notation" (e.g., `"TiB2–20vol%B4C"`, `"80 Sb2O3–10 SrCl2–10 CdCl2"`), and "avoiding" any common/trivial names (e.g., “tungsten carbide” should appear in chemical form if possible).
3. "Ensure" that the composition you provide is complete, accurate, and found explicitly in the paper:
  - Do not guess or supply partial/incomplete data.
  - If the paper does not contain direct information for a placeholder, return NULL.
4. Do NOT use external knowledge beyond the content of the paper.

Output Requirements:
1. Return your answer as a valid JSON object containing a single key "Compositions" whose value is an array of objects.
2. Each object in the array must have two keys: "placeholder" (e.g., "<blank_1>") and "composition" (the corresponding scientific chemical formula).
3. No additional commentary should appear outside the JSON. Output only the JSON object with the “Compositions” array.
4. "Output Structure" the final answer as follows:
'''
{
      "Compositions": [
         {
            "placeholder": "<blank_1>",
            "composition": "..."
         },
         {
            "placeholder": "<blank_2>",
            "composition": "..."
         },
         ...
      ]
}
'''

Detailed Instructions:
1. Match Placeholders to Paper: For each placeholder in the incomplete table, look for sample names, IDs, or context from the paper that aligns with the placeholder’s row.
2. Preserve Scientific Formula: Write each formula in standard chemical or stoichiometric form (e.g., TiB2–20vol%B4C, 80 Sb2O3–10 SrCl2–10 CdCl2). Avoid using the compound’s trivial or trade names.
3. No Guesses: Do not fabricate or infer data not in the text. If the paper does not clearly give a composition, you may omit or label it as "composition": "not found".
4. Output Only JSON: The final output must be the JSON object with the “Compositions” array. Do not add text outside it.

Instructions Recap:
1. Read the research paper enclosed by <context> ... </context>.
2. Examine the incomplete table enclosed by <incomplete_table> ... </incomplete_table>.
3. Extract the exact scientific chemical formulas for each placeholder as they appear in the paper.
4. Return the results strictly in the JSON format shown above.

=== Paragraph 2 ===
Input: Abstract:
MoO3 thin films were prepared, in this work, evaporating the material with a CO2 laser set up in continuous wave mode. The films were deposited on glass substrates at different substrate temperatures and high vacuum. Additionally, other samples were prepared at different oxygen pressures in the chamber. The samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and optical transmittance measurements in the visible range. The XPS analyses showed evidence of thin film formation with two composition mix: MoO3 and MoO2; this result appeared in all fabricated samples. The transmittance spectra were reproduced theoretically and from the simulation were calculated the index of refraction, the absorption coefficient of the material, the forbidden energy gap and sample thickness. Samples prepared at high substrate temperature presented, in the red region, an absorption band of about 2.5×104 cm−1. This band kept its wavelength position when oxygen was injected in the chamber but its height decreased by one order of magnitude, indicating it is associated to oxygen vacancies in the sample.

You are a material scientist assisting researchers in extracting and structuring scientific data from research papers. 

Given:
1. A research paper text (within `<context> ... </context>`).
2. An incomplete table (within `<incomplete_table> ... </incomplete_table>`) containing placeholders such as `<blank_1>`, `<blank_2>`, etc. for the missing compositions.

Your Task:
1. Read the research paper carefully and identify the relevant "scientific chemical formulas" that correspond to each placeholder in the incomplete table.
2. Fill each placeholder (`<blank_1>`, `<blank_2>`, etc.) with the "exact" formula from the paper, "preferring scientific notation" (e.g., `"TiB2–20vol%B4C"`, `"80 Sb2O3–10 SrCl2–10 CdCl2"`), and "avoiding" any common/trivial names (e.g., “tungsten carbide” should appear in chemical form if possible).
3. "Ensure" that the composition you provide is complete, accurate, and found explicitly in the paper:
  - Do not guess or supply partial/incomplete data.
  - If the paper does not contain direct information for a placeholder, return NULL.
4. Do NOT use external knowledge beyond the content of the paper.

Output Requirements:
1. Return your answer as a valid JSON object containing a single key "Compositions" whose value is an array of objects.
2. Each object in the array must have two keys: "placeholder" (e.g., "<blank_1>") and "composition" (the corresponding scientific chemical formula).
3. No additional commentary should appear outside the JSON. Output only the JSON object with the “Compositions” array.
4. "Output Structure" the final answer as follows:
'''
{
      "Compositions": [
         {
            "placeholder": "<blank_1>",
            "composition": "..."
         },
         {
            "placeholder": "<blank_2>",
            "composition": "..."
         },
         ...
      ]
}
'''

Detailed Instructions:
1. Match Placeholders to Paper: For each placeholder in the incomplete table, look for sample names, IDs, or context from the paper that aligns with the placeholder’s row.
2. Preserve Scientific Formula: Write each formula in standard chemical or stoichiometric form (e.g., TiB2–20vol%B4C, 80 Sb2O3–10 SrCl2–10 CdCl2). Avoid using the compound’s trivial or trade names.
3. No Guesses: Do not fabricate or infer data not in the text. If the paper does not clearly give a composition, you may omit or label it as "composition": "not found".
4. Output Only JSON: The final output must be the JSON object with the “Compositions” array. Do not add text outside it.

Instructions Recap:
1. Read the research paper enclosed by <context> ... </context>.
2. Examine the incomplete table enclosed by <incomplete_table> ... </incomplete_table>.
3. Extract the exact scientific chemical formulas for each placeholder as they appear in the paper.

Input: Introduction:
MoO3 is a very attractive material due to its multiple technological applications [1–3]. MoO3 thin films have been produced by thermal evaporation, sputtering and electrochemical deposition [4,5].
One of the most interesting applications of MoO3 is known as smart window in which the device must regulate the amount of light going through it [6]. To optimize the devices, its behavior is modeled in computer, for which it is important to know the optical properties of the materials forming it. Determining the optical constants of MoO3 is quite difficult due to the presence of absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, which hinders the use of traditional calculation methods. Nonetheless, some authors have developed alternative methods to obtain the constants for these materials [7].
This work describes the synthesis of MoO3 thin films, prepared in high vacuum by evaporating a MoO3 target with a CO2 laser operating in continuous wave mode. Additionally, a method is proposed to calculate the optical constants of the material, using the theoretical simulation of experimental transmittance spectra in the visible and near infrared region. This simulation yields the spectral variations of the refraction index and absorption coefficient, the energy gap and the material's thickness. It also points at the influence of the substrate temperature and oxygen pressure in the chamber, on the optical properties of the material.

=== Paragraph 8 ===
Input: Production Of The Films:
The MoO3 thin films were deposited using the laser thermal evaporation technique Fig. 1 . A light beam coming from a CO2 laser is shined on a target made up of MoO3 powder (99.9%). The beam has a wavelength of 10.6 μm and an intensity of 0.73 W/mm2. The beam is introduced into the vacuum chamber through a GaAs lens and focused, with a Copper mirror, on the target. The MoO3 powder is hand pressed to avoid its dispersion toward the substrates by the application of the beam. The heat produced by the laser sublimates the material and it is deposited on common glass substrates (15 mm long and 10 mm wide) placed 10 cm above the powder.
The MoO3 target is rotated at about 20 rpm to avoid the formation of an irregular hole at the incidence point, which produces inhomogeneities on the sample thickness and modifies the deposition rate of the material.
Samples were prepared in vacuum and under different oxygen pressures. The optical constants were obtained in two series of samples. The first series was prepared in vacuum at different substrate temperatures ranging from room temperature to 350 °C, chamber pressure of 6×10−4 Pa, deposition time of 1 min and laser intensity of 0.73 W/mm2. The second series was carried out with constant substrate temperature of 300 °C, deposition time of 1 min, laser intensity of 0.23 W/mm2 and different oxygen pressures in the chamber. In this series, the vacuum chamber was taken to an initial pressure of 6×10−4 Pa.

=== Paragraph 9 ===
Input: Characterization Of The Samples:
Diffraction oxidations states of both MoO3 powder and prepared samples were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), using a VG-ESCA LAB 250 spectrometer with an energy resolution of 0.4 eV. Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation was used as the excitation source. The spectra were recorded in fixed analyzer transmission mode, the pass energy being 50 eV. The scanning of the spectra was done at pressures of 5×10−7 Pa. Binding energies were measured for O (1s) and Mo (3p). Peaks were fitted using a combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. This deconvolution was used to quantify the sensitive factors.
The films were also characterized through transmittance measurements in the visible and near infrared regions, using a double beam PERKIN ELMER lambda 2 spectrophotometer, operating at normal incidence on the sample surface.
Output: [INST]<<SYS>>
You are a material scientist assisting researchers in extracting and structuring scientific data from research papers. 

Given:
1. A research paper text (within `<context> ... </context>`).
2. An incomplete table (within `<incomplete_table> ... </incomplete_table>`) containing placeholders such as `<blank_1>`, `<blank_2>`, etc. for the missing compositions.

Your Task:
1. Read the research paper carefully and identify the relevant "scientific chemical formulas" that correspond to each placeholder in the incomplete table.
2. Fill each placeholder (`<blank_1>`, `<blank_2>`, etc.) with the "exact" formula from the paper, "preferring scientific notation" (e.g., `"TiB2–20vol%B4C"`, `"80 Sb2O3–10 SrCl2–10 CdCl2"`), and "avoiding" any common/trivial names (e.g., “tungsten carbide” should appear in chemical form if possible).
3. "Ensure" that the composition you provide is complete, accurate, and found explicitly in the paper:
  - Do not guess or supply partial/incomplete data.
  - If the paper does not contain direct information for a placeholder, return NULL.
4. Do NOT use external knowledge beyond the content of the paper.

Output Requirements:
1. Return your answer as a valid JSON object containing a single key "Compositions" whose value is an array of objects.
2. Each object in the array must have two keys: "placeholder" (e.g., "<blank_1>") and "composition" (the corresponding scientific chemical formula).
3. No additional commentary should appear outside the JSON. Output only the JSON object with the “Compositions” array.
4. "Output Structure" the final answer as follows:
'''
{
      "Compositions": [
         {
            "placeholder": "<blank_1>",
            "composition": "..."
         },
         {
            "placeholder": "<blank_2>",
            "composition": "..."
         },
         ...
      ]
}
'''

Detailed Instructions:
1. Match Placeholders to Paper: For each placeholder in the incomplete table, look for sample names, IDs, or context from the paper that aligns with the placeholder’s row.
2. Preserve Scientific Formula: Write each formula in standard chemical or stoichiometric form (e.g., TiB2–20vol%B4C, 80 Sb2O3–10 SrCl2–10 CdCl2). Avoid using the compound’s trivial or trade names.
3. No Guesses: Do not fabricate or infer data not in the text. If the paper does not clearly give a composition, you may omit or label it as "composition": "not found".
4. Output Only JSON: The final output must be the JSON object with the “Compositions” array. Do not add text outside it.

Instructions Recap:
1. Read the research paper enclosed by <context> ... </context>.
2. Examine the incomplete table enclosed by <incomplete_table> ... </incomplete_table>.
3. Extract the exact scientific chemical formulas for each placeholder as they appear in the paper.
4. Return the results strictly in the JSON format shown above.

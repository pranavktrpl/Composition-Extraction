Considering the TiO2 is listed separately and it's only 4.76%, then subtracting it from the total (100%), YSZ makes up most of the material, making the reported 95.24%YSZ reasonable.

But the percentages of each element compared to the overall molar mass are off significantly. Also, the model outputs percentage values of each element, while the ground truth is in terms of molar ratios of each element with respect to each other. The Zn value is zero in the model's extraction, which is not entirely accurate (0.05 in ground truth). Overall, the model's output deviates too much from the ground truth composition to be considered a match."

    "Abstract: In this work, phosphor materials with the formula YAlO3 were synthesized via sol-gel method by using the stoichiometric amounts of yttrium nitrate and aluminum nitrate as base materials.",
    "The obtained phosphors were doped/co-doped with Tb3+, Nd3+ rare earth ions and Mn2+ transition metal ion.",
    "Optical absorption spectra, photoluminescence (PL) and thermoluminescence (TL) were performed to determine a relationship the changing dopant on luminescence properties of YAlO3.",
    "Strong green emission was detected in the sample doped with Mn2+ correspond to 4T1(G)\u21926A1(S) transition.",
    "As for YAlO3: Nd3+, characteristic emissions originated from 4G11/2 \u2192 4I9/2 (\u223c423 nm), 4G9/2 \u2192 4I9/2 (\u223c460 nm) and 4G7/2 \u2192 4I9/2 (\u223c540 nm) transitions were seen.",
    "The optical band gap of undoped sample was calculated as 2.79 eV and depending on the presence of Nd3+ and Tb3+ dopant ions this value was decreased to the range 2.46\u20132.56 eV.

    "Introduction: In the recent years there has been an increasing interest in designing and developing of new efficient luminescent materials consist of the host and doped ion.",
    "Among many hosts, RAlO3 (R=Gd, Tb, Lu or Y) perovskites have emerged as a excellent host that can be used as an extensive luminescent material in lighting and micro imaging",
    "The Al2O3\u2013Y2O3 binary system has been used as starting materials due to their thermal conductivity and high temperature resistance, etc.",
    "In the yttria (Y2O3) - alumina (Al2O3) phase diagram, there are four different crystalline phases: YAP (Yttrium Aluminum Perovskite: YAlO3) with orthorhombic perovskite structure, YAH (Yttrium Aluminum Hexagonal: YAlO3) with metastable hexagonal structure, YAG (Yttrium Aluminum Garnet: Y3Al5O12) with cubic garnet structure and YAM (Yttrium Aluminium Monoclinic: Y4Al2O9) with monoclinic structure.",
    "Among these, YAlO3 (yttrium orthoaluminate perovskite), with good mechanical and thermal properties, natural birefringence and anisotropy, is well-suited material for being used as host for lasers, fast scintillators and phosphors",
    "Doping of rare earth ion helps in improving the efficiency of phosphor resulted from a partially filled 4fn (1 < n < 14) shell of the ion.",
    "Because it is known that 4f electrons are well shielded by 5s2 and 5p6 orbitals; depending on the 4f\u20134f inner-shell transitions rare earth elements have been widely used as dopant in phosphors to optimize the properties (high luminescence yield, narrow emission line, and long decay time constant)",
    "Recently, it has been observed that there has been an increase in studies on phosphor materials doped with rare earth ions due to their wide application areas (solid-state lighting, photovoltaic systems, solar cells, display, luminescent materials, catalysts, laser materials, radiation dosimeters etc.)",
    "Up on going through the literature, it has become obvious that YAP crystals are frequently doped with transition metal and rare-earth elements [1,4,12\u201315].",
    "Presence of two trivalent cations is leading to doping like this; transition metal and rare earth ions are doped at the Al and Y site, respectively.",
    "Until now, most publications on the synthesis of rare earth and transition metal doped YAlO3 have focused the Czochralski growing process that is used for the growth of the single crystal",
    "In literature there are reports on the thermoluminescence of many phosphors like aluminates, silicates, sulfates, borates, phosphates, fluorides [24,25,30\u201337].",
    "The metallic oxides-based TL material has received lots of attention due to their characteristics and their possible applications for radiation dosimetry",
    "[38], especially aluminate groups have significant properties such as chemically and thermally stability, high luminescence intensity, high quantum efficiency [39,40].",
    "Rare earth and transition metal ion doped YAlO3 phosphors also have strong termoluminescent sensitivity and negligible fading",
    "As to YAlO3:Mn2+ phosphors, although they are not a tissue-equivalent materials, it can be considered that YAlO3:Mn2+ is a good candidate for middle- and high-dose dosimetry of ionizing radiation due to repeatability, thermal fading, dose dependence, and effect of daylight exposure [44\u201346].",
    "In this work, we report on the aqueous based sol-gel synthesis that is accepted one of the easiest route to acquire homogeneous chemical composition [47] and luminescence (TL, PL) properties of YAlO3 phosphor doped/co-doped with Tb3+/Nd3+/Mn2+.",
    "Experimental Procedure: 2.1 Preparation and synthesis of Tb3+, Nd3+ and Mn2+ doped YAlO3 Pure, rare earth (Tb3+, Nd3+) and transition metal (Mn2+) doped/co-doped YAlO3 were synthesized by the sol-gel method by using yttrium nitrate [Y(NO3)3\u00b74H2O (purity 99.99%)], aluminum nitrate [Al(NO3)3\u00b79H2O (purity 99+%)]",

    "The stoichiometric amounts of Y(NO3)3\u00b74H2O was dissolved in distilled water (30 ml), then nitric acid was added into the solution with a 1:3 ratio of ions.",
    "Al(NO3)3\u00b79H2O were dissolved in another beaker and then this solution was slowly added to the Y(NO3)3\u00b74H2O + nitric acid solution mixture with continuous magnetic stirring at room temperature.",
    "The dopants were dissolved in 10 ml of ionized water and added to the prepared solution.",
    "At last, polyethylene glycol solution was added to the resultant mixture solution to get a better particle structure as a surfactant material.",
    "2.2 Characterization methodology The crystal phase and composition of the prepared phosphors were systematically studied by recording the XRD patterns using a PANanalytical Empyrean X-ray diffraction (XRD) appliance operated at 45 kV tube voltage and 40 mA tube current.",

    "The sizes of grains are decreased by the addition of RE3+ and the boundaries of grains began to come out.",
    "The XRD peaks of the samples matches well with the single phase of YAlO3, orthorhombic distorted perovskite structure (a=0.5303 nm, b=0.7348 nm, c=0.5169 nm, \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=90\u00b0; space group: Pnma D 2 h 16 )",
    "No extra phase was detected, indicating that doping Mn2+, Tb3+ or Nd3+ does not change the structure of YAlO3.",
    "Taking into account the ionic radius of the dopants and host material cations, the dopants are probably proposed to occupy Y3+ and Al3+ sites in the YAlO3 host lattice without causing any change in the crystal structure.",
    "As mentioned before, the samples have been prepared by sol-gel method, this minor mass difference has possibly related with the removal absorbed water molecules by the YAlO3.",
    "The second mass loss is from 250 to 550 \u00b0C and the lost weight which can be correspond to the combustion of the organic compounds is approximately 59.08%.",
    "The final observed mass loss (7.03%) is between 550 and 1400 \u00b0C and endothermic (at 1092 \u00b0C) and exothermic (at 1275 \u00b0C) reactions seen in DTA results may be ascribed to the crystallization of YAlO3.",
    "SEM micrographs and EDS graphs of YAlO3: Nd3+, YAlO3: Tb3+ and YAlO3:Mn2+/Nd3+ are shown in Fig. 3",
    "Further, intense peaks proving the existence of host (Y, Al, O) and dopant (Mn, Nd, Tb) elements are seen in EDS spectra.",
    "3.4 Optical properties of Mn 2+ , Nd 3+ and Tb 3+ doped YAlO3 3.4.1 Photoluminescence (PL) properties Fig.",
    "4 (a\u2013h) shows, the emission and the excitation spectra of YAlO3, YAlO3: Mn2+, YAlO3: Nd3+ (VIS), YAlO3: Nd+3 (NIR), YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ (VIS), YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ (NIR), YAlO3: Tb3+ and YAlO3: Mn2+/Tb3+, respectively.",
    "According to the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Mn2+ shown in Fig. 4(b), YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor shows a strong green emission at 526 nm.",
    "This emission is related to the transition 4T1(G)\u21926A1(S) of Mn2+ ions acting as an activating center.",
    "The disadvantage of the Mn2+ activator is that the d-d optical transitions are spin and parity forbidden.",
    "Further, in TL results, the Mn2+ doped sample has a very low intensity.",
    "Taking account this, Nd3+ and Tb3+ rare earth ions have been used as co-dopant to YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor.",
    "UV and NIR emission spectra of YAlO3: Nd3+ phosphor are shown in Fig.",
    "In Fig. 4(c), the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Nd3+ phosphor, characteristic emissions originating from 4G11/2 \u2192 4I9/2 (\u223c423 nm), 4G9/2 \u2192 4I9/2 (\u223c460 nm) and 4G7/2 \u2192 4I9/2 (\u223c540 nm) transitions have been observed.",
    "4(e) shows the VIS emission spectrum of YAlO3:",
    "Mn2+/Nd3+ phosphor taken at excitation wavelength of 384 nm.",
    "Because the luminescence light emitted in the green spectral region is characteristic of Mn2+ ions and can be expressed as Mn2++hv\u2192Mn3++e\u2212. Energy transfer causes an increase in the intensity of the emission, but this expected increase could not be observed.",
    "In Fig. 4(f), Nd3+ is used as a co-dopant to YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor and the NIR emission spectrum of this material is shown.",
    "Three different luminescence peaks are observed at 910 nm, 1064 nm and 1333 nm, belonging to Nd3+ ions, in NIR emission spectrum of YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+.",
    "Although characteristic transition emissions of Nd3+ are seen in this spectrum, when compared to the spectrum observed in 4(d), it has exhibited a lower intensity.",
    "Fig. 4(g) shows the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Tb3+ phosphor; four main peaks at 490 nm, 544 nm, 580 nm and 620 nm are associated with Tb3+ ions in YAlO3 host material.",
    "Therefore, it can be said that Tb3+ doped YAlO3 phosphor has the potential to be used as a green luminescence material.",
    "In Fig. 4(h), the PL spectrum taken in the VIS region for YAlO3: Mn2+/Tb3+ phosphor is shown.",
    "As it is well known, Mn2+ exhibits a sharp peak at 550 nm due to the 4T1(G)\u21926A1(S) transition.",
    "By adding Tb3+ to the same material, an energy transfer has occurred from the host material to Mn2+, and from Mn2+ to Tb3+ centers, and the intensity of this peak has increased.",
    "Additionally, the emission peaks of 5D3 5G6\u21927Fj (j:6,5,4) and 5D4\u21927Fj (j:6,5,4,3), which are caused by the characteristic transitions of Tb3+ ions, are also observed in this spectrum.",
    "5 (a) have been acquired in the wavelength region of 200\u2013800 nm for Mn2+, Nd3+ and Tb3+ doped and undoped YAlO3.",
    "As can be seen from the figure, the optical absorption spectrum of undoped YAlO3 has a broad absorption band, starting from\u223c500 nm, including the UV region and shifting towards the maximum absorption at\u223c240 nm.",
    "Depending on the presence of Nd3+ and Tb3+ dopant ions this value has decreased to the range 2.46\u20132.56 eV, while E g value in Mn2+ doped sample is higher than undoped sample (Fig. 6).",
    "Further an intermediary energy level under 2 eV has been observed in the graph of the sample with Tb3+ doped.",
    "It can be said that the TL graphs have suggested this intermediate energy level due to having the best result among the other doped samples of the Tb3+ doped sample.",
    "5(b) have been obtained in the wavelength region of 200\u2013800 nm for Mn2+/Nd3+, Mn2+/Tb3+ doped and undoped YAlO3.",
    "Also, the bandgap narrowing observed in graphs belong to Mn2+/Nd3+and Mn2+/Tb3+ doped sample can be explained by the Burstein-Moss bandgap narrowing phenomena; Ion doping can be defined as an increase in structural defects in the host lattice and it reduces the energy band gap by the presence of intermediary energy levels in the band gap.",
    "7 shows the CIE (Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage) chromaticity diagram of YAlO3:RE3+ (RE=Mn, Nd, Tb, Mn/Nd, Mn/Tb), and CIE coordinates are tabulated in Table 2 .",
    "CIE coordinates at the dominant wavelength for YAlO3:RE3+ (RE=Mn, Nd, Tb, Mn/Nd, Mn/Tb), were estimated as x d=0.122, y d=0.822 this value determined for 526 nm max emission wavelength which is showed at PL graphs.",
    "Accordingly, the color purities of host YAlO3, YAlO3:RE3+ (RE=Mn, Nd, Tb, Mn/Nd, Mn/Tb) were determined in the range of 69.31, 33.16, 33.45, 45.49, 76.14, 41.02%, respectively.",
    "The color purity of BaTa2O6:Mn2+ phosphor is 33.16%, which means being fairly close to white light.",
    "The CCT values of rare earth (Tb, Nd) doped and transition metal (Mn) doped/co-doped YAlO3 were found in the range of 2126.98, 4216.56, 6964.48, 5772.09, 7789.58, 6624.19 respectively.",
    "According to the results, it is seen that the glow curve of undoped YAlO3 has higher intensity.",
    "However, the TL intensity of doped YAlO3 samples has decreased remarkably due to the defects based on the ions in the crystal structure.",
    "It can be seen from presented results in Fig. 8(a) that there are two prominent TL peaks at 140 \u00b0C and 310 \u00b0C of undoped YAlO3 phosphor.",
    "The main TL glow curve of each sample is composed of many overlapping glow peaks based on the factors such as ion impurities, atomic displacement or vacancy defects in the material.",
    "A single main peak around 200 \u00b0C is observed in the TL glow curve of YAlO3: Tb+3 phosphor in Fig. 9",
    "Based on the experimental observation, the doping of Tb+3 ion has increased the TL glow curve intensity, this behavior is a consequence of the high electron trapping ability of the defects formed by doping of the Tb+3 ion in the aluminate-based crystal lattice.",
    "It is important to note that by doping of Tb+3 ion it might be possible to improve the TL glow curve intensity.",
    "10 exhibits TL characteristic of the studied YAlO3: Nd3+ sample within 150\u2013350 \u00b0C.",
    "Further, dopping Nd3+ has affected the intensity after 375 \u00b0C and a weak peak has been observed.",
    "It is thought that Nd3+ ions, which act as a luminescence center in the host crystal, cause a decrease in luminescence intensity by filling the existing atomic spaces.",
    "In order to understand the TL kinetic of YAlO3 crystal, the TL glow curve parameters (activation energy, frequency factor and kinetic order) have calculated using CGDC (Table 7 ) and peak shape method (Table 8 ).",
    "As can be seen from the YAlO3: Mn2+ TL curve (Fig. 11 ), the intensity in TL curves of the YAlO3 host material has decreased by the dopping of Mn2+ ions and has not exhibited a distinct glow curve.",
    "Therefore, kinetic parameter calculation has not applied for YAlO3: Mn+2.",
    "The Tb3+ ion has been used as the co-dopant in YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor and observed a significant increase of intensity when compared to the TL curve of YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor (Fig. 12 ).",
    "Besides, the peak obtained at about 200 \u00b0C is thought to be a characteristic peak of Tb3+ in the host material.",
    "As seen in Fig. 13 , YAlO3: Mn+2/Nd+3 TL glow curve detected in the temperature range of 50\u2013400 \u00b0C, there are TL peaks at temperatures exceeding 180 \u00b0C and 400 \u00b0C due to the presence of trapped electrons in deeper traps.",

    "The protective layer of dioxide (PuO2) on the surface is unable to limit the corrosion of this metal and unexpected phenomena, such as pyrophoricity and moisture-accelerated rapid corrosion, were observed.",
    "Now the overall corrosion behavior of plutonium is believed to be contributed or catalyzed by the reactive compounds such as plutonium hydrides and sesquioxide.",
    "So far most of the research has focused on plutonium oxides [4\u201318] and hydrides [8,19\u201324], and ignored the other reactive compound such as plutonium monoxide monohydride (PuOH).",
    "PuOH is a potentially reactive compound formed by corrosion of Pu in liquid water or moisture at room temperature",
    "In particular, PuOH is considered to initiate the rapid hydride-catalyzed corrosion of PuOH-coated plutonium metals [3,29], and identified as a key product to understand the chloride-catalyzed corrosion of plutonium in glovebox atmospheres [30].",
    "The following equation (1) Pu ( s ) + H 2 O ( l ) \u2192 PuOH ( s ) + 1 2 H 2 ( g ) describes the formation of PuOH in near-neutral water and also determines the composition of the product from experimental data showing that 0.5 mol of H2 is formed by the reaction of 1.0 mol of Pu.",

    "From the XRD analysis, PuOH has a CaF2-related structure formed by a cationic sublattice of Pu (III) and an anionic sublattice of O2\u2212 and H\u2212. However, the specific arrangement of O and H atoms is unknown, which may be ascribed to the small scattering cross section of these light atoms with respect to the heavy Pu atom.",
    "This structural uncertainty has impeded in-depth understanding and further exploration of PuOH.",
    "Moreover, there are very limited experimental reports of the basic properties of PuOH, which may be attributed to the difficulties in preparing and handling samples.",
    "Besides the above-mentioned partially-determined structure, only the thermodynamic properties about the formation enthalpies of PuOH, the reactions of PuOH and PuOH-coated Pu with O2 are estimated [29].",

    "If the O-H system in the central region of the fcc lattice is viewed as the O-H mixture, the F 4 \u00af 3 m mixture is the most homogeneous and the segregation of the P 4 / n m m and P 4 \u00af 3 m mixtures are the most serious.",
    "Total energies for the six possible fluorite-related structures of PuOH are calculated within density functional theory as a function of lattice constant.",
    "Notice first that our calculation shows that the F 4 \u00af 3 m phase is the most stable whatever the exchange-correlation functional approximation we choose.",
    "Besides, all the relative energies of the other phases are greater than 81 meV (equivalent to 940 K), which implies that PuOH would only adopt the space group F 4 \u00af 3 m (Fig. 1 (a)) in the room temperature or intermediate temperature.",
    "The statement might be universal for various Pu + O + H systems, which signifies that the stability of the system may be achieved for the homogeneous O-H mixture and hydrogen transport may be rapid for the low-oxygen system.",
    "In this cubic unit cell defined by lattice parameter a 0 , the crystallographic positions are Pu 4a (0,0,0), H 4c ( 1 4 , 1 4 , 1 4 ) , and O 4d ( 3 4 , 3 4 , 3 4 ) (or H 4d and O 4c).",
    "Since the NM phase of PuOH is not energetically favorable compared with their FM and AFM phases, we will concentrate on the phases with magnetic order.",
    "This large value of energy difference suggests that the F 4 \u00af 3 m phase of PuOH is AFM.",
    "Similar to the study of PuO2 and PuH2 [10,11,19], the Hubbard U correction in the LDA/GGA+U approach leads to an increase of the equilibrium lattice parameter.",
    "Both the pure LDA and GGA underestimated the lattice parameter of FM and AFM PuOH, as clearly shown in Fig.",
    "In addition, since the distance between the neighboring Pu atoms of PuOH is almost the same as that of PuO2, the localized degree of 5f electrons in PuOH is similar to that in PuO2.",
    "Then we argue that DFT+U approach is more appropriate to describe the properties of PuOH than pure DFT.",
    "Therefore it is suitable for us to focus on the results obtained from LDA+U with U=4.0 eV, which we assumed to be the reference value for PuOH and also chosen in the study of Pu [31] and PuO2 [11].",

    "The values of c 11 and c 12 of PuOH are up to 50% smaller than that of PuO2, while the value of c 44 of PuOH is almost the same as that of PuO2.",

    "Below the Fermi level, the shape of O- 2 p pDOS follows that of Pu- 5 f pDOS, especially for the peak around \u22122 eV.",
    "These indicate the probable presence of Pu-O covalent bond.",

    "And the charge density distribution around Pu atom is significantly deformed toward O atoms, forming a square-like shape due to the Td point group of 4a Wyckoff position.",
    "The covalent bridges between Pu and O atoms are clear and there are also visible bridges between Pu and H atoms.",
    "Since there is a blank area between H and O atoms and their distance is as large as 2.7 \u00c5 ( a 0 / 2 ), we can deduce that there is no H-O bond in this system and PuOH is not an alkali.",
    "This conclusion agrees with the experimental observation that PuOH is insoluble in near-neutral water",

    "Body: Plutonium (Pu) is a material with very unusual physical and chemical properties.",
    "Moreover, the corrosion of plutonium [2,3], which is extremely important for Pu's handling and storage, is also distinct from that of the other active metals.",
    "The protective layer of dioxide (PuO2) on the surface is unable to limit the corrosion of this metal and unexpected phenomena, such as pyrophoricity and moisture-accelerated rapid corrosion, were observed.",
    "Now the overall corrosion behavior of plutonium is believed to be contributed or catalyzed by the reactive compounds such as plutonium hydrides and sesquioxide.",
    "So far most of the research has focused on plutonium oxides [4\u201318] and hydrides [8,19\u201324], and ignored the other reactive compound such as plutonium monoxide monohydride (PuOH).",
    "PuOH is a potentially reactive compound formed by corrosion of Pu in liquid water or moisture at room temperature",
    "In particular, PuOH is considered to initiate the rapid hydride-catalyzed corrosion of PuOH-coated plutonium metals [3,29], and identified as a key product to understand the chloride-catalyzed corrosion of plutonium in glovebox atmospheres [30].",
    "The following equation (1) Pu ( s ) + H 2 O ( l ) \u2192 PuOH ( s ) + 1 2 H 2 ( g ) describes the formation of PuOH in near-neutral water and also determines the composition of the product from experimental data showing that 0.5 mol of H2 is formed by the reaction of 1.0 mol of Pu.",
    "The identification of PuOH is also based on the thermal gravity (TG), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses [26].",
    "From the XRD analysis, PuOH has a CaF2-related structure formed by a cationic sublattice of Pu (III) and an anionic sublattice of O2\u2212 and H\u2212. However, the specific arrangement of O and H atoms is unknown, which may be ascribed to the small scattering cross section of these light atoms with respect to the heavy Pu atom.",
    "This structural uncertainty has impeded in-depth understanding and further exploration of PuOH.",
    "Moreover, there are very limited experimental reports of the basic properties of PuOH, which may be attributed to the difficulties in preparing and handling samples.",
    "Besides the above-mentioned partially-determined structure, only the thermodynamic properties about the formation enthalpies of PuOH, the reactions of PuOH and PuOH-coated Pu with O2 are estimated [29].",
    "In fact, density-functional study has already been performed to deeply understand the basic properties of plutonium metal, oxides and hydrides [10\u201324,31].",
    "Therefore it is interesting and necessary to perform the density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate the ground state properties of PuOH, including the prediction of the Wyckoff positions of O and H. To our best knowledge, only References",
    "[32,33] listed the calculated lattice parameter, bulk modulus, and enthalpy of formation of PuOH with the crystal structure being unspecified.",
    "In this work, we have predicted the ground state crystal structure from the perspective of the energetic stability, and systematically calculate the electronic, optical, mechanical and thermodynamic properties of PuOH.",
    "[35,36] pseudopotentials for Pu, O, and H with the 6 s 2 7 s 2 6 p 6 6 d 2 5 f 4 , 2 s 2 2 p 4 , and 1 s 1 valence electronic configurations are chosen.",
    "In order to capture the localization effect of the f electrons coming from the strong electron-electron interaction, we employed the so-called DFT+U approach which has been successfully applied to \u03b4-plutonium",
    "[31], plutonium oxides",
    "[31] and PuO2 [11].",
    "Because Pu is a heavy metal element, SOC is expected to be important for the physics of plutonium compounds.",
    "However, in the case of PuO2, the inclusion of SOC has little effect on the bulk and one-electron properties [9,12].",
    "For PuOH, our test calculations within LDA+U approaches, inclusion of SOC will increase the equilibrium lattice parameter by only 0.14% and the bulk modulus by only 2 GPa.",
    "As concerns the fluorite-related structures of PuOH, Pu occupied the positions in a face-centered cubic (fcc) configuration while O or H occupied the eight tetrahedral sites of the fcc lattice.",
    "In order to consider all the possible arrangements, one can randomly select four tetrahedral sites to accommodate the H atoms and the residual tetrahedral sites for the O atoms.",
    "For F 4 \u00af 3 m phase (Fig. 1 (a)), four hydrogen atoms are fully separated from each other and the corresponding symmetry is the highest.",
    "For P 4 2 / m m c and P 4 / n m m phase (Fig. 1 (c) and (d)), four hydrogen atoms are located in the {110} and {100} plane, respectively.",
    "For P 4 \u00af 2 m phase (Fig. 1 (e)), three hydrogen atoms constitute a right-angle and the fourth hydrogen atom is located away from them.",
    "If the O-H system in the central region of the fcc lattice is viewed as the O-H mixture, the F 4 \u00af 3 m mixture is the most homogeneous and the segregation of the P 4 / n m m and P 4 \u00af 3 m mixtures are the most serious.",
    "Total energies for the six possible fluorite-related structures of PuOH are calculated within density functional theory as a function of lattice constant.",
    "Notice first that our calculation shows that the F 4 \u00af 3 m phase is the most stable whatever the exchange-correlation functional approximation we choose.",
    "Besides, all the relative energies of the other phases are greater than 81 meV (equivalent to 940 K), which implies that PuOH would only adopt the space group F 4 \u00af 3 m (Fig. 1 (a)) in the room temperature or intermediate temperature.",
    "The statement might be universal for various Pu + O + H systems, which signifies that the stability of the system may be achieved for the homogeneous O-H mixture and hydrogen transport may be rapid for the low-oxygen system.",
    "In this cubic unit cell defined by lattice parameter a 0 , the crystallographic positions are Pu 4a (0,0,0), H 4c ( 1 4 , 1 4 , 1 4 ) , and O 4d ( 3 4 , 3 4 , 3 4 ) (or H 4d and O 4c).",
    "Since the NM phase of PuOH is not energetically favorable compared with their FM and AFM phases, we will concentrate on the phases with magnetic order.",
    "This large value of energy difference suggests that the F 4 \u00af 3 m phase of PuOH is AFM.",
    "Similar to the study of PuO2 and PuH2 [10,11,19], the Hubbard U correction in the LDA/GGA+U approach leads to an increase of the equilibrium lattice parameter.",
    "Both the pure LDA and GGA underestimated the lattice parameter of FM and AFM PuOH, as clearly shown in Fig.",
    "In addition, since the distance between the neighboring Pu atoms of PuOH is almost the same as that of PuO2, the localized degree of 5f electrons in PuOH is similar to that in PuO2.",
    "Then we argue that DFT+U approach is more appropriate to describe the properties of PuOH than pure DFT.",
    "Therefore it is suitable for us to focus on the results obtained from LDA+U with U=4.0 eV, which we assumed to be the reference value for PuOH and also chosen in the study of Pu [31] and PuO2 [11].",
    "Clearly, our calculations predicted that PuOH is an AFM insulator, which is similar to PuO2.",
    "It is interesting to compare the structure properties of PuOH with that of PuO2 [11] and PuH2 [23] with the same fluorite-related structure.",
    "It is intuitive to regard that there is a monotonic evolution along PuO2 \u2192 PuOH \u2192 PuH2.",
    "But for the lattice parameter, the value of PuOH in the LDA/GGA+U formalism is greater than that of PuO2 (5.338/5.444 \u00c5 [11]) and PuH2 (5.337/5.418 \u00c5",
    "In Table 2 we listed the calculated elastic constants, elastic moduli, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature of F 4 \u00af 3 m -PuOH.",
    "Obviously, the F 4 \u00af 3 m phase of PuOH is mechanically stable.",
    "So was the case of PuO2 [12].",
    "Next let us compare the mechanical properties of PuOH with that of PuO2 [12] with the same fluorite-related structure.",
    "Take the results from LDA+U framework as an example ( c 11=319.6 GPa, c 12=177.8 GPa, c 44=74.5 GPa for PuO2 [12]).",
    "The values of c 11 and c 12 of PuOH are up to 50% smaller than that of PuO2, while the value of c 44 of PuOH is almost the same as that of PuO2.",
    "This signifies that PuOH is sensitive to compress strain and insensitive to shear strain compare to PuO2.",
    "4 we plot the total density of states (DOS) as well as the projected DOS for the Pu 5f, Pu 6d, O 2p, H 1s orbitals of PuOH within the LDA and LDA+U formalisms.",
    "Obviously, the ground state of F 4 \u00af 3 m -PuOH is predicted to be metallic for the pure LDA and insulating for LDA+U, which is similar to PuO2 [10\u201312].",
    "Based on the ubiquitous localized nature of 5f electron in Pu compound and the above discussion in section 3.2, we conclude that PuOH is an antiferromagnetic insulator with space group F 4 \u00af 3 m .",
    "Note that there is no experimental evidence about the insulating nature of PuOH from the available literature.",
    "From the partial DOS (pDOS), F 4 \u00af 3 m -PuOH is predicted to be a charge-transfer insulator from the pDOS in Fig.",
    "This behavior is similar to PuO2 [50,51], but not Pu2 O3 which has the same formal charge with PuOH.",
    "Below the Fermi level, the shape of O- 2 p pDOS follows that of Pu- 5 f pDOS, especially for the peak around \u22122 eV.",
    "These indicate the probable presence of Pu-O covalent bond.",
    "In order to clarify the bonding character in PuOH, we present in Fig.",
    "For one Pu atom, there are two nearest-neighboring H atoms and two nearest-neighboring O atoms in one (110) plane, as illustrated in Fig.",
    "And the charge density distribution around Pu atom is significantly deformed toward O atoms, forming a square-like shape due to the Td point group of 4a Wyckoff position.",
    "The covalent bridges between Pu and O atoms are clear and there are also visible bridges between Pu and H atoms.",
    "Since there is a blank area between H and O atoms and their distance is as large as 2.7 \u00c5 ( a 0 / 2 ), we can deduce that there is no H-O bond in this system and PuOH is not an alkali.",
    "This conclusion agrees with the experimental observation that PuOH is insoluble in near-neutral water",
    "To understand the ionicity of PuOH, we carry out the Bader's charge analysis [52] and the results are listed in the bottom of Fig.",
    "The charge value of O atom in PuOH is close to that in PuO2 (7.20 e)",
    "[12], and the charge value of H atom is close to that in PuH3 (1.50 e)",

    "Keywords: CuInSe2 Positron lifetime Formation energy Energy level Stoichiometry Intrinsic defects Introduction: The electrical and optical properties of many ternary ionic compounds such as CuInSe2 are dominated by the presence of intrinsic point defects.",
    "These defects are related to the stoichiometry and the thermal history of the specimens.",
    "Based on a new calculation of the formation energies of some of these defects, the defect chemistry as a function of the stoichiometry was simulated.",
    "The results of the simulations are compared with positron lifetime measurements in CuInSe2 single crystals of various compositions.",
    "Assuming that the cation\u2013anion antisite defects do not occur, one can distinguish eight acceptor and donor defects with the following charge states [1,2] V Cu \u03b1\u2212m \u2212, V In \u03b2\u2212m \u2212 , Se i \u03b3\u2212m \u2212, Cu",

    "Another important point is the behavior of defect pairs in CuInSe2.",
    "For example, an isolated VCu acts as an acceptor, an isolated InCu as a donor, but a defect pair on (2VCu\u2013InCu) is electrically inactive.",
    "The deviations from the ideal chemical formula of CuInSe2 can be described by two parameters, the non-molecularity \u0394M and the non-stoichiometry \u0394S, which are defined as [6] \u0394M=Cu tot In tot \u2212 a b \u0394S=\u03b3 Se tot \u03b1 Cu tot +\u03b2",
    "From the remaining eight point defects, the four cation\u2013anion antisites; CuSe, InSe, SeCu and SeIn were omitted in the calculations; five isolated defects (VCu, VSe, Cui, CuIn and InCu) and the one defect pair (2VCu\u2013InCu) occur for the calculated formation energies (Fig. 1).",
    "The concentrations of the defects were affected very differently: Variations of the formation energy of the VCu-vacancy lead to significant changes of the VCu concentrations, whereas the concentration of the CuIn antisite defect remains constant for variations of about 1 eV. The defect pair (2VCu\u2013InCu) occurs in the whole composition range due to their low formation energy.",
    "For the simulations, the defect is assumed to be neutral, although there is a calculated (0/+) transition of the (InCu\u2013VCu) pair at 200 meV below the conduction band.",
    "The results of these simulations lead to the assumption, that the investigated specimens include the following defects: VCu,VSe, CuIn and the defect pair (2VCu\u2013InCu).",
    "Therefore, temperature dependent measurements were also carried out starting at 40 K. For the positron lifetime experiments, a pair of identically treated samples was sandwiched with the positron source consisting of radioactive 22Na (0.5 MBq).",
    "The observed lifetime is close to the value that has been obtained for the divacancies in CuInSe2, from the theoretical calculation of the positron lifetimes (Table 2).",
    "We assume that the predicted defect pair (2VCu\u2013InCu) produces this positron lifetime, because the complex includes two copper vacancies and the calculated lifetime for the copper divacancy is 277 ps (Table 2).",
    "The low copper composition of the sample and the results of the calculations point to the copper vacancy.",
    "Since no bulk lifetime could be determined for these specimens, the concentration of the detected defects was estimated to be at least 3\u00d71018 cm\u22123.",
    "This could be an antisite defect such as Cu2\u2212 In,which has been proposed for this composition.",
    "The predicted selenium vacancy from the calculations cannot be detected by positron lifetime spectroscopy, because of their positive charge.",
    "The shallow level may be caused by the (0/+) transition of the selenium vacancy and the deep trap by the (0/+) transition of the (InCu\u2013VCu)+ pair or the (+/2+) transition of VSe.",
    "The increasing trap concentration for a decrease of the selenium content in the specimens points to the selenium vacancy.",

    "Introduction: So far, investigation on the improvement of dielectric and electrical properties with the temperature stability of dielectric constant (\u0394\u03b5 \u2032=100 \u00d7(\u03b5 \u2032 T-\u03b5 \u2032 30 \u00b0C)/ \u03b5 \u2032 30 \u00b0C) of the CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO)",
    "Accordingly, investigation for X8R capacitors has been extensively studied and there are only a few articles that reported for CCTO-based compound [2,14,15].",
    "However, there are no reports for X9R capacitor based on CCTO ceramic materials.",
    "Generally, X9R capacitors have been intensively studied and reported in ferroelectric perovskite compounds [13,16], normally sintered at high temperature, which is a disadvantage of the preparation process due to high energy consumption and might probably cause a seriously environmental problem.",
    "In order to improve the dielectric and electrical properties with a novel satisfy condition for \u0394\u03b5 \u2032 of CCTO-based compound to meet the X8R and X9R capacitors, many approaches have been proposed for the preparation of the materials such as (1) doping and co-doping with various metals in CCTO ceramics to improve the electrical properties of grain boundaries (GBs)",
    "[2,17\u201319], (2) doping with some metals in CCTO/CaTiO3 composites",
    "[15,20], (3) using appropriate sintering conditions to enhance GB layers [21\u201323] and (4) increasing the Ti molar concentration in CCTO compound to produce TiO2-rich CCTO ceramics [24\u201327], Among these approaches, (1), (2) and (3) are the most ones that have been intensively reported [15,17\u201319,28,29] with a few of them that can successfully achieve for X8R capacitors such as the studies on Mg2+ doped CCTO/CaTiO3 [15], La3+ doped CCTO [8] and Zn-doping CCTO",
    "Furthermore, the study by approach (4) reported only the dielectric properties at room temperature without the study of \u0394\u03b5 \u2032. For instance, Lin and coworkers [25] reported the effect of TiO2-rich in the microstructure and dielectric properties of CCTO (CaCu3Ti4+xO12; x=0.00\u20131.5) ceramics prepared by solid state reaction method.",
    "They found that TiO2 impurity phase trended to increase with increasing Ti content, resulting in the decrease of \u03b5 \u2032 and tan\u03b4 values to ~4233 and ~0.03, respectively.",
    "[24] reported the dielectric properties (\u03b5 \u2032 ~5.5 \u00d7104 and tan\u03b4 ~0.2) of TiO2-rich CCTO ceramics derived by a sol gel method.",
    "Hao and coworkers [30] reported the preparation of CCTO/xTiO2 (x=0.0\u20132.0) ceramics by using a sol gel technique and found that the tan\u03b4 and \u03b5 \u2032 values decreased with increasing Ti content, due to the presence of TiO2 secondary phase.",
    "Other than this, it was also found that the CCTO/TiO2 composite ceramics had an advantage over the ferroelectric perovskite materials, because it could be prepared by a one-step process from a nominal CaCu3Ti4+xO12 composition [24,25] with sintering temperature lower than that of ferroelectric perovskite compounds.",
    "Consequently, it will be superior that the dielectric properties, nonlinear characteristics and \u0394\u03b5 \u2032 of the CCTO/TiO2 ceramics can be concurrently improved with a novel innovation that might support the capacitors technology.",
    "Recently, it was also found that Zn2+ doping in CCTO-based ceramics [2,31\u201334] and co-doping with others metal",
    "[19,35] could improve not only the electrical properties, but also simultaneously enhance the \u0394\u03b5 \u2032. For instance, high performance dielectric properties with the satisfy \u0394\u03b5 \u2032 for X8R capacitor could be achieved in the Zn2+ ions doped CaCu2Ti4O12 ceramics",
    "According to this report and literature, it is supposed that Zn2+-doped CaCu2Ti4O12/TiO2 ceramics could simultaneously improve the dielectric properties with the satisfy \u0394\u03b5 \u2032 for the X8R and X9R capacitors.",
    "In this work, CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 (x=0.00, 0.05 and 0.10) precursor powders were prepared by the polymer pyrolysis (PP) solution method",

    "Microstructure and elemental mapping of ceramic samples were explored by scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6510LV, Oxford Instrument) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDXS).",
    "Subsequently, both surfaces were coated with Au using a sputtering unit (Polaron SC500).",
    "The percentage of Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio in all ceramic samples was calculated using equation provided in our previous work [36].",
    "[39] of the XRD patterns of all ceramic samples, which can be identified to correspond with the standard data for CaCu3Ti4O12 (ICSD card No.95714), having the body center cubic (bcc) structure.",
    "As expected, a minor peak of TiO2 phase (ICSD card No. 26715) is observed in the XRD patterns of all Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics with no detection of ZnO impurity phase due to the insensitivity of the XRD technique to any phase of concentration less than 0.5 wt% [40,41].",
    "According to the RRPFs, the CaCu3Ti4O12:TiO2 ratios of Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1, T101-2, Zn05-2 and Zn10-2 ceramics were determined and found to be 100.0:0.0, 97.9:2.1, 94.9:5.1, 100.0:0.0, 97.0:3.0, 95.7:4.3, respectively.",
    "It is notable that the TiO2 fraction significantly increases with increasing Zn2+ doping content.",
    "In addition, the lattice parameter a values of all ceramic samples reveal no significant change with the increase of Zn2+ content due to the slightly different ionic radius of Cu2+ (0.87 \u00c5) and Zn2+ (0.88 \u00c5).",
    "Moreover, all lattice parameters (a) are comparable with that of the CCTO ceramics (a=7.391 \u00c5) reported in literature",
    "Additionally, the theoretical densities (D xrd ) of undoped-CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics are lower than those of the Zn2+-doped CaCu3Ti4.1O12 ceramics due to the replacement of a lighter Cu atom (63.546 amu) by a heavier Zn atom (65.380 amu).",
    "Generally, dielectric and nonlinear characteristic of CCTO-based ceramics are significantly dependent on their microstructure [21,43].",
    "Therefore, it is necessary to consider the microstructure evolutions of these CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 ceramics.",
    "Obviously seen in Table 1 that, the AGs of all ceramic samples decrease with increasing Zn2+ doping content due to the solute drag mechanism [36,44] originate from the slight difference in ionic radii of Zn2+ (0.86 \u00c5) dopant and Cu2+ (0.87 \u00c5) host ions, including the existence of TiO2 phase.",
    "Furthermore, AGs of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics significantly increase with the sintering temperature, as obviously seen in Table 1.",
    "This behavior is similar to those observed in the microstructure of CCTO-based ceramics",
    "The frequency dependence of \u03b5 \u2032 and tan\u03b4 for Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are shown in Fig.",
    "In Fig. 3(a), \u03b5 \u2032 values (at 30 \u00b0C and 1 kHz) of Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1 ceramics are found to be 130,566, 9200 and 4985, respectively.",
    "It is notable that \u03b5 \u2032 value of Ti01-1 ceramic decreases with increasing Zn2+ content.",
    "Interestingly, \u03b5 \u2032 values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are almost stable in the frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 MHz and further rapidly drop above 1 MHz, while that of Ti01-1 ceramic slightly decreases in the range of 100 Hz to 0.2 MHz and then rapidly drop above 0.2 MHz.",
    "In addition, it is found that \u03b5 \u2032 values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are approximately 14 and 26 times lower than that of the Ti01-1 ceramic.",
    "As seen in the inset (1) of Fig. 3(a), at 30 \u00b0C and 1 kHz, tan\u03b4 values are found to be 0.09, 0.017 and 0.026 for Ti01-1, Zn05-1, Zn10-1 ceramics, respectively.",
    "Surprisingly, it is found that tan\u03b4 values of Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics are under the red dashed line (the red dashed line signifies tan\u03b4=0.05) in a wide frequency range of 100\u201330,000 Hz and 100\u201310,000 Hz, respectively.",
    "Meanwhile, tan\u03b4 value of Ti01-1 ceramic is above this red dashed line with value higher than 0.05 for the whole range of frequency.",
    "Inset (2) of Fig. 3(a) displays a nonlinear J\u2013E characteristic of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics.",
    "At 30 \u00b0C, \u03b1 and E b value of Ti01-1, Zn05-1 and Zn10-1 ceramics were determined and found to be (4.51, 25.94, 49.66) and (599.45, 13146.25, 6626.06 V.cm\u22121), respectively.",
    "It is obvious that the lowest tan\u03b4 value of 0.017 observed in the Zn05-1 ceramic is consistent with the highest E b value.",

    "Interestingly, the lowest tan\u03b4 value is obtained in the Zn10-2 ceramic, which is suggested to originate from the highest R gb value (the highest potential barrier at grain boundary).",
    "As obviously seen in the inset (2) of Fig. 3(b), the highest E b value of 6029.65 V.cm\u22121 is obtained for the Zn10-2 ceramic with the lower values of 683.05 and 3070.25 V.cm\u22121 for Ti01\u20132 and Zn05-2 samples, respectively.",

    "Generally, substitution of Zn2+ ions at the Cu2+ site does not generate free electron.",
    "Thus, the decrease of oxygen vacancy in these Zn2+-doped Ti01 ceramic might be related with the concentration of the single- and double-ionized oxygen vacancy [62], as expressed by Eqs. (2)\u2013(5).",

    "Now the overall corrosion behavior of plutonium is believed to be contributed or catalyzed by the reactive compounds such as plutonium hydrides and sesquioxide.",
    "So far most of the research has focused on plutonium oxides [4\u201318] and hydrides [8,19\u201324], and ignored the other reactive compound such as plutonium monoxide monohydride (PuOH).",

    "The following equation (1) Pu ( s ) + H 2 O ( l ) \u2192 PuOH ( s ) + 1 2 H 2 ( g ) describes the formation of PuOH in near-neutral water and also determines the composition of the product from experimental data showing that 0.5 mol of H2 is formed by the reaction of 1.0 mol of Pu.",
    "The identification of PuOH is also based on the thermal gravity (TG), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses [26].",
    "From the XRD analysis, PuOH has a CaF2-related structure formed by a cationic sublattice of Pu (III) and an anionic sublattice of O2\u2212 and H\u2212. However, the specific arrangement of O and H atoms is unknown, which may be ascribed to the small scattering cross section of these light atoms with respect to the heavy Pu atom.",
    "This structural uncertainty has impeded in-depth understanding and further exploration of PuOH.",
    "Moreover, there are very limited experimental reports of the basic properties of PuOH, which may be attributed to the difficulties in preparing and handling samples.",
    "Besides the above-mentioned partially-determined structure, only the thermodynamic properties about the formation enthalpies of PuOH, the reactions of PuOH and PuOH-coated Pu with O2 are estimated [29].",

    "Results And Discussion: 3.1 Crystal structure As concerns the fluorite-related structures of PuOH, Pu occupied the positions in a face-centered cubic (fcc) configuration while O or H occupied the eight tetrahedral sites of the fcc lattice.",

    "For F 4 \u00af 3 m phase (Fig. 1 (a)), four hydrogen atoms are fully separated from each other and the corresponding symmetry is the highest.",

    "For the structure with lowest symmetry, P 4 2 22 phase (Fig. 1 (f)), four hydrogen atoms constitute two right angles.",
    "If the O-H system in the central region of the fcc lattice is viewed as the O-H mixture, the F 4 \u00af 3 m mixture is the most homogeneous and the segregation of the P 4 / n m m and P 4 \u00af 3 m mixtures are the most serious.",
    "Total energies for the six possible fluorite-related structures of PuOH are calculated within density functional theory as a function of lattice constant.",
    "Notice first that our calculation shows that the F 4 \u00af 3 m phase is the most stable whatever the exchange-correlation functional approximation we choose.",
    "Besides, all the relative energies of the other phases are greater than 81 meV (equivalent to 940 K), which implies that PuOH would only adopt the space group F 4 \u00af 3 m (Fig. 1 (a)) in the room temperature or intermediate temperature.",
    "The statement might be universal for various Pu + O + H systems, which signifies that the stability of the system may be achieved for the homogeneous O-H mixture and hydrogen transport may be rapid for the low-oxygen system.",
    "In this cubic unit cell defined by lattice parameter a 0 , the crystallographic positions are Pu 4a (0,0,0), H 4c ( 1 4 , 1 4 , 1 4 ) , and O 4d ( 3 4 , 3 4 , 3 4 ) (or H 4d and O 4c).",
    "Since the NM phase of PuOH is not energetically favorable compared with their FM and AFM phases, we will concentrate on the phases with magnetic order.",
    "This large value of energy difference suggests that the F 4 \u00af 3 m phase of PuOH is AFM.",
    "Similar to the study of PuO2 and PuH2 [10,11,19], the Hubbard U correction in the LDA/GGA+U approach leads to an increase of the equilibrium lattice parameter.",
    "Both the pure LDA and GGA underestimated the lattice parameter of FM and AFM PuOH, as clearly shown in Fig.",
    "In addition, since the distance between the neighboring Pu atoms of PuOH is almost the same as that of PuO2, the localized degree of 5f electrons in PuOH is similar to that in PuO2.",
    "Then we argue that DFT+U approach is more appropriate to describe the properties of PuOH than pure DFT.",
    "Therefore it is suitable for us to focus on the results obtained from LDA+U with U=4.0 eV, which we assumed to be the reference value for PuOH and also chosen in the study of Pu [31] and PuO2 [11].",
    "Clearly, our calculations predicted that PuOH is an AFM insulator, which is similar to PuO2.",
    "It is interesting to compare the structure properties of PuOH with that of PuO2 [11] and PuH2 [23] with the same fluorite-related structure.",
    "It is intuitive to regard that there is a monotonic evolution along PuO2 \u2192 PuOH \u2192 PuH2.",
    "But for the lattice parameter, the value of PuOH in the LDA/GGA+U formalism is greater than that of PuO2 (5.338/5.444 \u00c5 [11]) and PuH2 (5.337/5.418 \u00c5",
    "In Table 2 we listed the calculated elastic constants, elastic moduli, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature of F 4 \u00af 3 m -PuOH.",
    "Obviously, the F 4 \u00af 3 m phase of PuOH is mechanically stable.",
    "So was the case of PuO2 [12].",
    "Next let us compare the mechanical properties of PuOH with that of PuO2 [12] with the same fluorite-related structure.",
    "Take the results from LDA+U framework as an example ( c 11=319.6 GPa, c 12=177.8 GPa, c 44=74.5 GPa for PuO2 [12]).",
    "The values of c 11 and c 12 of PuOH are up to 50% smaller than that of PuO2, while the value of c 44 of PuOH is almost the same as that of PuO2.",
    "This signifies that PuOH is sensitive to compress strain and insensitive to shear strain compare to PuO2.",
    "4 we plot the total density of states (DOS) as well as the projected DOS for the Pu 5f, Pu 6d, O 2p, H 1s orbitals of PuOH within the LDA and LDA+U formalisms.",
    "Obviously, the ground state of F 4 \u00af 3 m -PuOH is predicted to be metallic for the pure LDA and insulating for LDA+U, which is similar to PuO2 [10\u201312].",
    "Based on the ubiquitous localized nature of 5f electron in Pu compound and the above discussion in section 3.2, we conclude that PuOH is an antiferromagnetic insulator with space group F 4 \u00af 3 m .",
    "Note that there is no experimental evidence about the insulating nature of PuOH from the available literature.",
    "From the partial DOS (pDOS), F 4 \u00af 3 m -PuOH is predicted to be a charge-transfer insulator from the pDOS in Fig.",
    "This behavior is similar to PuO2 [50,51], but not Pu2 O3 which has the same formal charge with PuOH.",
    "Below the Fermi level, the shape of O- 2 p pDOS follows that of Pu- 5 f pDOS, especially for the peak around \u22122 eV.",
    "These indicate the probable presence of Pu-O covalent bond.",
    "In order to clarify the bonding character in PuOH, we present in Fig.",
    "For one Pu atom, there are two nearest-neighboring H atoms and two nearest-neighboring O atoms in one (110) plane, as illustrated in Fig.",
    "The charge density distribution around O and H atoms are nearly circular with slight deformation toward Pu atoms.",
    "And the charge density distribution around Pu atom is significantly deformed toward O atoms, forming a square-like shape due to the Td point group of 4a Wyckoff position.",
    "The covalent bridges between Pu and O atoms are clear and there are also visible bridges between Pu and H atoms.",
    "Since there is a blank area between H and O atoms and their distance is as large as 2.7 \u00c5 ( a 0 / 2 ), we can deduce that there is no H-O bond in this system and PuOH is not an alkali.",
    "This conclusion agrees with the experimental observation that PuOH is insoluble in near-neutral water",
    "To understand the ionicity of PuOH, we carry out the Bader's charge analysis [52] and the results are listed in the bottom of Fig.",
    "The charge value of O atom in PuOH is close to that in PuO2 (7.20 e)",
    "[12], and the charge value of H atom is close to that in PuH3 (1.50 e)",
    "In addition, the charge of Pu atom in PuOH is lower than that in PuO2 (13.60 e)",
    "[12] but larger than that in PuH3 (14.58 e)",
    "[23], which indicates the lower valence state of Pu atom (Pu III).",
    "3.5 Optical properties Due to the radioactivity of plutonium compounds, contactless identification of various materials is very necessary, and obviously one of the useful tools is optical detection.",
    "Thus understanding the optical properties of PuOH is extremely important.",
    "The reflectivity and absorption coefficients of PuOH are plotted in Fig.",
    "Reflectivity of PuOH at \u03c9=0 is not far from the value obtained for PuO2 [11,56].",
    "3.6 Thermodynamical properties All the above discussions are about zero-temperature, but the state of a physical system is usually relevant to the finite temperature T. From this perspective, it is of great importance to understand the thermodynamical properties of PuOH.",
    "Usually, the thermodynamical properties are easily measurable and for PuOH, some thermodynamical quantities are already estimated in Ref.",
    "Due to the mass difference among Pu, O, and H atoms, Pu atoms contribute the lowest acoustic phonon bands (0\u20135 THz), followed by O atoms (9\u201312 THz), and finally H atoms (29\u201332 THz).",

This paper reports the further correlation of the members of this new (TMAs)2CoCl4 family through the room temperature single crystal X-ray structure analyses of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4, and (TMSb)2ZnBr4, and through a reconsideration of the reported structures of (TMAs)2CoCl4 and (TMAs)2ZnCl4.",

    "The structures, except (TMSb)2ZnBr4, were solved by direct methods [8], with final refinements made with SHELXTL or SHELXTL PLUS",
    "[9] software (TMSb+ salts only).",
    "Hydrogen atoms were constrained to C\u2013H distances of 0.96\u00c5 and their isotropic thermal parameters were set at \u22481.2 times the equivalent isotropic thermal parameters of associated carbon atoms.",

    "The structure was solved in the space group F 4 \u0304 3c by starting with the refined coordinates of the (TMSb)2CuCl4 structure.",
    "These reflections were removed, the refinement converged with wR=0.054, with reasonable behavior of the thermal parameters for C(4).",
    "The final atomic parameters for (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4, and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 at room temperature are listed in Table 2 and bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 3 .",
    "The unit cell of (TMP)2CoCl4 is shown in Fig.",
    "1 and a stereoview of an octant of the unit cell of (TMSb)2ZnBr4, with 0<x, y, z<1/2, is shown in Fig.",
    "The room temperature structures of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuCl4 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 are composed of discrete monopositive cations and dinegative anions",
    "The ions are significantly disordered, as shown by the large carbon thermal ellipsoids for the atoms in the cations and the even larger halide atom ellipsoids of most of the atoms in the anions.",
    "The high symmetry sites occupied by the anions in the cubic structures of (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 further complicate the analysis of their geometries.",
    "In (TMSb)2CuCl4 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 at room temperature, the MX 4 2\u2212 anions occupy two crystallographically inequivalent sites, having 23.(T) and 4 \u0304 ..(S4) symmetry.",
    "The similar ellipsoids for both salts implies that the disorder for the copper salt is not primarily due to the averaging of expected tetragonally compressed CuC14 2\u2212 tetrahedra caused by the Jahn\u2013Teller effect.",
    "The anions occupying the S4 sites are significantly less disordered and are nearly tetrahedral, with maximum bond angles of 116.1(3) and 113.2(2)\u00b0 for the copper and zinc salts, respectively.",
    "The 116.1\u00b0 angle is significantly smaller than the expected 128\u2013140\u00b0 range typically found in discrete Jahn\u2013Teller distorted CuCl4 2\u2212 anions in similar structures [11,12].",
    "The expected Jahn\u2013Teller distortion of the CuCl4 2\u2212 anions also explains the different phase transition sequences experienced by the (TMSb)2CuX 4 (X=Cl, Br) salts versus the (TMSb)2 MX 4 (M=Co, Zn; X=Cl, Br) salts.",
    "As reviewed in the Introduction, (TMSb)2CuCl4 apparently undergoes two phase transitions below room temperature, (TMSb)2CuBr4 apparently undergoes one, and the rest of the (TMSb)2 MX 4 salts undergo no sub-room temperature phase transitions.",
    "Then if, as expected, the CuX 4 2\u2212 anions are Jahn\u2013Teller distorted, the onset of ordering in the Cu salts at lower temperatures requires the simultaneous lowering of the anion site symmetries to D2d or one of its subgroups, which in turn drives the phase transitions to lower symmetry space groups.",

    "Using the superspace notation developed for one-dimensional modulated structures, [14,15] the 3+1 superspace Bravais Class of the room temperature structures of (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 is T Pm3\u0304m 1\u03041\u0304s ( 1 2 , 1 2 , 1 2 ) and their common superspace group is T Pm3\u0304m 1\u03041\u0304s .",

    "The structures of (TMP)2CoCl4, (TMSb)2CuC14 and (TMSb)2ZnBr4 are lower symmetry analogs of the aristotype.",
    "The latter two Sb salts have nearly isostructural arrangements of ions, so the following discussion or pictures of (TMSb)2ZnBr4 also apply to (TMSb)2CuCl4.",
    "2 and 4 show sub-unit cells of (TMSb)2ZnBr4 and (TMP)2CoCl4 corresponding to a single unit cell of the Fm 3 \u0304 m aristotype.",
    "The octant (TMSb)2ZnBr4 shown in Fig. 2 coincides with the modulated parent cell discussed above, so an adjacent (unpictured) octant is similar.",
    "The subsection of (TMP)2CoCl4 shown in Fig. 4 is a simple multiple (doubling) of the modulated parent cell discussed above, so it also represents a quasi-unit cell.",
    "In regard to these alternate paths of ascent it may be noted that there are no plausible supergroups of C42/mcd (P42/mbc), the space group of the room temperature phase structures of (TMAs)2ZnCl4 and (TMAs)2CoCl4.",
    "With respect to the analysis of (TMP)2CoC14, (TMSb)2ZnBr4 and (TMSb)2CuCl4 as modulated structures, as discussed above, the space groups of the unmodulated parent structures can be obtained directly from Fig.",

    "Based on a new calculation of the formation energies of some of these defects, the defect chemistry as a function of the stoichiometry was simulated.",
    "The results of the simulations are compared with positron lifetime measurements in CuInSe2 single crystals of various compositions.",
    "Assuming that the cation\u2013anion antisite defects do not occur, one can distinguish eight acceptor and donor defects with the following charge states [1,2] V Cu \u03b1\u2212m \u2212, V In \u03b2\u2212m \u2212 , Se i \u03b3\u2212m \u2212, Cu",

    "Another important point is the behavior of defect pairs in CuInSe2.",
    "For example, an isolated VCu acts as an acceptor, an isolated InCu as a donor, but a defect pair on (2VCu\u2013InCu) is electrically inactive.",
    "The deviations from the ideal chemical formula of CuInSe2 can be described by two parameters, the non-molecularity \u0394M and the non-stoichiometry \u0394S, which are defined as [6] \u0394M=Cu tot In tot \u2212 a b \u0394S=\u03b3 Se tot \u03b1 Cu tot +\u03b2",
    "From the remaining eight point defects, the four cation\u2013anion antisites; CuSe, InSe, SeCu and SeIn were omitted in the calculations; five isolated defects (VCu, VSe, Cui, CuIn and InCu) and the one defect pair (2VCu\u2013InCu) occur for the calculated formation energies (Fig. 1).",
    "The concentrations of the defects were affected very differently: Variations of the formation energy of the VCu-vacancy lead to significant changes of the VCu concentrations, whereas the concentration of the CuIn antisite defect remains constant for variations of about 1 eV. The defect pair (2VCu\u2013InCu) occurs in the whole composition range due to their low formation energy.",
    "For the simulations, the defect is assumed to be neutral, although there is a calculated (0/+) transition of the (InCu\u2013VCu) pair at 200 meV below the conduction band.",
    "The results of these simulations lead to the assumption, that the investigated specimens include the following defects: VCu,VSe, CuIn and the defect pair (2VCu\u2013InCu).",
    "Therefore, temperature dependent measurements were also carried out starting at 40 K. For the positron lifetime experiments, a pair of identically treated samples was sandwiched with the positron source consisting of radioactive 22Na (0.5 MBq).",
    "The observed lifetime is close to the value that has been obtained for the divacancies in CuInSe2, from the theoretical calculation of the positron lifetimes (Table 2).",
    "We assume that the predicted defect pair (2VCu\u2013InCu) produces this positron lifetime, because the complex includes two copper vacancies and the calculated lifetime for the copper divacancy is 277 ps (Table 2).",
    "The low copper composition of the sample and the results of the calculations point to the copper vacancy.",
    "Since no bulk lifetime could be determined for these specimens, the concentration of the detected defects was estimated to be at least 3\u00d71018 cm\u22123.",
    "This could be an antisite defect such as Cu2\u2212 In,which has been proposed for this composition.",
    "The predicted selenium vacancy from the calculations cannot be detected by positron lifetime spectroscopy, because of their positive charge.",
    "The shallow level may be caused by the (0/+) transition of the selenium vacancy and the deep trap by the (0/+) transition of the (InCu\u2013VCu)+ pair or the (+/2+) transition of VSe.",

    "It was illustrated that the dielectric constant of composites with 40\u201350wt% glass increased incipiently, achieved the maximum value at 875\u00b0C and reduced subsequently with the increasing of temperature, while the samples of 55wt% and 60wt% showed a gradual decrease.",
    "It was also worth pointing out that the influence of glass content on the dielectric constant of the composites could not be ignored.",
    "The permittivity increased with increasing glass content from 40wt% to 50wt% and decreased as the glass content increased from 50wt% to 60wt%.",

    "It was reasonable for the composites of low glass content to have lower permittivity owing to poor densification and a large number of pores.",
    "As the glass content increased to 50wt% that was sufficient to wrap the Al2O3 particles, the pores gradually disappeared.",
    "However, the dielectric constant decreased with further increase in glass content to 60wt% because Al2O3 had higher permittivity (9.8)",

    "In summary, the CBS glass/Al2O3 composites prepared with 50wt% CBS glass and sintered at 875\u00b0C demonstrated the most excellent comprehensive properties: \u03b5r of 8.06 and tan\u03b4 of 1.2\u00d710\u22123 at 7GHz, flexural strength of 204MPa, thermal expansion coefficient of 5.47ppm/\u00b0C, and thermal conductivity of 3.1W/mK.",
    "In addition, the comparison between the typical commercial LTCC materials [18] and the CBS glass/Al2O3 in this work was given in Table 2.",
    "It was worth pointing out that the dielectric loss and the thermal expansion of the CBS glass/Al2O3 composites was lower than most of the commercial LTCC substrate materials.",
    "To further investigate the co-firing compatibility of the LTCC composites and metal electrodes, glass/Al2O3 composites prepared with 50wt% CBS glass were chosen to co-fire with Ag electrodes at 875\u00b0C and 900\u00b0C, and the X-ray diffraction patterns of the co-fired samples was shown in Fig.",
    "6. It can be observed that there were only \u03b1-Al2O3 (JCPDS#82-1468), anorthite (JCPDS#41-1486) and Ag phase (JCPDS#04-0783), implying that no chemical reaction have taken place between the glass/Al2O3 composites and Ag electrodes.",
    "These results guaranteed the CBS glass/Al2O3 composite extremely apt for LTCC applications.",
    "In this study, CaO-B2O3-SiO2 (CBS) glass/Al2O3 composites for LTCC application were synthesized and the sintering behavior, phase compositions, microstructure and properties were investigated.",
    "The composites with different CBS glass contents were sintered at different temperatures.",
    "Results showed that a proper amount of low melting point glass not only efficiently promoted the sintering densification of the composites, but also significantly improved the dielectric, mechanical and thermal performances.",
    "During the sintering process, the chemical reactions between glass and Al2O3 led to the appearance of anorthite phases.",
    "The composites prepared with 50wt% glass sintered at 875\u00b0C for 15min showed a dense and pore-less microstructure and exhibited quite excellent performance: bulk density of 3.12g/cm3, \u03b5r of 8.06 and tan\u03b4 of 1.2\u00d710\u22123 at 7GHz, flexural strength of 204MPa, thermal expansion coefficient of 5.47ppm/\u00b0C, and thermal conductivity of 3.1W/mK. Besides, the composites could meet the shrinkage requirement of Ag electrodes and could hardly react with Ag electrodes.",

    "Introduction: So far, investigation on the improvement of dielectric and electrical properties with the temperature stability of dielectric constant (\u0394\u03b5 \u2032=100 \u00d7(\u03b5 \u2032 T-\u03b5 \u2032 30 \u00b0C)/ \u03b5 \u2032 30 \u00b0C) of the CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO)",
    "Accordingly, investigation for X8R capacitors has been extensively studied and there are only a few articles that reported for CCTO-based compound [2,14,15].",
    "However, there are no reports for X9R capacitor based on CCTO ceramic materials.",
    "Generally, X9R capacitors have been intensively studied and reported in ferroelectric perovskite compounds [13,16], normally sintered at high temperature, which is a disadvantage of the preparation process due to high energy consumption and might probably cause a seriously environmental problem.",
    "In order to improve the dielectric and electrical properties with a novel satisfy condition for \u0394\u03b5 \u2032 of CCTO-based compound to meet the X8R and X9R capacitors, many approaches have been proposed for the preparation of the materials such as (1) doping and co-doping with various metals in CCTO ceramics to improve the electrical properties of grain boundaries (GBs)",
    "[2,17\u201319], (2) doping with some metals in CCTO/CaTiO3 composites",
    "[15,20], (3) using appropriate sintering conditions to enhance GB layers [21\u201323] and (4) increasing the Ti molar concentration in CCTO compound to produce TiO2-rich CCTO ceramics [24\u201327], Among these approaches, (1), (2) and (3) are the most ones that have been intensively reported [15,17\u201319,28,29] with a few of them that can successfully achieve for X8R capacitors such as the studies on Mg2+ doped CCTO/CaTiO3 [15], La3+ doped CCTO [8] and Zn-doping CCTO",
    "Furthermore, the study by approach (4) reported only the dielectric properties at room temperature without the study of \u0394\u03b5 \u2032. For instance, Lin and coworkers [25] reported the effect of TiO2-rich in the microstructure and dielectric properties of CCTO (CaCu3Ti4+xO12; x=0.00\u20131.5) ceramics prepared by solid state reaction method.",
    "They found that TiO2 impurity phase trended to increase with increasing Ti content, resulting in the decrease of \u03b5 \u2032 and tan\u03b4 values to ~4233 and ~0.03, respectively.",
    "[24] reported the dielectric properties (\u03b5 \u2032 ~5.5 \u00d7104 and tan\u03b4 ~0.2) of TiO2-rich CCTO ceramics derived by a sol gel method.",
    "Hao and coworkers [30] reported the preparation of CCTO/xTiO2 (x=0.0\u20132.0) ceramics by using a sol gel technique and found that the tan\u03b4 and \u03b5 \u2032 values decreased with increasing Ti content, due to the presence of TiO2 secondary phase.",

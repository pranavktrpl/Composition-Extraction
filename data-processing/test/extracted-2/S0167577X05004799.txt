Title:
Fabrication and mechanical/conductive properties of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) reinforced carbon matrix composites

Abstract:
Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) reinforced carbon matrix (MWNT/C) composites have been explored using mesophase pitch as carbon matrix precursor in the present work. Results show that carbon nanotubes (CNTs)can enhance the mechanical properties of carbon matrix significantly. The maximal increment of the bending strength and stiffness of the composites, compared with the carbon matrix, are 147% and 400%, respectively. Whereas the highest in-plane thermal conductivity of the composites is 86 W m−1 K−1 which much lower than that of carbon matrix (253 W m−1 K−1).At the same time the electrical resistivity of the composites is much higher than that of matrix. It is implicated that CNTs seem to play the role of thermal/electrical barrier in the composites. FSEM micrograph of the fracture surface for the composites shows that the presence of CNTs restrains the crystallite growth of carbon matrix, which is one of factors that improve mechanical properties and decrease the conductive properties of the composites. The defects and curved shape of CNTs are also the affecting factors on the conductive properties of the composites.

Body:
Carbon nanotube (CNT)-based composites are being intensively studied owing to unique physical/mechanical properties of CNTs. CNTs are thought as the ultimate carbon fibers, and expected to have high mechanical, ultra high thermal conductivity and unusual electrical properties [1–6]. At present, more composites have been developed in CNT reinforced polymer, ceramic and metal [7–10]. Despite these composites showing enhancement in strength and stiffness combined with electrical conductivity at relatively low concentration of CNTs, the composites are not as useful as expected due to difficulty in efficient dispersion of CNTs in matrix and weak CNT/matrix bonding. Based on the good compatibility of carbon fiber and carbon matrix, multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) reinforced carbon matrix (MWNT/C) composites have been explored in this letter, trying to develop the new application of CNTs in carbon matrix materials.

The MWNTs (provided by WuHan Iron and Steel Corp., see Fig. 1
                  ) used in the experiment were fabricated by catalysis of hydrocarbon. They are tangled together and their diameters are between 20 and 40 nm. Most of them are not straight and possess some defects and localized kinks and bends.

Considering the high carbon yield of mesophase pitch and excellent pre-orientation, AR mesophase pitch (produced by Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co. Inc., anisotropic content 100%, softening point 280 °C) was chosen as carbon matrix precursor in the present study. In addition, the properties of composites are dependent on the manufacturing method. Therefore, two series MWNT/C composites, C and CP series composites (followed number is wt.% of MWNTs in raw materials), were prepared to better realize the reinforced action of CNTs in carbon matrix.

C series composites were fabricated by the following processes. Firstly, 15∼30 wt.% MWNTs were dispersed in mesophase pitch by melt mixing at about 400 °C after ultrasonic mixing process. Then, the mixture powder was hot-molded under 50 MPa pressure at 320 °C. Next, molded samples were carbonized at 900 °C for 1 h in a nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, the graphitization treatment was performed in argon at 2500 °C for 1 h.

Composites exhibited the unusual behavior during prepared process. Bulk densities, weight change and volumetric contraction of composites are given in Fig. 2
                  , where significant influence of the content of CNTs and heat treatment temperature (HTT) are demonstrated. Great weight loss and volumetric shrinkage were found during the carbonization. There was a small weight loss when the HTT was over 900 °C, while the quantity of volumetric shrinkage still increased up to 2500 °C. In addition, composites showed relatively less weight loss and volumetric shrinkage with the increase of CNTs. Based on the weight loss and volumetric contraction, the densities increased from 1.19, 1.40, 1.33 g/cm3 of 30%, 20%, 15 wt.% CNTs for molded block up to 1.49, 1.82, 1.90 g/cm3 respectively when HTT was elevated to 2500 °C.

Great shrinkage will cause some crack in composites, which maybe decrease the properties of composites. Therefore, CP series composites were fabricated by the same method as C series composites except that there were three general coal tar pitch impregnation /carbonization (PIC) cycles before graphitization to reduce volumetric shrinkage during HTT.

The basic physical properties of C and CP series MWNT/C are summarized in Table 1
                  .To understand the reinforcing role of CNTs, the properties of high purity graphite from AR mesophase pitch coke and mesophase pitch by the same fabrication method as that of CP series composites are also listed.

From these data it can be seen that CNTs can enhance the mechanical properties of carbon matrix effectively. The maximal increment of the bending strength and stiffness of the composites, compared with the graphite, are 147% and 400%, respectively. On the other hand, it is well known that mesophase pitch can form the highly oriented order structure after graphitization that displays extremely high transport properties, and has been chosen as the optimum precursor of high thermal conductivity carbon fiber and carbon foam [12–15]. Therefore, graphite from AR mesophase pitch exhibits high thermal conductivity (253 W m−1 K−1) at room temperature. Whereas, the highest thermal conductivity of composites is 86 W m−1 K−1 and the least thermal conductivity is only 2∼3 W m−1 K−1, much lower than that of the graphite. At the same time the electrical resistivity of composites is much higher than that of the graphite. Furthermore, composites with more CNTs show lower conductivity. It is implicated that CNTs seem to play thermal/electrical barrier in high conduction carbon matrix. In addition, CP series composites exhibit better properties than C series composites.

Fig. 3
                   is the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FSEM) micrograph of the fracture surface for graphite and the resulting composites. From the fracture surface, we can see obviously that large graphite crystallite formed in the graphite material [Fig. 3(a)], and carbon matrix formed very small graphite crystallite in MWNT/C composites [Fig. 3(b)(c)(d)]. This means that the existence of CNTs restrains the crystallite growth of carbon matrix. Moreover, pulling-out of CNTs and some shrinkage crack can be observed in C series MWNT/C [Fig. 3(b)]. Some agglomeration of CNTs is also observed when added relatively more CNTs [Fig. 3(c)]. These indicate that there exist weak interface combination. In addition, CP series MWNT/C are more dense [Fig. 3(d)] and show better properties than C series MWNT/C.

It is well known that high CNTs content will increase the agglomeration of CNTs in the matrix and decrease the MWNT/matrix interfacial adhesion, which made the bonding loose. The loosened bonding will reduce dramatically the density and mechanical/conductive properties of the composites such as C30 (Table1).

The great enhancement in strength and stiffness of composites (except C30) may be attributed to the excellent mechanical properties of CNTs. On the other hand, it was reported that the smaller the graphite grain, the higher the strength of materials [16]. Therefore, it is another factor to improve mechanical properties that CNTs retarded the crystallite growth of carbon matrix.

Based on the good mechanical properties of composites (except C30), the phenomena that CNTs show thermal/electrical barrier in high conduction carbon matrix may come from the following major factors. At first, as far as the conductivity of carbon materials is concerned, smaller graphite crystallites lead to lower thermal conductivity [15]. Hence, it should be responsible for the low conductivity that CNTs retarded the crystallite growth of carbon matrix. Secondly, CNTs are tangled together and curved in composites, and the conductivity character of CNTs is heat transfer along axes direction [17]. Therefore, curved tube may make heat transfer form bow-wave, resulting in the retardation of heat transfer. Thirdly, some defects of CNTs and the poorer tube–tube junction in the bulk sample which caused the volatilization of low molecules and the shrinkage of carbon matrix during prepared process produced low conductivity. Of course, we cannot exclude the fact that the non-ideal dispersion of CNTs in matrix caused low conductivity.

From the above result and analyses, it can be pointed out that there will be greater enhancement in strength and stiffness to MWNT/C composites, and the thermal/electrical conductivity will also be improved when CNTs have better dispersion in matrix and a better combination between CNTs and matrix. In addition, the excellent conductivity of MWNT/C composites will be achieved when the carbon nanotubes are aligned in one direction and optimal CNTs loading are chosen.

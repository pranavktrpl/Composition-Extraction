Title:
Work-hardenable TiZr-based multilayered bulk metallic glass composites through the solid solution strengthening in

Abstract:
To circumvent the trade-off with plasticity and strength, a series of TiZr-based controllable multilayered bulk metallic glass composites (ML-BMGCs), with ex-situ Ti layers and glassy matrix containing precipitated dendrites distribution in an alternate, was fabricated by the hybrid strategy with in-situ and ex-situ. ML-BMGCs exhibit not only enhanced plasticity from 1±0.2% to 8.4±0.2% but also improved the fracture strength from 1643±15 MPa to 1956±20 MPa under compression. The improved strength is attributed to that the solid solution strengthen of Zr in the ex-situ Ti layers by Zr element diffusion from glassy matrix to them is increasing with Zr addition. Ti layers and the in-situ dendrites create a strong barrier for the shear band propagation and generate multiplies of the shear band after solid solution strengthening, thereby which together with the pronouncedly plastic deformation of Ti layers, greatly improves the plastic deformation capacity.

Introduction:
Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have attracted extensive attention, owing to the attractive mechanical properties such as high strength, large elastic limits and high hardness, ect. [1-4]. Unfortunately, BMGs usually fail in an apparently brittle manner during deformation at room temperature due to highly localized adiabatic shear deformation [5-7], severely restricting their application as structural materials. In order to overcome the bottleneck, BMG composites (BMGCs) were designed by introducing the ex-situ crystalline phases or in-situ formed ductile phases into the glassy matrix to hinder the rapid propagation of primary shear band, thus successfully improving the global plasticity [2, 3, 8-11].
As widely recognized that the strength–ductility trade-off has been a longstanding dilemma in materials science, BMGCs have encountered such the similar situation. The mechanical property is strongly affected by the volume fraction, size and spacing, ect. of the crystalline phases besides the glassy matrix. For example, increasing the volume fraction of the ductile crystalline phases generally pronouncedly improves the plasticity but this dramatically decreases their strength of BMGCs [12, 13]. In order to solve this dilemma, many studies have been devoted to adjusting the morphology of the crystalline phases as well as tuning the mechanical properties of the crystalline phases in recent years [10, 14]. Accordingly, the minor addition of β-phase stabilizers has been used to change the growth process of the in-situ formed dendrites and tune the stability of the crystalline phases, which are usually effective to regulate the strength and plasticity of in-situ type BMGCs by stress-induced phase transition [15–18]. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain the uniform microstructure in the as-cast samples owing to the inherently uneven cooling rate from the center to the edge. It is unbeneficial to the improvement of ductility for BMGCs [8]. In contrast, ex-situ type BMGCs attracted extensive attention of researchers due to the advantage of the controllable microstructure. In order to moderate the strength and plasticity, it is more inclined to select a suitable ex-situ phase with high strength to synthesis the BMGCs. However, the ex-situ type BMGCs severely sacrifice their plasticity even reduce dramatically the strength due to the weak bond with ex-situ phases and BMGs. In order to overcome the weakness of the trade-off with strength and plasticity of BMGCs, it is required of exploring a novel strategy to developing a controllable BMGCs with an excellent mechanical property. A novel hybrid strategy with ex-situ and in-situ was successfully proposed to design a series of new controllable multilayered BMGCs (ML-BMGCs) in our previous work [9, 19].
In this work, the aim is to enhance the strength and plasticity of the as-prepared ML-BMGCs by diffusing bcc phase stabilizers from the glassy phase to the ex-situ crystalline phases and strengthening them. It is well known that Zr is used to strengthen many (α+β)-type and β-type commercial titanium alloys [20, 21]. Besides, Ti-Zr alloys are well capable of plastic deformation. Thus, Zr is selected as the microalloying element. It is found out that the plasticity, yield strength and fracture strength were significantly increasing as increasing the Zr content in the metallic glass alloys.

Experimental:
BMGs alloy ingots with nominal compositions of Ti63-xZrxNi5.3Cu9Be22.7 (at.%, x=34, 40, 46 and 52, denoted as Zr34, Zr40, Zr46 and Zr52 BMG, respectively, the corresponding ML-BMGCs denoted as Zr34, Zr40, Zr46 and Zr52 ML-BMGC, respectively) were produced by arc-melting Ti, Zr, Ni, Cu and Be elements (purity > 99.0 wt.%) under a Ti-gettered high-purity argon atmosphere. The glass formation ability of these BMGs is more than 20 mm in diameter. Some thermal parameters of these BMGs are listed in Table 1 . The glassy ribbons with about 40 μm in thickness and 10 mm in width were produced using a melt spinning method. The preforms, with a thickness of 10 mm that the ribbons and commercially pure Ti layers (the purity > 99.9%) with a thickness of 50 μm and width as the glassy ribbons were stacked alternately in a holding fixture, were sealed into a vacuumed stainless steel square tube. Eventually, the ML-BMGCs were fabricated by holding 8 min at 1138 K (the prepare temperature above the liquid temperature of BMGs is to ensure the formation of glassy phases in ML-BMGCs), and then quenching into the water.
The microstructures of both as-cast and fractured ML-BMGCs were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Rigaku D/max2500PC) with Cu-Kα radiation, transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F20) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM; ZEISS Supra 55) equipped with an energy disperse spectrometer (EDS). The compression samples, with a size of 2 mm × 2 mm × 4 mm, were tested on an Electronic Universal Testing Machine (Instron 5582) with the constant strain rate of 0.048 mm/min. At least four samples of each ML-BMGC or BMG were tested. Some thermal parameters was examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Netzsch, Germany, alumina crucible, with a constant heating rate of 20 K/min). The microhardness and modulus of the Ti layers of ML-BMGCs were measured by a nanoindenter (Agilent, G200) in the continuous stiffness mode with a depth of 500 nm and a loading rate of 10 nm⋅s˗1. The Vickers hardness of the sample was measured by a Leco LM247AT Micro-hardness test system with 100 g load and 15 s holding time. The average of nine measurements was used for each data point.

Results And Discussion:
Fig. 1 (a) shows the XRD patterns of the present four ML-BMGCs. A broad peak of glassy matrix superimposed with the crystalline peaks of bcc phases and hcp phases can be seen. Additionally, a sharp peak appears at about 28˚ of the XRD pattern of Zr40 ML-BMGC, which is confirmed as Be2Ti(Zr) [22, 23]. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 1(b) that all the ML-BMGCs present a comparable microstructure with Ti layers and glassy matrix distribution alternately, which realizes the designed multilayered structure. It can be observed from Fig. 1(c-f), the Ti layers become thinner slightly and some dendrites precipitated from the glassy matrix. The dissolution of Ti layers is mainly on account of the concentration difference in both sides of the solid-liquid interface. The dissolution leads to the component fluctuation in the glassy matrix liquid. The dendrites are required to precipitate from the glassy melts aim to insuring the formation of the glassy phases. It is worth mentioning that Zr40 ML-BMGC is an exception, in which the drastic dissolution of Ti layers took place and some black particles appear in the glassy matrix, which corresponds to Be2Ti(Zr) in XRD pattern. Be2Ti(Zr) is a brittle phase, which has a deleterious effect on the final mechanical property. Interestingly, the coarser dendrites and some round glassy phases surrounded by the dendrites were observed. This phenomenon is referred to as the dendrites coarsening [24-26]. The mechanism, coalescence of the dendrite tips and groove advancement leading to entrapment of liquid droplets and tubes, is responsible for the present dendrites coarsening [27, 28].
The average composition of crystalline phases and glassy matrix is hardly to calibrate due to the fact the content of Be element is difficult to measure. However, most of Be is enriched in glassy matrix for Ti-based BMGCs [29]. It can see from Fig. 2 that the compositions of the dendrites and the glassy matrix for the ML-BMGCs change in very narrow with adding Zr except Zr40 ML-BMGC. Therefore, it can reasonably speculate that the excessive Zr (includes Zr40 ML-BMGC) is expected to diffuse to the Ti layers. It means that the higher Zr content, the more stabilizers diffuse to Ti layers, due to the higher concentration difference and that Zr can dissolve indefinitely in hcp phases and bcc phases. Consequently, the solid solution strengthening of Zr in the Ti layers is gradually increasing with adding Zr.
The concentrations of the composition in the dendrites and the glassy matrix are on the same level, while the accumulation degree of Zr in the Ti layers present a gradient change, as shown in Fig. 3 (a), which is prone to a formation of gradient structure [9, 19, 30], as shown in Fig. 3(b-d). A gradient modulus and microhardness in the Ti layers in Fig. 4 (a) suggest a gradient mismatch of the mechanical properties. A stress gradient is expected to distribute in the Ti layers during loading, which contributes to a synergetic deformation to enhance the mechanical property [31]. Most of Cu and Ni being dissolved in the glassy matrix is in line with the previous result [32]. In order to better understand the solid solution mechanism, the Vickers hardness of Ti layers were tested. Fig. 4(b) shows a trend of Vickers hardness with an indentation in width of 20 μm with adding Zr. The Vickers hardness rises from Zr34 ML-BMGC of 283.2±10 Hv to Zr52 ML-BMGC of 463.3±10 Hv, indicating that the solid solution strengthening of ex-situ Ti layers are increasing with Zr addition.
Obviously, the adding Zr leads to a different microstructure of ML-BMGCs especially Zr40 ML-BMGC. In order to find out the origin of the results, it is requirement for concerning the physicochemical properties of liquid metals especially such as the melting temperature and liquid temperature, which has great impact on diffusion process. Fig. 5 displays the DSC curves of the present BMGs at heating rate of 20 K/min. The thermal parameters of the present BMGs are listed in Table 1. It is well known that alloying elements influence greatly the diffusion behavior in the metallic alloys [33, 34]. The alloy melts are at the supercooled state because the prepared temperature is above the liquid temperature (Tl ) of the alloy melts. Once alloying elements leads to the liquid temperature (Tl ) of the alloy melts decrease, the diffusivity increases in the supercooled melts, which will accelerate the diffusion of elements of the supercooled melts. The liquid temperature of Zr40 BMG is markedly lower than that of the others, indicating the diffusion of the supercooled melt for Zr40 BMG is more easy to operate during the interaction between the pure Ti layers and supercooled alloy melts. Consequently, the interdiffusion of Ti and Zr atomic is accelerated for Zr40 ML-BMGC. However, the relatively higher liquid temperature of alloy melts indicates a strong binding between atoms of the supercooled melts for Zr34, Zr46 and Zr52 BMGs. As a result, it is reasonable that the diffusivity of the supercooled melts decreases for Zr34, Zr46 and Zr52 BMGs.
The negentropic model constructed by Spaepen and Thompson has been often used to estimate the interfacial energy of multicomponent system [35]. The temperature-dependent the precipitated crystals-supercooled liquid interfacial energy Δ G L − S , is expressed as [36]: (1) Δ G L − S=τ T Δ S ( N A V 2 ) 1 / 3
Where ΔS, T and N A are the entropy of fusion, the temperature and the Avogadro's number, respectively. τ is a factor depending on the structure difference between the crystals and the supercooled liquid, and it is 0.86 for hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phases, and 0.71 for bcc crystals. V is the molar volume, which is obtained by V=M ρ (where M is the molar weight and ρ is the density of the crystals). Here, the M and ρ for Zr34, Zr40, Zr46 and Zr52 BMGs are 55.78, 58.37, 60.96 and 63.55 g · mo l − 1 , respectively, and 5.23, 5.34, 5.46 and 5.58 g · c m − 3 , respectively. Thus, the calculated V are 10.67, 10.93, 11.16 and 11.39 c m 3 · mo l − 1 , respectively according to M and ρ. It needs to point out that the dendrites precipitated from the liquids are identified as bcc crystals for all ML-BMGCs. The entropy of the supercooled liquid is not known. It is assumed that Δ S f ( Δ S f=Δ H f / T f , where Δ H f and T f are fusion enthalpy and the fusion temperature, respectively, and T f is estimated using the melting peak temperature) is equal to the entropy of the supercooled liquid, thereby the calculated Δ G L − S of Zr34, Zr40, Zr46 and Zr52 BMGs are 12.72 N A 1 / 3 , 6.18 N A 1 / 3 , 12.1 N A 1 / 3 and 12.132 N A 1 / 3 , respectively. Obviously, the Δ G L − S of Zr40 BMG is much less than the others. The lower Δ G L − S is to the benefit of the precipitation and the growth of the dendrite phases, which explains the coarsening dendrites of Zr40 ML-BMGCs compared with the others.
The dissolution is comprised of solvation of the solute molecules at the solid-liquid interface and transport of solvated solute molecules away from the interface [37]. The dissolution quantificationally suggests that the dissolution of Zr40 ML-BMGC is interfacially controlled while the others can be considered to be a diffusion-controlled process. For Zr40 ML-BMGC, due to the lower liquid temperature resulting to increasing diffusion, it is logical to expect that a mass transport of Ti atomic away from the interface and to lead to Ti atomic reaching quickly saturation in the liquid. Inevitably, the increasing new surfaces expose to the liquids due to the interface changing from the smooth to zigzag, which further decreases the solid-liquid interfacial energy. It is required to mention that the coarsening mechanism is controlled by the liquid fraction [24]. When the liquid fraction is relatively high, the liquid acts as the matrix, which encases the dendrites. As for the case of a low fraction of liquid phase, the dendritic coarsening mechanism is dominated by the coalescence. Here, the volume fraction of glassy matrix is assumed as the liquid fraction. Thereby, for Zr34, Zr40, Zr46 and Zr52 ML-BMGCs, the liquid volume fractions are 37.5±2%, 32.6±3%, 39.3±3% and 38.5±2%, respectively (statistical volume fraction results of glassy matrix in present ML-BMGCs). The larger dissolution and the precipitation of the dendrites should trigger the decrease of the volume fraction of the supercooled liquids. The liquid fraction of Zr34, Zr46 and Zr52 ML-BMGCs still maintain a relatively high level even though an existence of the dissolution and precipitation. Their coarsening mechanisms are dominated by the high fraction of supercooled liquid phases. However, the coarsening process is compelled to terminate due to lacking of enough driving force of the nucleation and growth. In comparison with the case of a high fraction of supercooled liquid phases, for Zr40 ML-BMGC with a lower liquid fraction, the coarsening mechanism is fully different. The coalescence by local solidification at liquid grooves between side arms entrapments some droplets in the dendrites.
It can be noticed that Ti has a weakly interaction with Ni, Cu and Be compared with Zr (the mixing enthalpies of Ti-Ni, Ti-Cu and Ti-Be are −35, −9 and −30 kJ/mol, respectively, while for Zr-Cu, Zr-Ni and Zr-Be are −49, −23, and −43 kJ/mol, respectively [38]). That Ti dissolution into the glassy melts and replacing Zr will lead to a decrease of chemical mixing enthalpy in this system, consequently decreasing Gibbs free energy difference between disordered and ordered structure. Thereby, the dendrites are easy to precipitate from the glassy melts. For Zr34, Zr46 and Zr52 ML-BMGCs, Ti layers slightly dissolve into glassy melts, which has little effect on the glassy forming ability of matrix. The formation of some brittle phases such as Be2Ti(Zr) is fully inhibited. The nucleation and growth of the dendrites lack sufficient driving forces. As a result, the less dendrites form in the glassy matrix and they possess the morphologies in fine size. Large amounts of Ti dissolution for Zr40 ML-BMGC is to the benefit of the nucleation and growth of the dendrites. In addition, an excess of the dissolution of Ti modifies absolutely the nature of the alloy melt, and degrades the glass forming ability. As a result, the higher enough cooling rate is required to inhibit the precipitation of the eutectic Be2Ti(Zr) phases. Thereby, it is not surprising that the brittle Be2Ti(Zr) phases exist in the glassy matrix for Zr40 ML-BMGC.
In fact, the solid-liquid interaction involves diffusion process to the solid Ti layers in addition to the dissolution of Ti layers. In order to minimizing the system free energy of glassy melts, it is requirement of the excess of Zr in glassy melts diffuses to Ti layers. The concentration difference in both sides of the solid-liquid interface creates a favorable condition for this diffusion behavior. The diffusion process can be described by Fick's second law [39]: (2) ∂ C ( x , t ) ∂ t=∂ ∂ X ( D ( ∂ C ( x , t ) ∂ X ) )
Where x and t are the space and time coordinate, respectively, ∂ C ( x , t ) ∂ t is the concentration gradient of the mobile component at x and t. D is diffusion coefficient, which is not a function of concentration. Obviously, the higher content of Zr in the glassy melts, the greater driving force of the diffusion. As a consequent, the Zr diffusion rate increases with Zr addition.
When heating to the melt temperature, the dissolution of Ti results in the composition variation in glassy melts. In order to minimize the system free energy, the elements in the melts have to rearranged. Cu, Ni and Be remain almost in the melts, which is conducive to decreasing the system free energy and stabilizing the melts. However, the excess of Zr elements is bad for minimizing the system free energy to form glassy phase and Zr elements can dissolve infinitely into hcp-Ti or bcc-Ti. Thus, the excessive Zr elements either enrich in the dendrites or diffuse into the pure Ti layers.
At t=0, ∂ C ( x , t ) ∂ t is maximum, the driving force of Zr diffusion is enough sufficient. Zr elements are prone to mobile to the pure Ti layers. Zr elements accumulate in a gradient in the Ti layers due to a gradient driving forces in the Ti layers, as show in Fig. 3(a). As time goes by, the accumulation of Zr elements in the Ti layers reaches a certain concentration, the crystal structure transformation from hcp-Ti to bcc-Ti takes place. At this time, the Ti layers transition from single α-Ti layers to the mixtures with hcp-Ti and bcc-Ti phases. The diffusion is no longer single. The closer the solid-liquid interfaces, the more Zr elements accumulate in the Ti layers, which causes bcc-Ti phases distributing along the direction parallel to the solid-liquid interfaces. Zr permeation through the bcc-Ti layers is essential for ensuring the further diffusion in the hcp-Ti layers. It needs to point out that the Zr diffusion coefficient in bcc-phases is larger than that in hcp-Ti phases. The fact is conductive to the further diffusion process. Simultaneously, the boundaries between bcc-Ti and hcp-Ti phases dynamically migrate to the core of the Ti layers. In other word, bcc-Ti layers thickens gradually. The stronger signals of bcc-Ti phases in XRD patterns in Fig. 1(a) indicate the existence of enough bcc-Ti phases.
The diffusion resulting in Zr accumulation in a gradient in the Ti layers (as shown in Fig. 3(a)) causes a complicated microstructure. TEM is used to investigate the microstructure change from the outer to the core of Ti layers along the direction vertical to the interface between glassy matrix and Ti layer, as shown in Fig. 3(b-d). It is observed that the bcc-Ti is connected with glassy matrix and hcp-Ti. Additionally, hcp-Ti presents the morphology from the needle-like structure in the outer to the columnar structure in the core. In other words, the size of hcp-Ti coarsens in a gradient along the Ti layer depth. Such the gradient structure generally causes that the modulus and microhardness present a gradient trend in the whole Ti layers, as show in Fig. 4(a). The gradient mismatch of the mechanical property in such the gradient structure could be better to deliver the stress and harmonize the deformation between every phase, contributing to the high performance under compressive loading.
In the light of the components in the glassy matrix and dendrites for ML-BMGCs, it draws a conclusion that the minimum free energy of the glassy matrix in Zr34, Zr46 and Zr52 ML-BMGCs are close. On the basis of Fick's second law, the driving force of the diffusion is increasing with adding Zr. This results in that the Zr accumulation in the Ti layers is increasing gradually. Zr being added to hcp-Ti or bcc-Ti play a critically role in the solid solution strengthening. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the Vickers hardness in the Ti layers for ML-BMGCs is increasing with adding Zr. The volume fraction of the Ti layers for ML-BMGCs is more than 50%, which confers the solid solution strengthening of Zr in Ti layers playing a decisive role in the mechanical property.
Fig. 6 (a) exhibits the engineering stress–engineering strain cures of the four ML-BMGCs. Some parameters of mechanical property during compressive loading are listed in Table 2 . In order to further analysis, the mechanical property of the present BMGs is also displayed in Fig. 6(b). The BMGs exhibit no significant plasticity and their fracture strength ranges from 1808±20 MPa to 1887±20 MPa. Conclusively, the present BMGs possess similar mechanical property. In contrast, the ML-BMGCs present an obvious difference in the mechanical property. It can be clearly seen that Zr40 ML-BMGC is an abnormity, which presents a trade-off with the plasticity and strength. Zr40 ML-BMGC possesses the maximum yield strength up to 1923±10 MPa and fracture strength of 1982±10 MPa while attains the minimum plasticity of only about 1±0.2%. However, the yield strength and fracture strength of the three other ML-BMGCs are increasing with adding Zr. The strength and plasticity of the most composites are always mutually exclusive [40]. Nevertheless, it is surprising for the present ML-BMGCs except Zr40 ML-BMGC are anomalous with the conventional composites. The ML-BMGCs exhibit a large stress increase after yielding. The similar significant work-hardening phenomenon in Ti/Zr-based BMGCs has been widely reported [12, 15, 41]. The work hardening exponent n is a performance index to characterize the work-hardening behavior of materials during the homogeneous plastic deformation. The values of n can be estimated based on the Hollomon equation [42]: (3) σ=k ε n
Where σ , k and ε are the true stress, strength factor and true strain, respectively. The values of work-hardening index (n) exhibit increasingly changes with Zr addition, as presented by Fig. 6(c). It does not enhance the plasticity at the expense of the strength. Instead, excitingly, not only is the plasticity improved, but also the strength enhanced.
The Zr accumulation in the Ti layers is increasing gradually with increasing Zr, which causes the solid solution strengthening of Zr in Ti layers increasing. The Vickers hardness in the Ti layers for ML-BMGCs increasing with adding Zr loudly demonstrates this conclusion. Consequently, the solid solution strengthening of Zr in Ti layers increasing with Zr addition is responsible for the yield strength, fracture strength and work hardening exponent increasing.
It is well known that plastic deformation of BMGs is accommodated through the generation of multiple shear bands [8, 43]. The crystalline phases in BMGCs are softer than glassy matrix but their hindering the propagation of shear bands and multiplying the shear bands as well as their glide deformation determinedly dominant the mechanical property (especially the plasticity) of BMGCs [6, 9]. Similarly, as for present ML-BMGCs, in encountering the ductile Ti layers, the shear band has to be blocked at the ductile phases and multiplied because of the strong bonding between the ductile Ti layers and the glassy matrix. Therefore, the capacity to resist deformation should be increased by the solid solution strengthening of Ti layers. The solid solution strengthening in Ti layers is attributed to that an excessive Zr rejected by the glassy melt infiltrates to the adjacent Ti layers. Abnormal mechanical property of Zr40 ML-BMGC is responsible by brittle Be2Ti(Zr) phases and the dendrites coarsening. The dendrites coarsening assists the strength enhancement while Be2Ti(Zr) phases deteriorate the plasticity of Zr40 ML-BMGC. As can be seen from Fig. 6(d), multiplied shear bands appear on the lateral surfaces deriving from that the propagation of the primary shear band is hindered by the interfaces between the Ti layers and glassy matrix [9, 19]. That the shear bands are deflected, branched, or multiplied, are beneficial to the improvement of the plasticity. It is noteworthy that some multiple shear bands penetrated the Ti layers and terminated at the Ti layers. The Ti layers and the dendrites are always softer than the glassy matrix, which generates a strong interaction between the softer crystalline phases and the glassy matrix. Additionally, it is clearly seen that vast slid bands appear in the Ti layers, indicating a severe plastic deformation of Ti layers. All these result in an interaction between the glassy matrix and the crystalline phases to obtain an outstanding plasticity. Compared with the others, the number of shear bands and the degree of the deformation of the Ti layers for Zr40 ML-BMGC, shown as in Fig. 6(e), were significantly inferior, suggesting that Zr40 ML-BMGC didn't suffered from a severe deformation.

Conclusions:
In summary, a series of controllable ML-BMGCs with Ti63-xZrxNi5.3Cu9Be22.7/Ti were successfully prepared by the hybrid strategy with in-situ and ex-situ. The ML-BMGCs contain ex-situ hcp phase, in-situ bcc phase and glassy matrix. The morphology of ML-BMGCs is different with Zr addition. The dissolution of Ti layers took place to varying degree after Zr addition. For Zr40 ML-BMGC, a remarkable dissolution of Ti layers occur, additional Be2Ti(Zr) formed and the dendrites coarsening existed. However, Ti layers in the other ML-BMGCs dissolved slightly. The composition in the dendrites and glassy matrix keep approximatively constant with Zr addition, resulting in excessive Zr in the glassy matrix diffusion to adjacent Ti layers. The solid solution strengthening of Zr in ex-situ Ti layers is gradually increasing. ML-BMGCs manifested distinguished work-hardening capability. Zr40 ML-BMGC presents the highest strength including yield strength of 1923±10 MPa and fracture strength of 1982±10 MPa while its plasticity is lowest only of 1±0.2%. Strikingly, the other ML-BMGCs present not only a pronouncedly plasticity (from 5.8±0.1% to 8.4±0.2%) but also a trend of the strength increasing (yield strength and fracture strength range from 1422±15 MPa and 1643±15 MPa to 1552±20 MPa and 1956±20 MPa, respectively) with Zr addition. The ex-situ Ti layers after solid solution strengthening hinder the shear band propagation and multiply shear bands, which is the reason for the improved plasticity and strength. The current work provides a guidance for overcoming the trade-off with plasticity and strength of BMGCs, which sheds lights on the applications of BMGs as engineering materials.

Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have attracted extensive attention, owing to the attractive mechanical properties such as high strength, large elastic limits and high hardness, ect. [1-4]. Unfortunately, BMGs usually fail in an apparently brittle manner during deformation at room temperature due to highly localized adiabatic shear deformation [5-7], severely restricting their application as structural materials. In order to overcome the bottleneck, BMG composites (BMGCs) were designed by introducing the ex-situ crystalline phases or in-situ formed ductile phases into the glassy matrix to hinder the rapid propagation of primary shear band, thus successfully improving the global plasticity [2, 3, 8-11].

As widely recognized that the strength–ductility trade-off has been a longstanding dilemma in materials science, BMGCs have encountered such the similar situation. The mechanical property is strongly affected by the volume fraction, size and spacing, ect. of the crystalline phases besides the glassy matrix. For example, increasing the volume fraction of the ductile crystalline phases generally pronouncedly improves the plasticity but this dramatically decreases their strength of BMGCs [12, 13]. In order to solve this dilemma, many studies have been devoted to adjusting the morphology of the crystalline phases as well as tuning the mechanical properties of the crystalline phases in recent years [10, 14]. Accordingly, the minor addition of β-phase stabilizers has been used to change the growth process of the in-situ formed dendrites and tune the stability of the crystalline phases, which are usually effective to regulate the strength and plasticity of in-situ type BMGCs by stress-induced phase transition [15–18]. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain the uniform microstructure in the as-cast samples owing to the inherently uneven cooling rate from the center to the edge. It is unbeneficial to the improvement of ductility for BMGCs [8]. In contrast, ex-situ type BMGCs attracted extensive attention of researchers due to the advantage of the controllable microstructure. In order to moderate the strength and plasticity, it is more inclined to select a suitable ex-situ phase with high strength to synthesis the BMGCs. However, the ex-situ type BMGCs severely sacrifice their plasticity even reduce dramatically the strength due to the weak bond with ex-situ phases and BMGs. In order to overcome the weakness of the trade-off with strength and plasticity of BMGCs, it is required of exploring a novel strategy to developing a controllable BMGCs with an excellent mechanical property. A novel hybrid strategy with ex-situ and in-situ was successfully proposed to design a series of new controllable multilayered BMGCs (ML-BMGCs) in our previous work [9, 19].

In this work, the aim is to enhance the strength and plasticity of the as-prepared ML-BMGCs by diffusing bcc phase stabilizers from the glassy phase to the ex-situ crystalline phases and strengthening them. It is well known that Zr is used to strengthen many (α+β)-type and β-type commercial titanium alloys [20, 21]. Besides, Ti-Zr alloys are well capable of plastic deformation. Thus, Zr is selected as the microalloying element. It is found out that the plasticity, yield strength and fracture strength were significantly increasing as increasing the Zr content in the metallic glass alloys.

BMGs alloy ingots with nominal compositions of Ti63-xZrxNi5.3Cu9Be22.7 (at.%, x=34, 40, 46 and 52, denoted as Zr34, Zr40, Zr46 and Zr52 BMG, respectively, the corresponding ML-BMGCs denoted as Zr34, Zr40, Zr46 and Zr52 ML-BMGC, respectively) were produced by arc-melting Ti, Zr, Ni, Cu and Be elements (purity > 99.0 wt.%) under a Ti-gettered high-purity argon atmosphere. The glass formation ability of these BMGs is more than 20 mm in diameter. Some thermal parameters of these BMGs are listed in Table 1 . The glassy ribbons with about 40 μm in thickness and 10 mm in width were produced using a melt spinning method. The preforms, with a thickness of 10 mm that the ribbons and commercially pure Ti layers (the purity > 99.9%) with a thickness of 50 μm and width as the glassy ribbons were stacked alternately in a holding fixture, were sealed into a vacuumed stainless steel square tube. Eventually, the ML-BMGCs were fabricated by holding 8 min at 1138 K (the prepare temperature above the liquid temperature of BMGs is to ensure the formation of glassy phases in ML-BMGCs), and then quenching into the water.

The microstructures of both as-cast and fractured ML-BMGCs were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Rigaku D/max2500PC) with Cu-Kα radiation, transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F20) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM; ZEISS Supra 55) equipped with an energy disperse spectrometer (EDS). The compression samples, with a size of 2 mm × 2 mm × 4 mm, were tested on an Electronic Universal Testing Machine (Instron 5582) with the constant strain rate of 0.048 mm/min. At least four samples of each ML-BMGC or BMG were tested. Some thermal parameters was examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Netzsch, Germany, alumina crucible, with a constant heating rate of 20 K/min). The microhardness and modulus of the Ti layers of ML-BMGCs were measured by a nanoindenter (Agilent, G200) in the continuous stiffness mode with a depth of 500 nm and a loading rate of 10 nm⋅s˗1. The Vickers hardness of the sample was measured by a Leco LM247AT Micro-hardness test system with 100 g load and 15 s holding time. The average of nine measurements was used for each data point.

Fig. 1 (a) shows the XRD patterns of the present four ML-BMGCs. A broad peak of glassy matrix superimposed with the crystalline peaks of bcc phases and hcp phases can be seen. Additionally, a sharp peak appears at about 28˚ of the XRD pattern of Zr40 ML-BMGC, which is confirmed as Be2Ti(Zr) [22, 23]. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 1(b) that all the ML-BMGCs present a comparable microstructure with Ti layers and glassy matrix distribution alternately, which realizes the designed multilayered structure. It can be observed from Fig. 1(c-f), the Ti layers become thinner slightly and some dendrites precipitated from the glassy matrix. The dissolution of Ti layers is mainly on account of the concentration difference in both sides of the solid-liquid interface. The dissolution leads to the component fluctuation in the glassy matrix liquid. The dendrites are required to precipitate from the glassy melts aim to insuring the formation of the glassy phases. It is worth mentioning that Zr40 ML-BMGC is an exception, in which the drastic dissolution of Ti layers took place and some black particles appear in the glassy matrix, which corresponds to Be2Ti(Zr) in XRD pattern. Be2Ti(Zr) is a brittle phase, which has a deleterious effect on the final mechanical property. Interestingly, the coarser dendrites and some round glassy phases surrounded by the dendrites were observed. This phenomenon is referred to as the dendrites coarsening [24-26]. The mechanism, coalescence of the dendrite tips and groove advancement leading to entrapment of liquid droplets and tubes, is responsible for the present dendrites coarsening [27, 28].

The average composition of crystalline phases and glassy matrix is hardly to calibrate due to the fact the content of Be element is difficult to measure. However, most of Be is enriched in glassy matrix for Ti-based BMGCs [29]. It can see from Fig. 2 that the compositions of the dendrites and the glassy matrix for the ML-BMGCs change in very narrow with adding Zr except Zr40 ML-BMGC. Therefore, it can reasonably speculate that the excessive Zr (includes Zr40 ML-BMGC) is expected to diffuse to the Ti layers. It means that the higher Zr content, the more stabilizers diffuse to Ti layers, due to the higher concentration difference and that Zr can dissolve indefinitely in hcp phases and bcc phases. Consequently, the solid solution strengthening of Zr in the Ti layers is gradually increasing with adding Zr.

The concentrations of the composition in the dendrites and the glassy matrix are on the same level, while the accumulation degree of Zr in the Ti layers present a gradient change, as shown in Fig. 3 (a), which is prone to a formation of gradient structure [9, 19, 30], as shown in Fig. 3(b-d). A gradient modulus and microhardness in the Ti layers in Fig. 4 (a) suggest a gradient mismatch of the mechanical properties. A stress gradient is expected to distribute in the Ti layers during loading, which contributes to a synergetic deformation to enhance the mechanical property [31]. Most of Cu and Ni being dissolved in the glassy matrix is in line with the previous result [32]. In order to better understand the solid solution mechanism, the Vickers hardness of Ti layers were tested. Fig. 4(b) shows a trend of Vickers hardness with an indentation in width of 20 μm with adding Zr. The Vickers hardness rises from Zr34 ML-BMGC of 283.2±10 Hv to Zr52 ML-BMGC of 463.3±10 Hv, indicating that the solid solution strengthening of ex-situ Ti layers are increasing with Zr addition.

Obviously, the adding Zr leads to a different microstructure of ML-BMGCs especially Zr40 ML-BMGC. In order to find out the origin of the results, it is requirement for concerning the physicochemical properties of liquid metals especially such as the melting temperature and liquid temperature, which has great impact on diffusion process. Fig. 5 displays the DSC curves of the present BMGs at heating rate of 20 K/min. The thermal parameters of the present BMGs are listed in Table 1. It is well known that alloying elements influence greatly the diffusion behavior in the metallic alloys [33, 34]. The alloy melts are at the supercooled state because the prepared temperature is above the liquid temperature (Tl ) of the alloy melts. Once alloying elements leads to the liquid temperature (Tl ) of the alloy melts decrease, the diffusivity increases in the supercooled melts, which will accelerate the diffusion of elements of the supercooled melts. The liquid temperature of Zr40 BMG is markedly lower than that of the others, indicating the diffusion of the supercooled melt for Zr40 BMG is more easy to operate during the interaction between the pure Ti layers and supercooled alloy melts. Consequently, the interdiffusion of Ti and Zr atomic is accelerated for Zr40 ML-BMGC. However, the relatively higher liquid temperature of alloy melts indicates a strong binding between atoms of the supercooled melts for Zr34, Zr46 and Zr52 BMGs. As a result, it is reasonable that the diffusivity of the supercooled melts decreases for Zr34, Zr46 and Zr52 BMGs.

The negentropic model constructed by Spaepen and Thompson has been often used to estimate the interfacial energy of multicomponent system [35]. The temperature-dependent the precipitated crystals-supercooled liquid interfacial energy Δ G L − S , is expressed as [36]: (1) Δ G L − S=τ T Δ S ( N A V 2 ) 1 / 3

Where ΔS, T and N A are the entropy of fusion, the temperature and the Avogadro's number, respectively. τ is a factor depending on the structure difference between the crystals and the supercooled liquid, and it is 0.86 for hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phases, and 0.71 for bcc crystals. V is the molar volume, which is obtained by V=M ρ (where M is the molar weight and ρ is the density of the crystals). Here, the M and ρ for Zr34, Zr40, Zr46 and Zr52 BMGs are 55.78, 58.37, 60.96 and 63.55 g · mo l − 1 , respectively, and 5.23, 5.34, 5.46 and 5.58 g · c m − 3 , respectively. Thus, the calculated V are 10.67, 10.93, 11.16 and 11.39 c m 3 · mo l − 1 , respectively according to M and ρ. It needs to point out that the dendrites precipitated from the liquids are identified as bcc crystals for all ML-BMGCs. The entropy of the supercooled liquid is not known. It is assumed that Δ S f ( Δ S f=Δ H f / T f , where Δ H f and T f are fusion enthalpy and the fusion temperature, respectively, and T f is estimated using the melting peak temperature) is equal to the entropy of the supercooled liquid, thereby the calculated Δ G L − S of Zr34, Zr40, Zr46 and Zr52 BMGs are 12.72 N A 1 / 3 , 6.18 N A 1 / 3 , 12.1 N A 1 / 3 and 12.132 N A 1 / 3 , respectively. Obviously, the Δ G L − S of Zr40 BMG is much less than the others. The lower Δ G L − S is to the benefit of the precipitation and the growth of the dendrite phases, which explains the coarsening dendrites of Zr40 ML-BMGCs compared with the others.

The dissolution is comprised of solvation of the solute molecules at the solid-liquid interface and transport of solvated solute molecules away from the interface [37]. The dissolution quantificationally suggests that the dissolution of Zr40 ML-BMGC is interfacially controlled while the others can be considered to be a diffusion-controlled process. For Zr40 ML-BMGC, due to the lower liquid temperature resulting to increasing diffusion, it is logical to expect that a mass transport of Ti atomic away from the interface and to lead to Ti atomic reaching quickly saturation in the liquid. Inevitably, the increasing new surfaces expose to the liquids due to the interface changing from the smooth to zigzag, which further decreases the solid-liquid interfacial energy. It is required to mention that the coarsening mechanism is controlled by the liquid fraction [24]. When the liquid fraction is relatively high, the liquid acts as the matrix, which encases the dendrites. As for the case of a low fraction of liquid phase, the dendritic coarsening mechanism is dominated by the coalescence. Here, the volume fraction of glassy matrix is assumed as the liquid fraction. Thereby, for Zr34, Zr40, Zr46 and Zr52 ML-BMGCs, the liquid volume fractions are 37.5±2%, 32.6±3%, 39.3±3% and 38.5±2%, respectively (statistical volume fraction results of glassy matrix in present ML-BMGCs). The larger dissolution and the precipitation of the dendrites should trigger the decrease of the volume fraction of the supercooled liquids. The liquid fraction of Zr34, Zr46 and Zr52 ML-BMGCs still maintain a relatively high level even though an existence of the dissolution and precipitation. Their coarsening mechanisms are dominated by the high fraction of supercooled liquid phases. However, the coarsening process is compelled to terminate due to lacking of enough driving force of the nucleation and growth. In comparison with the case of a high fraction of supercooled liquid phases, for Zr40 ML-BMGC with a lower liquid fraction, the coarsening mechanism is fully different. The coalescence by local solidification at liquid grooves between side arms entrapments some droplets in the dendrites.

It can be noticed that Ti has a weakly interaction with Ni, Cu and Be compared with Zr (the mixing enthalpies of Ti-Ni, Ti-Cu and Ti-Be are −35, −9 and −30 kJ/mol, respectively, while for Zr-Cu, Zr-Ni and Zr-Be are −49, −23, and −43 kJ/mol, respectively [38]). That Ti dissolution into the glassy melts and replacing Zr will lead to a decrease of chemical mixing enthalpy in this system, consequently decreasing Gibbs free energy difference between disordered and ordered structure. Thereby, the dendrites are easy to precipitate from the glassy melts. For Zr34, Zr46 and Zr52 ML-BMGCs, Ti layers slightly dissolve into glassy melts, which has little effect on the glassy forming ability of matrix. The formation of some brittle phases such as Be2Ti(Zr) is fully inhibited. The nucleation and growth of the dendrites lack sufficient driving forces. As a result, the less dendrites form in the glassy matrix and they possess the morphologies in fine size. Large amounts of Ti dissolution for Zr40 ML-BMGC is to the benefit of the nucleation and growth of the dendrites. In addition, an excess of the dissolution of Ti modifies absolutely the nature of the alloy melt, and degrades the glass forming ability. As a result, the higher enough cooling rate is required to inhibit the precipitation of the eutectic Be2Ti(Zr) phases. Thereby, it is not surprising that the brittle Be2Ti(Zr) phases exist in the glassy matrix for Zr40 ML-BMGC.

In fact, the solid-liquid interaction involves diffusion process to the solid Ti layers in addition to the dissolution of Ti layers. In order to minimizing the system free energy of glassy melts, it is requirement of the excess of Zr in glassy melts diffuses to Ti layers. The concentration difference in both sides of the solid-liquid interface creates a favorable condition for this diffusion behavior. The diffusion process can be described by Fick's second law [39]: (2) ∂ C ( x , t ) ∂ t=∂ ∂ X ( D ( ∂ C ( x , t ) ∂ X ) )

Where x and t are the space and time coordinate, respectively, ∂ C ( x , t ) ∂ t is the concentration gradient of the mobile component at x and t. D is diffusion coefficient, which is not a function of concentration. Obviously, the higher content of Zr in the glassy melts, the greater driving force of the diffusion. As a consequent, the Zr diffusion rate increases with Zr addition.

When heating to the melt temperature, the dissolution of Ti results in the composition variation in glassy melts. In order to minimize the system free energy, the elements in the melts have to rearranged. Cu, Ni and Be remain almost in the melts, which is conducive to decreasing the system free energy and stabilizing the melts. However, the excess of Zr elements is bad for minimizing the system free energy to form glassy phase and Zr elements can dissolve infinitely into hcp-Ti or bcc-Ti. Thus, the excessive Zr elements either enrich in the dendrites or diffuse into the pure Ti layers.

At t=0, ∂ C ( x , t ) ∂ t is maximum, the driving force of Zr diffusion is enough sufficient. Zr elements are prone to mobile to the pure Ti layers. Zr elements accumulate in a gradient in the Ti layers due to a gradient driving forces in the Ti layers, as show in Fig. 3(a). As time goes by, the accumulation of Zr elements in the Ti layers reaches a certain concentration, the crystal structure transformation from hcp-Ti to bcc-Ti takes place. At this time, the Ti layers transition from single α-Ti layers to the mixtures with hcp-Ti and bcc-Ti phases. The diffusion is no longer single. The closer the solid-liquid interfaces, the more Zr elements accumulate in the Ti layers, which causes bcc-Ti phases distributing along the direction parallel to the solid-liquid interfaces. Zr permeation through the bcc-Ti layers is essential for ensuring the further diffusion in the hcp-Ti layers. It needs to point out that the Zr diffusion coefficient in bcc-phases is larger than that in hcp-Ti phases. The fact is conductive to the further diffusion process. Simultaneously, the boundaries between bcc-Ti and hcp-Ti phases dynamically migrate to the core of the Ti layers. In other word, bcc-Ti layers thickens gradually. The stronger signals of bcc-Ti phases in XRD patterns in Fig. 1(a) indicate the existence of enough bcc-Ti phases.

The diffusion resulting in Zr accumulation in a gradient in the Ti layers (as shown in Fig. 3(a)) causes a complicated microstructure. TEM is used to investigate the microstructure change from the outer to the core of Ti layers along the direction vertical to the interface between glassy matrix and Ti layer, as shown in Fig. 3(b-d). It is observed that the bcc-Ti is connected with glassy matrix and hcp-Ti. Additionally, hcp-Ti presents the morphology from the needle-like structure in the outer to the columnar structure in the core. In other words, the size of hcp-Ti coarsens in a gradient along the Ti layer depth. Such the gradient structure generally causes that the modulus and microhardness present a gradient trend in the whole Ti layers, as show in Fig. 4(a). The gradient mismatch of the mechanical property in such the gradient structure could be better to deliver the stress and harmonize the deformation between every phase, contributing to the high performance under compressive loading.

In the light of the components in the glassy matrix and dendrites for ML-BMGCs, it draws a conclusion that the minimum free energy of the glassy matrix in Zr34, Zr46 and Zr52 ML-BMGCs are close. On the basis of Fick's second law, the driving force of the diffusion is increasing with adding Zr. This results in that the Zr accumulation in the Ti layers is increasing gradually. Zr being added to hcp-Ti or bcc-Ti play a critically role in the solid solution strengthening. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the Vickers hardness in the Ti layers for ML-BMGCs is increasing with adding Zr. The volume fraction of the Ti layers for ML-BMGCs is more than 50%, which confers the solid solution strengthening of Zr in Ti layers playing a decisive role in the mechanical property.

Fig. 6 (a) exhibits the engineering stress–engineering strain cures of the four ML-BMGCs. Some parameters of mechanical property during compressive loading are listed in Table 2 . In order to further analysis, the mechanical property of the present BMGs is also displayed in Fig. 6(b). The BMGs exhibit no significant plasticity and their fracture strength ranges from 1808±20 MPa to 1887±20 MPa. Conclusively, the present BMGs possess similar mechanical property. In contrast, the ML-BMGCs present an obvious difference in the mechanical property. It can be clearly seen that Zr40 ML-BMGC is an abnormity, which presents a trade-off with the plasticity and strength. Zr40 ML-BMGC possesses the maximum yield strength up to 1923±10 MPa and fracture strength of 1982±10 MPa while attains the minimum plasticity of only about 1±0.2%. However, the yield strength and fracture strength of the three other ML-BMGCs are increasing with adding Zr. The strength and plasticity of the most composites are always mutually exclusive [40]. Nevertheless, it is surprising for the present ML-BMGCs except Zr40 ML-BMGC are anomalous with the conventional composites. The ML-BMGCs exhibit a large stress increase after yielding. The similar significant work-hardening phenomenon in Ti/Zr-based BMGCs has been widely reported [12, 15, 41]. The work hardening exponent n is a performance index to characterize the work-hardening behavior of materials during the homogeneous plastic deformation. The values of n can be estimated based on the Hollomon equation [42]: (3) σ=k ε n

Where σ , k and ε are the true stress, strength factor and true strain, respectively. The values of work-hardening index (n) exhibit increasingly changes with Zr addition, as presented by Fig. 6(c). It does not enhance the plasticity at the expense of the strength. Instead, excitingly, not only is the plasticity improved, but also the strength enhanced.

The Zr accumulation in the Ti layers is increasing gradually with increasing Zr, which causes the solid solution strengthening of Zr in Ti layers increasing. The Vickers hardness in the Ti layers for ML-BMGCs increasing with adding Zr loudly demonstrates this conclusion. Consequently, the solid solution strengthening of Zr in Ti layers increasing with Zr addition is responsible for the yield strength, fracture strength and work hardening exponent increasing.

It is well known that plastic deformation of BMGs is accommodated through the generation of multiple shear bands [8, 43]. The crystalline phases in BMGCs are softer than glassy matrix but their hindering the propagation of shear bands and multiplying the shear bands as well as their glide deformation determinedly dominant the mechanical property (especially the plasticity) of BMGCs [6, 9]. Similarly, as for present ML-BMGCs, in encountering the ductile Ti layers, the shear band has to be blocked at the ductile phases and multiplied because of the strong bonding between the ductile Ti layers and the glassy matrix. Therefore, the capacity to resist deformation should be increased by the solid solution strengthening of Ti layers. The solid solution strengthening in Ti layers is attributed to that an excessive Zr rejected by the glassy melt infiltrates to the adjacent Ti layers. Abnormal mechanical property of Zr40 ML-BMGC is responsible by brittle Be2Ti(Zr) phases and the dendrites coarsening. The dendrites coarsening assists the strength enhancement while Be2Ti(Zr) phases deteriorate the plasticity of Zr40 ML-BMGC. As can be seen from Fig. 6(d), multiplied shear bands appear on the lateral surfaces deriving from that the propagation of the primary shear band is hindered by the interfaces between the Ti layers and glassy matrix [9, 19]. That the shear bands are deflected, branched, or multiplied, are beneficial to the improvement of the plasticity. It is noteworthy that some multiple shear bands penetrated the Ti layers and terminated at the Ti layers. The Ti layers and the dendrites are always softer than the glassy matrix, which generates a strong interaction between the softer crystalline phases and the glassy matrix. Additionally, it is clearly seen that vast slid bands appear in the Ti layers, indicating a severe plastic deformation of Ti layers. All these result in an interaction between the glassy matrix and the crystalline phases to obtain an outstanding plasticity. Compared with the others, the number of shear bands and the degree of the deformation of the Ti layers for Zr40 ML-BMGC, shown as in Fig. 6(e), were significantly inferior, suggesting that Zr40 ML-BMGC didn't suffered from a severe deformation.

In summary, a series of controllable ML-BMGCs with Ti63-xZrxNi5.3Cu9Be22.7/Ti were successfully prepared by the hybrid strategy with in-situ and ex-situ. The ML-BMGCs contain ex-situ hcp phase, in-situ bcc phase and glassy matrix. The morphology of ML-BMGCs is different with Zr addition. The dissolution of Ti layers took place to varying degree after Zr addition. For Zr40 ML-BMGC, a remarkable dissolution of Ti layers occur, additional Be2Ti(Zr) formed and the dendrites coarsening existed. However, Ti layers in the other ML-BMGCs dissolved slightly. The composition in the dendrites and glassy matrix keep approximatively constant with Zr addition, resulting in excessive Zr in the glassy matrix diffusion to adjacent Ti layers. The solid solution strengthening of Zr in ex-situ Ti layers is gradually increasing. ML-BMGCs manifested distinguished work-hardening capability. Zr40 ML-BMGC presents the highest strength including yield strength of 1923±10 MPa and fracture strength of 1982±10 MPa while its plasticity is lowest only of 1±0.2%. Strikingly, the other ML-BMGCs present not only a pronouncedly plasticity (from 5.8±0.1% to 8.4±0.2%) but also a trend of the strength increasing (yield strength and fracture strength range from 1422±15 MPa and 1643±15 MPa to 1552±20 MPa and 1956±20 MPa, respectively) with Zr addition. The ex-situ Ti layers after solid solution strengthening hinder the shear band propagation and multiply shear bands, which is the reason for the improved plasticity and strength. The current work provides a guidance for overcoming the trade-off with plasticity and strength of BMGCs, which sheds lights on the applications of BMGs as engineering materials.

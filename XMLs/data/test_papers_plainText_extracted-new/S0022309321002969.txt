Title:
Broadband NIR emission at 1.53 μm in trivalent erbium ions doped SrO-Al

Abstract:
A new series of Er3+ ions doped Oxy Chloro Boro Tellurite glasses were prepared by melt-quenching method. Various spectroscopic properties were determined from absorption, excitation and photo-luminescence spectra. The Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters Ωλ(λ=2,4,6) were estimated based on absorption spectra. A strong luminescence band was observed at 1536nm under the excitation wavelength of 522nm. The gain coefficient of 1.53μm emission was estimated to probe the utility of glasses in broad band amplification technology. Inokuti-Hirayama model was employed to decay curves, to comprehend the nature of energy transfer between erbium ions. The stimulated emission cross-sections (σsec), branching ratios (βR), quantum efficiencies (η%) and gain cross-section (σsecxτR) for Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses were evaluated and compared with other reported glass samples. Based on the highest stimulated emission cross-section, branching ratios, quantum efficiencies and gain cross-sections, it is suggested that 1mol% of Er3+ ions doped OCBT glass is more suitable for NIR region optical device applications.

Introduction:
In recent years, researchers are showing great interest towards the optical materials, in order to address the technological challenges in the platform of photoluminescence device utility in solid state lasers, opto electronic devices, optical unit displays, optical amplifiers, up-conversion and down conversion amplifiers and many more [1]. It is well notable that the concentration, dissemination of rare earth ions and local environment of parent glass matrix holds the positive effect in flourishing the luminescence features like emission cross section, intensity, average life span and spectral line width. Hence, these characteristics are considered as the salient features in choice of rare earth ions doped glasses for luminescence device applications [2]. In terms of oxide glasses, borate glasses are considered as noted materials by their stupendous physical and optical properties such as optical transparency, low melting point, good rare earth ion solubility, high chemical and thermal stability and different coordination number [3]. Boron trioxide is a fine glass former that owns the ability to exist in both 3 & 4-coordinated environment with strong covalent B-O bond and is capable to form stable glasses. The only demerit is stretching vibrations produced in oxide glasses results in the exhibition of elevated phonon energies (~1400cm−1) and low refractive index [4], which ultimately leads to non radiative process via multiphonon relaxation mechanisms, which further shows negative impact in rare earth (RE3+) ion photo luminescence and curbs the wide utility of borate glasses in photonic device applications. This demerit can be retrieved by treating the borate glasses with heavy metal oxides with low phonon energies, such as TeO2 (<800cm−1). TeO2 shows transmission region between 0.3-1.6μm and the glass gets stability by the activation of TeO2 into the host glass matrix [5]. The dopant Al2O3 brings high strength, hardness and outstanding thermal resistance to the host matrix [6]. The geometric allocation of RE elements can be accomplished by the addition of Al2O3 in order to prevent the clustering among them, which in turn improves the quality of the optical devices and finds wide practical application like optical lenses and windows, optical waveguides, antireflection coatings and many more [7]. The dopant BaCl2 makes the host glass transparent in IR region [8]. Addition of SrO brings structural stability in the host matrix [9]. The addition of modifiers to the host glass brings structural changes, such as transition of BO3 units into BO4 units and the structure becomes more open due to the non-bridging oxygen atoms enhancement. Due to its good rare earth ion solubility and flexible structure, borate glasses are emerging as potential materials for fabrication of new luminescent device [10] such as lasers, solar up-converters, optical amplifiers, thermo luminescence dosimeters and emission devices [11]. All these applications of borate glasses are possible because of their random structure and excellent optical properties. The radiative quantum efficiency and lifetime are the two vital parameters of the host glass for exhibition of numerous applications. But for attaining good optical properties, the intensity of emission color and proper doping of RE ions in glasses becomes important aspect [12]
                     
                        .
Quite recently, up-convert materials are gaining much attention because it owes capability of converting infrared light to visible light and perceives noticeable applications like color displays, optoelectronic devices, fiber amplifiers, optical data storage and under water optical communications [13]
                     
                        
                           .
                           
                        
                     Now-a-days wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology is showing tremendous utility in telecommunications because, it transfers large amount of optical data for longer distance. So, broadband fiber amplifiers are the prominent devices in manufacturing the luminescence exhibiting materials between 1200nm to 2600nm. To consummate broad band utility, the host glass should be activated by RE ions. Among various lanthanide ions, Er3+ is one of the significant candidates with metastable energy levels with long lifetime and large absorption cross section at 980 nm. It evinces light in visible and NIR region at 1.5μm by exciting the band at 980nm [14]. The most important characteristic feature of Er3+ ions in infrared (NIR) emission at 1.5 μm through the 4I13/2→4I15/2 transition and finds numerous applications in telecommunication such as frequency up-conversion lasers, waveguide lasers, waveguide amplifiers, eye safe laser systems, full color solid state displays, wave length division multiplexing (WDM), network system, erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) and lidar transmitters [15]. The current work is mainly focused on the physical and spectroscopic properties of erbium ion doped oxy chloro boro tellurite glasses, which unquestionably exist their application in the platform of technologies like solid state lasers and erbium doped fiber amplifiers etc.

The raw chemicals are weighed according to the base composition and were grinded well in a agate mortar to get fine and homogeneous powder. The fine mixture is taken in to the silica crucibles and kept in an electrical furnace for 1 hour in order to get molten melt. Subsequently the molten mixture was quenched by pouring in on a preheated brass plate and pressed against them by another brass plate. The formed transparent glass samples were annealed for 2 hours to wipe the bubbles formed in it. The obtained glass samples were cut and polished for optical characterization.

                     Evaluation of Physical properties
                     The various physical properties accessed for the Er3+ ions doped OCBT glass samples are refractive index (nd), density (n), Average molecular weight(M), Er3+ ion concentration(N), molar volume (Vm), mean atomic volume, molar refraction (Rm), dielectric constant(ε), optical dielectric constant (ε-1), linear dielectric susceptibility(χ), reflection losses(RL), transmission coefficient (T), polaron radius (rp), interatomic distance(ri), molar polarizability (αm), molar electronic polarizability (αme), electronic polarizability (αe), field strength(F), metallization factor (M), oxygen packing density (O.P.D) and average boron-boron separation(d<B-B>). All these physical parameters were determined from the expressions available in literature [16, 17]. From Table. 1
                         it is clearly observed that the values refractive index tends to decline with the raise of Er3+ ion concentration, because the merging of Er3+ ions into host glass leads to reduction of non-bridging oxygen atoms by connecting the bonds between O2− and Er3+ ions. The density tends to increase with Er2O3 concentration because of increasing number of Er3+ ions per unit volume. The variation between refractive index and density with Er3+ ion concentration is depicted in Fig. 1
                        . Mean atomic volume tends to increase with the rise of Er2O3 concentration due to decrease of inter nuclear distance among the atoms and helps in bringing compactness in the glass network [18]. The variation between molar atomic volume and inter ionic distance with increase of Er2O3 is visualized in Fig. 2.
                         The durability, strength of the glass and transformation of BO3 units into BO4 units can be confirmed by the increase of field strength values. The polaron radius and field strength are inversely proportional to each other and their relation is depicted in Fig. 3
                        . The evaluated metallization values are less than one. So, the prepared glass samples possess insulating nature ranging between the values 0.3236-0.3363 and it is evident from the literature that B2O3, alkaline oxides, SiO2 and alkaline earth-oxide based glasses exhibit metallization criterion in the range of 0.50-0.70 [19]

                     Analysis of Absorption spectra and measurement of JO-Intensity parameters
                     
                        Fig. 4
                        . indicates the absorption spectra of Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses. The spectra reveal non-uniform peaks recorded between wavelength region 300 nm and 1700 nm. The ground state of Er2O3 is 4I15/2. The absorption takes from the lower state 4I15/2 to various excited states like 4G9/2, 4G11/2, (2G,4F, 2H)9/2, 4F5/2, 4F7/2, 2H11/2, 4F9/2, 4I9/2, 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 corresponding to 364, 380, 406, 450, 490, 523, 651, 796, 977, 1536 nm respectively due to electrostatic and spin orbit interactions that exists between 4f-4f energy levels of Er3+ ions. The electronic transitions were allotted to the existing absorption peaks as per the procedure given in Carnal et.al [24]. Fig. 4. clearly visualizes that as Er3+ ion concentration increases, the intensity of absorption bands tends to increase and the electronic transitions 4G15/2→4G11/2 and 4G15/2→2H11/2 possess maximum intensity centered at 380, 523 nm. Hence known as hypersensitive transitions and obeys selection rules, ΔJ=2, ΔL=2 and ΔS=0 [25]. These hypersensitive transitions were treated as the characteristics of the host glass network because they are very responsive to their environ [26]. The large matrix values offered by these transitions urge maximum high intensity and this maximum intensity is proportional to

                        . From Table. 2, it is clear that short range magnitude of (δrms) values represents a good quality fit exits between experimental and calculated oscillator strengths of Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses. The covalent or ionic nature of OCBTEr glasses can be known by nephelauxetic ratios (β) and bonding parameters (δ) and were evaluated by using the expression available in the literature [30]. The positive integer represents the covalent nature and negative integers represents the ionic nature of the parent glass. The bonding parameters for the present series prepared glasses are tends to be negative and were -0.00098, -0.00107, -0.00037, -0.00116, -0.00057, -0.00115 for OCBTEr0.1, OCBTEr0.5, OCBTEr1.0, OCBTEr1.5, OCBTEr2.0 and OCBTEr2.5 respectively and represented in Table. 2. Among all the prepared OCBTEr glasses, OCBTEr1.0 glass sample exhibits highest experimental oscillator strength (fexp) and these values are compared with the other reported glasses doped with Er3+ ions [31-35] and are shown in Table. 3
                        .
                     The local network structure around the rare earth ion can be figure out by the J-O intensity parameter. The parameter Ω2 detects the structural symmetry and nature of metal ligand bond. The other two parameters Ω4 and Ω6 discloses about rigidity and viscosity, basicity, dielectric media, which depicts the bond between ligand atoms and erbium ions [36], vibronic transitions around the host glass matrix [37]. The parameter Ω6 corresponds to the isomer shift (IS), which specifies the 6s electron density of RE3+ion. Ω6 with larger values obtains large emission bandwidth and spontaneous radiative probability of RE3+ions [31]. In the current work, J-O intensity parameters are following the trend as Ω6>Ω2>Ω4. Hence the Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses possess properties like both structural symmetry and rigidity. The measured J-O intensity parameters are reported in Table. 4
                        , along with other reported values [14, 31, 32, 38-44] and graphical relation between three intensity parameter Ω2, Ω4 and Ω6 is depicted in Fig. 5

                     Use of J-O parameters in the evaluation of radiative properties analysis
                     The radiative properties such as radiative transition probability (Aτ), branching ratio (βR) and radiative lifetime (τrad) of the parent glass have been measured from the J-O intensity parameters (Ωλ=2,4,6) by utilizing the expressions [45]. Moreover, the emission line strengths related to the transitions from the upper multiplet manifolds 2S+1LJ relative to the lower multiplet manifolds of the erbium (Er3+) ions of the host glass matrix can be evaluated by using the JO intensity parameters. The emission transition 4I13/2→4I15/2 of Er3+ion possesses both magnetic and electric dipole moments. The magnetic dipole parameter doesn't depend on the ligand field, but it is responsible to the origin of intensified peak 4I13/2→4I15/2. The magnetic dipole(Smd) line strength is generally considered as the characteristic of transition, which can be evaluated by using quantum numbers and can affect the emission properties of electric dipole transition(Sed). By using J-O parameters, the line strength of electric dipole transition can be measured by the expression (Sed) (4I13/2→4I15/2) = 0.0195Ω2+0.1172Ω4+1.4325Ω6 and is dependent on structure of host glass matrix [46].

                         represents the optical band gap of direct allowed and indirect allowed transitions of Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses. By utilizing absorption spectral data, the optical band gap energy was evaluated by the expression given by Davis and Mott [47].

                     Here α denotes absorption coefficient, hv represents photon energy, A is the proportionality constant, Eg is the optical bandgap energy and n signifies transition number. As the absorption spectra is processed by direct allowed transition, then n refers to ½ and if it is administered by indirect allowed transitions, then n value is 2. The optical bandgap energy values for allowed direct transitions were obtained by drawing the tangent along the linear slope of curve of (αhν)=0 in the plot of (αhν)2 verses hν. Similarly, the optical bandgap energy values for indirect allowed transitions were measured by extrapolating the tangent on linear part of the curve of (αhν)1/2 =0 in the plot of (αhν)1/2 verses hν. Below the absorption edge, the absorption coefficient varies exponentially with the photon energy which represents the existence of Urbach tail. The Urbach tail appears due to disorderedness in the prepared OCBTEr3+ glasses. The phonon assisted indirect transitions are also responsible for the exponential tail of the absorption edge, which in turn leads to generation of Urbach's energy. The exponential absorption tail and the Urbach's energy are interconnected by using the below expression.

                        . The optical bandgap energies (Eg) of both direct allowed and indirect allowed transitions are tends to increase with increase of Er3+ ion concentration and vary in between 3.45 eV to 3.80 eV for direct allowed and 3.96 eV to 4.17eV for indirect allowed transitions. This increasing nature of bandgap energies indicates the decrease of disorderness in the host glass structure [48] and the Variation of direct and indirect allowed transitions with Er3+ ions concentration is shown in Fig. 9

                         illustrates the excitation spectrum of 1.0 mol% of OCBTEr glass. The excitation spectrum is recorded at an emission wavelength of 1536 nm between wavelength region 300 nm and 1000 nm. Among all excitation bands, the band centered at 522 nm possesses highest intensity. So this excitation transition is used to record the emission spectra in the NIR region. Fig. 11
                         indicates the NIR-emission spectra of Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses. NIR-spectra were recorded between 1400 nm to 1650 nm. All the OCBTEr3+ glasses exhibit only one emission band in NIR-region around 1536 nm (4I13/2→4I15/2) and is inhomogeneity in nature. The transition 4I13/2 →4I15/2 obeys the selection rule ΔS=ΔL=0, ΔJ=+1 because it exhibits both electric and magnetic dipole transitions [49]. The radiative properties such as full width half maxima (FWHM)

To identify any material for active lasing media and broadband amplifiers, the spectroscopic properties of any host matrix like stimulated emission cross-section (σsec), full width at half maxima (FWHM) and effective bandwidth (Δλeff), emission cross-section (σsec) are necessary [32]. The stimulated emission cross-section (σsec) is considered as one of the vital parameters in finding application in optical fibre technology and is evaluated by the expression [50, 51]. Another parameter to have application in the field of optical amplifier is figure of merit (FOM) (FWHMxσsec). The higher values of stimulated emission cross-section indicates the large gain laser operation and low threshold value. In present work OCBTEr1.0 glass shows the higher magnitude of stimulated emission cross-section value.

                        for the transition 4I13/2→4I15/2 finds their usage in the EDFA technology. The vital parameter gain cross-section G(λ) helps in detecting the utility of prepared OCBTEr glasses as EDFA. The transition lies in between two states of ions represents the transition probability and is proportional to absorption cross-section with an incident of photon energy. The absorption cross-section of OCBTEr glasses for the transition 4I13/2→ 4I15/2 can be computed by using the following expression [52].

                        . illustrates the gain cross section spectrum of OCBTEr1.0 glass which plotted in between wavelength and population inversion coefficients. This Fig. 12, clearly depicts that positive gain for γ > 0.5. This is an indication for population inversion getting its value more than 50% in the OCBTEr1.0 glass which is a notation for having the “flat gain bandwidth in the C band (1530-1564 nm range)” i.e. closely in the optical communication window [55]. Hence OCBTEr1.0 glass is considered as an apt material for 1536 nm laser operation, optical communication window and also for WDM and EDFA applications.

                     Energy levels scheme
                     The partial energy level diagram indicating energy transfer mechanisms, cross relaxation mechanisms of Er3+ ions in OCBT glasses are shown in Fig. 14
                        . The Er3+ ions are excited at an wavelength of 522 nm and monitored emission spectra at an emission wavelength of 1536 nm . The energy transfer among the Er3+ ions takes place in, as one of the important quenching centre caused due to migration of Er3+ ions through the resonant energy transfer between Er3+ ions. The cross-relaxation channels (CN) responsible for the luminescence quenching observed beyond 1 mol% of Er3+ ions concentration are as follows:

                     Decay lifetime analysis
                     In order to analyze the energy transfer characteristics of OCBT glasses activated with Er3+ ions, the average decay lifetime (τexp) of the transition 4I13/2→4I15/2 is calculated for all the prepared OCBTEr glasses by observing the fluorescence decay curve of Er3+ ions at an excitation wavelength of 522nm and an emission wavelength of 1536nm is visualized in Fig. 15
                        . All the measured experimental lifetime of OCBTEr0.1, OCBBTEr0.5, OCBTEr1.0, OCBTEr1.5, OCBTEr2.0 and OCBTEr2.5 glass samples were depicted in Table. 6
                         and well fitted with single exponential function. The average lifetime of Er3+ ions were calculated by making use of the following expression [56].

                     Here I(t) represents the intensity at any instant time t . From Fig. 11, it is clearly noticed that as Er3+ ions concentration increases, the decay lifetime is prone to decrease. The experimental lifetime (τexp) of Er3+ ions in OCBT glasses were in good agreement with the radiative lifetime (τrad) values measured from the J-O theory. The experimental lifetime (τexp) can be expressed as [57,58].

                     Where WNR is the non-radiative decay rates that arises due to energy transfer exists between the Er3+ ions and the adjacent pairs of energy levels, WMPR is the also non-radiative decay rate that arise due to multi-phonon relaxation rates exists between Er3+ ions in present glass matrix and WOH is the energy transfer rate which occur between Er3+ ions and OH groups in the host glass matrix [39]. Among all the prepared glass samples, OCBTEr1.0 glass exhibits lowest non-radiative transition rate as 23.32 μs−1, hence it flourishes high quantum efficiency. The rate of energy transfer (ET) depends strongly on rare earth (RE3+) ion concentration and moreover the small variation between experimental (τexp) and radiative (τrad) lifetimes is due to non-radiative relaxation rates exists between Er3+ ions in the higher excited states of the host glass matrix. The ratio of experimental lifetime and calculated radiative lifetime (τexp/τR) gives rise to quantum efficiency (η) of OCBTEr3+ glasses and the efficiency of the OCBTEr1.0 possess highest quantum efficiency and is equal to 90%. Radiative Transition probability (AR)(S−1), branching ratios (βR), effective bandwidth (Δλp)(nm), Stimulated emission cross section (σsecx10−21) (cm2) gain bandwidth (σsecxΔλp10−27cm3), optical gain (σsecxτR)(1018cm2s), radiative lifetime (τR)(ms), experimental lifetimes (τR)(ms), quantum efficiency (η%) and non-radiative transition rates (WNR) for the transition 4I13/2→4I15/2 in Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses are represented in Table. 6.
                     Comparison of Full width at half maximum (FWHM, nm), stimulated emission cross-section (σsec), lifetime (τexp), optical gain (σsecxτexp) and quantum efficiency (η%) of OCBTEr1.0 glass for the transition 4I13/2→4I15/2 with other reported glasses [31, 40, 49, 53, 59, 60] and are indicates in Table. 7
                        . The higher values of quantum efficiency (η%) and stimulated emission cross section (σsec) (5.64×10−21cm2) values of currently prepared glass samples confirm the suitability of OCBTEr1.0 glass as a promising candidate in 1.53μm amplification process.

Evaluation of Physical properties:
The various physical properties accessed for the Er3+ ions doped OCBT glass samples are refractive index (nd), density (n), Average molecular weight(M), Er3+ ion concentration(N), molar volume (Vm), mean atomic volume, molar refraction (Rm), dielectric constant(ε), optical dielectric constant (ε-1), linear dielectric susceptibility(χ), reflection losses(RL), transmission coefficient (T), polaron radius (rp), interatomic distance(ri), molar polarizability (αm), molar electronic polarizability (αme), electronic polarizability (αe), field strength(F), metallization factor (M), oxygen packing density (O.P.D) and average boron-boron separation(d<B-B>). All these physical parameters were determined from the expressions available in literature [16, 17]. From Table. 1
                         it is clearly observed that the values refractive index tends to decline with the raise of Er3+ ion concentration, because the merging of Er3+ ions into host glass leads to reduction of non-bridging oxygen atoms by connecting the bonds between O2− and Er3+ ions. The density tends to increase with Er2O3 concentration because of increasing number of Er3+ ions per unit volume. The variation between refractive index and density with Er3+ ion concentration is depicted in Fig. 1
                        . Mean atomic volume tends to increase with the rise of Er2O3 concentration due to decrease of inter nuclear distance among the atoms and helps in bringing compactness in the glass network [18]. The variation between molar atomic volume and inter ionic distance with increase of Er2O3 is visualized in Fig. 2.
                         The durability, strength of the glass and transformation of BO3 units into BO4 units can be confirmed by the increase of field strength values. The polaron radius and field strength are inversely proportional to each other and their relation is depicted in Fig. 3
                        . The evaluated metallization values are less than one. So, the prepared glass samples possess insulating nature ranging between the values 0.3236-0.3363 and it is evident from the literature that B2O3, alkaline oxides, SiO2 and alkaline earth-oxide based glasses exhibit metallization criterion in the range of 0.50-0.70 [19]

Analysis of Absorption spectra and measurement of JO-Intensity parameters:
Fig. 4
                        . indicates the absorption spectra of Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses. The spectra reveal non-uniform peaks recorded between wavelength region 300 nm and 1700 nm. The ground state of Er2O3 is 4I15/2. The absorption takes from the lower state 4I15/2 to various excited states like 4G9/2, 4G11/2, (2G,4F, 2H)9/2, 4F5/2, 4F7/2, 2H11/2, 4F9/2, 4I9/2, 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 corresponding to 364, 380, 406, 450, 490, 523, 651, 796, 977, 1536 nm respectively due to electrostatic and spin orbit interactions that exists between 4f-4f energy levels of Er3+ ions. The electronic transitions were allotted to the existing absorption peaks as per the procedure given in Carnal et.al [24]. Fig. 4. clearly visualizes that as Er3+ ion concentration increases, the intensity of absorption bands tends to increase and the electronic transitions 4G15/2→4G11/2 and 4G15/2→2H11/2 possess maximum intensity centered at 380, 523 nm. Hence known as hypersensitive transitions and obeys selection rules, ΔJ=2, ΔL=2 and ΔS=0 [25]. These hypersensitive transitions were treated as the characteristics of the host glass network because they are very responsive to their environ [26]. The large matrix values offered by these transitions urge maximum high intensity and this maximum intensity is proportional to

The experimental oscillator strengths (fexp) and calculated oscillator strengths (fcal) along with root mean square deviation (δrms) values are shown in Table. 2
                        . From Table. 2, it is clear that short range magnitude of (δrms) values represents a good quality fit exits between experimental and calculated oscillator strengths of Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses. The covalent or ionic nature of OCBTEr glasses can be known by nephelauxetic ratios (β) and bonding parameters (δ) and were evaluated by using the expression available in the literature [30]. The positive integer represents the covalent nature and negative integers represents the ionic nature of the parent glass. The bonding parameters for the present series prepared glasses are tends to be negative and were -0.00098, -0.00107, -0.00037, -0.00116, -0.00057, -0.00115 for OCBTEr0.1, OCBTEr0.5, OCBTEr1.0, OCBTEr1.5, OCBTEr2.0 and OCBTEr2.5 respectively and represented in Table. 2. Among all the prepared OCBTEr glasses, OCBTEr1.0 glass sample exhibits highest experimental oscillator strength (fexp) and these values are compared with the other reported glasses doped with Er3+ ions [31-35] and are shown in Table. 3
                        .
The local network structure around the rare earth ion can be figure out by the J-O intensity parameter. The parameter Ω2 detects the structural symmetry and nature of metal ligand bond. The other two parameters Ω4 and Ω6 discloses about rigidity and viscosity, basicity, dielectric media, which depicts the bond between ligand atoms and erbium ions [36], vibronic transitions around the host glass matrix [37]. The parameter Ω6 corresponds to the isomer shift (IS), which specifies the 6s electron density of RE3+ion. Ω6 with larger values obtains large emission bandwidth and spontaneous radiative probability of RE3+ions [31]. In the current work, J-O intensity parameters are following the trend as Ω6>Ω2>Ω4. Hence the Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses possess properties like both structural symmetry and rigidity. The measured J-O intensity parameters are reported in Table. 4
                        , along with other reported values [14, 31, 32, 38-44] and graphical relation between three intensity parameter Ω2, Ω4 and Ω6 is depicted in Fig. 5
                        .

Use of J-O parameters in the evaluation of radiative properties analysis:
The radiative properties such as radiative transition probability (Aτ), branching ratio (βR) and radiative lifetime (τrad) of the parent glass have been measured from the J-O intensity parameters (Ωλ=2,4,6) by utilizing the expressions [45]. Moreover, the emission line strengths related to the transitions from the upper multiplet manifolds 2S+1LJ relative to the lower multiplet manifolds of the erbium (Er3+) ions of the host glass matrix can be evaluated by using the JO intensity parameters. The emission transition 4I13/2→4I15/2 of Er3+ion possesses both magnetic and electric dipole moments. The magnetic dipole parameter doesn't depend on the ligand field, but it is responsible to the origin of intensified peak 4I13/2→4I15/2. The magnetic dipole(Smd) line strength is generally considered as the characteristic of transition, which can be evaluated by using quantum numbers and can affect the emission properties of electric dipole transition(Sed). By using J-O parameters, the line strength of electric dipole transition can be measured by the expression (Sed) (4I13/2→4I15/2) = 0.0195Ω2+0.1172Ω4+1.4325Ω6 and is dependent on structure of host glass matrix [46].

                         represents the optical band gap of direct allowed and indirect allowed transitions of Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses. By utilizing absorption spectral data, the optical band gap energy was evaluated by the expression given by Davis and Mott [47].

Here α denotes absorption coefficient, hv represents photon energy, A is the proportionality constant, Eg is the optical bandgap energy and n signifies transition number. As the absorption spectra is processed by direct allowed transition, then n refers to ½ and if it is administered by indirect allowed transitions, then n value is 2. The optical bandgap energy values for allowed direct transitions were obtained by drawing the tangent along the linear slope of curve of (αhν)=0 in the plot of (αhν)2 verses hν. Similarly, the optical bandgap energy values for indirect allowed transitions were measured by extrapolating the tangent on linear part of the curve of (αhν)1/2 =0 in the plot of (αhν)1/2 verses hν. Below the absorption edge, the absorption coefficient varies exponentially with the photon energy which represents the existence of Urbach tail. The Urbach tail appears due to disorderedness in the prepared OCBTEr3+ glasses. The phonon assisted indirect transitions are also responsible for the exponential tail of the absorption edge, which in turn leads to generation of Urbach's energy. The exponential absorption tail and the Urbach's energy are interconnected by using the below expression.

                        . The optical bandgap energies (Eg) of both direct allowed and indirect allowed transitions are tends to increase with increase of Er3+ ion concentration and vary in between 3.45 eV to 3.80 eV for direct allowed and 3.96 eV to 4.17eV for indirect allowed transitions. This increasing nature of bandgap energies indicates the decrease of disorderness in the host glass structure [48] and the Variation of direct and indirect allowed transitions with Er3+ ions concentration is shown in Fig. 9

Excitation and NIR-Emission spectral analysis:
Fig. 10
                         illustrates the excitation spectrum of 1.0 mol% of OCBTEr glass. The excitation spectrum is recorded at an emission wavelength of 1536 nm between wavelength region 300 nm and 1000 nm. Among all excitation bands, the band centered at 522 nm possesses highest intensity. So this excitation transition is used to record the emission spectra in the NIR region. Fig. 11
                         indicates the NIR-emission spectra of Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses. NIR-spectra were recorded between 1400 nm to 1650 nm. All the OCBTEr3+ glasses exhibit only one emission band in NIR-region around 1536 nm (4I13/2→4I15/2) and is inhomogeneity in nature. The transition 4I13/2 →4I15/2 obeys the selection rule ΔS=ΔL=0, ΔJ=+1 because it exhibits both electric and magnetic dipole transitions [49].

To identify any material for active lasing media and broadband amplifiers, the spectroscopic properties of any host matrix like stimulated emission cross-section (σsec), full width at half maxima (FWHM) and effective bandwidth (Δλeff), emission cross-section (σsec) are necessary [32]. The stimulated emission cross-section (σsec) is considered as one of the vital parameters in finding application in optical fibre technology and is evaluated by the expression [50, 51]. Another parameter to have application in the field of optical amplifier is figure of merit (FOM) (FWHMxσsec). The higher values of stimulated emission cross-section indicates the large gain laser operation and low threshold value. In present work OCBTEr1.0 glass shows the higher magnitude of stimulated emission cross-section value.

The vital parameter gain cross-section G(λ) helps in detecting the utility of prepared OCBTEr glasses as EDFA. The transition lies in between two states of ions represents the transition probability and is proportional to absorption cross-section with an incident of photon energy. The absorption cross-section of OCBTEr glasses for the transition 4I13/2→ 4I15/2 can be computed by using the following expression [52].

Fig. 13
                        . illustrates the gain cross section spectrum of OCBTEr1.0 glass which plotted in between wavelength and population inversion coefficients. This Fig. 12, clearly depicts that positive gain for γ > 0.5. This is an indication for population inversion getting its value more than 50% in the OCBTEr1.0 glass which is a notation for having the “flat gain bandwidth in the C band (1530-1564 nm range)” i.e. closely in the optical communication window [55]. Hence OCBTEr1.0 glass is considered as an apt material for 1536 nm laser operation, optical communication window and also for WDM and EDFA applications.

Energy levels scheme:
The partial energy level diagram indicating energy transfer mechanisms, cross relaxation mechanisms of Er3+ ions in OCBT glasses are shown in Fig. 14
                        . The Er3+ ions are excited at an wavelength of 522 nm and monitored emission spectra at an emission wavelength of 1536 nm . The energy transfer among the Er3+ ions takes place in, as one of the important quenching centre caused due to migration of Er3+ ions through the resonant energy transfer between Er3+ ions. The cross-relaxation channels (CN) responsible for the luminescence quenching observed beyond 1 mol% of Er3+ ions concentration are as follows:

Decay lifetime analysis:
In order to analyze the energy transfer characteristics of OCBT glasses activated with Er3+ ions, the average decay lifetime (τexp) of the transition 4I13/2→4I15/2 is calculated for all the prepared OCBTEr glasses by observing the fluorescence decay curve of Er3+ ions at an excitation wavelength of 522nm and an emission wavelength of 1536nm is visualized in Fig. 15
                        . All the measured experimental lifetime of OCBTEr0.1, OCBBTEr0.5, OCBTEr1.0, OCBTEr1.5, OCBTEr2.0 and OCBTEr2.5 glass samples were depicted in Table. 6
                         and well fitted with single exponential function. The average lifetime of Er3+ ions were calculated by making use of the following expression [56].

Here I(t) represents the intensity at any instant time t . From Fig. 11, it is clearly noticed that as Er3+ ions concentration increases, the decay lifetime is prone to decrease. The experimental lifetime (τexp) of Er3+ ions in OCBT glasses were in good agreement with the radiative lifetime (τrad) values measured from the J-O theory. The experimental lifetime (τexp) can be expressed as [57,58].

Where WNR is the non-radiative decay rates that arises due to energy transfer exists between the Er3+ ions and the adjacent pairs of energy levels, WMPR is the also non-radiative decay rate that arise due to multi-phonon relaxation rates exists between Er3+ ions in present glass matrix and WOH is the energy transfer rate which occur between Er3+ ions and OH groups in the host glass matrix [39]. Among all the prepared glass samples, OCBTEr1.0 glass exhibits lowest non-radiative transition rate as 23.32 μs−1, hence it flourishes high quantum efficiency. The rate of energy transfer (ET) depends strongly on rare earth (RE3+) ion concentration and moreover the small variation between experimental (τexp) and radiative (τrad) lifetimes is due to non-radiative relaxation rates exists between Er3+ ions in the higher excited states of the host glass matrix. The ratio of experimental lifetime and calculated radiative lifetime (τexp/τR) gives rise to quantum efficiency (η) of OCBTEr3+ glasses and the efficiency of the OCBTEr1.0 possess highest quantum efficiency and is equal to 90%. Radiative Transition probability (AR)(S−1), branching ratios (βR), effective bandwidth (Δλp)(nm), Stimulated emission cross section (σsecx10−21) (cm2) gain bandwidth (σsecxΔλp10−27cm3), optical gain (σsecxτR)(1018cm2s), radiative lifetime (τR)(ms), experimental lifetimes (τR)(ms), quantum efficiency (η%) and non-radiative transition rates (WNR) for the transition 4I13/2→4I15/2 in Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses are represented in Table. 6.
Comparison of Full width at half maximum (FWHM, nm), stimulated emission cross-section (σsec), lifetime (τexp), optical gain (σsecxτexp) and quantum efficiency (η%) of OCBTEr1.0 glass for the transition 4I13/2→4I15/2 with other reported glasses [31, 40, 49, 53, 59, 60] and are indicates in Table. 7
                        . The higher values of quantum efficiency (η%) and stimulated emission cross section (σsec) (5.64×10−21cm2) values of currently prepared glass samples confirm the suitability of OCBTEr1.0 glass as a promising candidate in 1.53μm amplification process.

Body:
In recent years, researchers are showing great interest towards the optical materials, in order to address the technological challenges in the platform of photoluminescence device utility in solid state lasers, opto electronic devices, optical unit displays, optical amplifiers, up-conversion and down conversion amplifiers and many more [1]. It is well notable that the concentration, dissemination of rare earth ions and local environment of parent glass matrix holds the positive effect in flourishing the luminescence features like emission cross section, intensity, average life span and spectral line width. Hence, these characteristics are considered as the salient features in choice of rare earth ions doped glasses for luminescence device applications [2]. In terms of oxide glasses, borate glasses are considered as noted materials by their stupendous physical and optical properties such as optical transparency, low melting point, good rare earth ion solubility, high chemical and thermal stability and different coordination number [3]. Boron trioxide is a fine glass former that owns the ability to exist in both 3 & 4-coordinated environment with strong covalent B-O bond and is capable to form stable glasses. The only demerit is stretching vibrations produced in oxide glasses results in the exhibition of elevated phonon energies (~1400cm−1) and low refractive index [4], which ultimately leads to non radiative process via multiphonon relaxation mechanisms, which further shows negative impact in rare earth (RE3+) ion photo luminescence and curbs the wide utility of borate glasses in photonic device applications. This demerit can be retrieved by treating the borate glasses with heavy metal oxides with low phonon energies, such as TeO2 (<800cm−1). TeO2 shows transmission region between 0.3-1.6μm and the glass gets stability by the activation of TeO2 into the host glass matrix [5]. The dopant Al2O3 brings high strength, hardness and outstanding thermal resistance to the host matrix [6]. The geometric allocation of RE elements can be accomplished by the addition of Al2O3 in order to prevent the clustering among them, which in turn improves the quality of the optical devices and finds wide practical application like optical lenses and windows, optical waveguides, antireflection coatings and many more [7]. The dopant BaCl2 makes the host glass transparent in IR region [8]. Addition of SrO brings structural stability in the host matrix [9]. The addition of modifiers to the host glass brings structural changes, such as transition of BO3 units into BO4 units and the structure becomes more open due to the non-bridging oxygen atoms enhancement. Due to its good rare earth ion solubility and flexible structure, borate glasses are emerging as potential materials for fabrication of new luminescent device [10] such as lasers, solar up-converters, optical amplifiers, thermo luminescence dosimeters and emission devices [11]. All these applications of borate glasses are possible because of their random structure and excellent optical properties. The radiative quantum efficiency and lifetime are the two vital parameters of the host glass for exhibition of numerous applications. But for attaining good optical properties, the intensity of emission color and proper doping of RE ions in glasses becomes important aspect [12]

Quite recently, up-convert materials are gaining much attention because it owes capability of converting infrared light to visible light and perceives noticeable applications like color displays, optoelectronic devices, fiber amplifiers, optical data storage and under water optical communications [13]

                     Now-a-days wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology is showing tremendous utility in telecommunications because, it transfers large amount of optical data for longer distance. So, broadband fiber amplifiers are the prominent devices in manufacturing the luminescence exhibiting materials between 1200nm to 2600nm. To consummate broad band utility, the host glass should be activated by RE ions. Among various lanthanide ions, Er3+ is one of the significant candidates with metastable energy levels with long lifetime and large absorption cross section at 980 nm. It evinces light in visible and NIR region at 1.5μm by exciting the band at 980nm [14]. The most important characteristic feature of Er3+ ions in infrared (NIR) emission at 1.5 μm through the 4I13/2→4I15/2 transition and finds numerous applications in telecommunication such as frequency up-conversion lasers, waveguide lasers, waveguide amplifiers, eye safe laser systems, full color solid state displays, wave length division multiplexing (WDM), network system, erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) and lidar transmitters [15]. The current work is mainly focused on the physical and spectroscopic properties of erbium ion doped oxy chloro boro tellurite glasses, which unquestionably exist their application in the platform of technologies like solid state lasers and erbium doped fiber amplifiers etc.

In the current work, different concentrations of Er3+doped oxy chloro boro tellurite glasses were prepared using chemicals such as strontium carbonate (SrCO3), aluminum trioxide (Al2O3), boron trioxide (B2O3), barium choride (BaCl2), tellurium dioxide (TeO2) and erbium trioxide (Er2O3). All these chemicals are 99.9% analar grade chemicals. The host glass composition is 10 SrO + (10-x) Al2O3 + 60 B2O3 + 10 BaCl2 + 10 TeO2 + x Er2O3 (where x=0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mol % of Er3+ ions) and the prepared glass samples are labeled as follows:

The raw chemicals are weighed according to the base composition and were grinded well in a agate mortar to get fine and homogeneous powder. The fine mixture is taken in to the silica crucibles and kept in an electrical furnace for 1 hour in order to get molten melt. Subsequently the molten mixture was quenched by pouring in on a preheated brass plate and pressed against them by another brass plate. The formed transparent glass samples were annealed for 2 hours to wipe the bubbles formed in it. The obtained glass samples were cut and polished for optical characterization.

The various physical properties accessed for the Er3+ ions doped OCBT glass samples are refractive index (nd), density (n), Average molecular weight(M), Er3+ ion concentration(N), molar volume (Vm), mean atomic volume, molar refraction (Rm), dielectric constant(ε), optical dielectric constant (ε-1), linear dielectric susceptibility(χ), reflection losses(RL), transmission coefficient (T), polaron radius (rp), interatomic distance(ri), molar polarizability (αm), molar electronic polarizability (αme), electronic polarizability (αe), field strength(F), metallization factor (M), oxygen packing density (O.P.D) and average boron-boron separation(d<B-B>). All these physical parameters were determined from the expressions available in literature [16, 17]. From Table. 1
                         it is clearly observed that the values refractive index tends to decline with the raise of Er3+ ion concentration, because the merging of Er3+ ions into host glass leads to reduction of non-bridging oxygen atoms by connecting the bonds between O2− and Er3+ ions. The density tends to increase with Er2O3 concentration because of increasing number of Er3+ ions per unit volume. The variation between refractive index and density with Er3+ ion concentration is depicted in Fig. 1
                        . Mean atomic volume tends to increase with the rise of Er2O3 concentration due to decrease of inter nuclear distance among the atoms and helps in bringing compactness in the glass network [18]. The variation between molar atomic volume and inter ionic distance with increase of Er2O3 is visualized in Fig. 2.
                         The durability, strength of the glass and transformation of BO3 units into BO4 units can be confirmed by the increase of field strength values. The polaron radius and field strength are inversely proportional to each other and their relation is depicted in Fig. 3
                        . The evaluated metallization values are less than one. So, the prepared glass samples possess insulating nature ranging between the values 0.3236-0.3363 and it is evident from the literature that B2O3, alkaline oxides, SiO2 and alkaline earth-oxide based glasses exhibit metallization criterion in the range of 0.50-0.70 [19]

The term polarizability describes the response of electrons to an electromagnetic field in a material. The molar polarizability can be measured by using the molar refractive index (Rm) and Avogadro's number (NA) [20] and is expressed as

Fig. 4
                        . indicates the absorption spectra of Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses. The spectra reveal non-uniform peaks recorded between wavelength region 300 nm and 1700 nm. The ground state of Er2O3 is 4I15/2. The absorption takes from the lower state 4I15/2 to various excited states like 4G9/2, 4G11/2, (2G,4F, 2H)9/2, 4F5/2, 4F7/2, 2H11/2, 4F9/2, 4I9/2, 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 corresponding to 364, 380, 406, 450, 490, 523, 651, 796, 977, 1536 nm respectively due to electrostatic and spin orbit interactions that exists between 4f-4f energy levels of Er3+ ions. The electronic transitions were allotted to the existing absorption peaks as per the procedure given in Carnal et.al [24]. Fig. 4. clearly visualizes that as Er3+ ion concentration increases, the intensity of absorption bands tends to increase and the electronic transitions 4G15/2→4G11/2 and 4G15/2→2H11/2 possess maximum intensity centered at 380, 523 nm. Hence known as hypersensitive transitions and obeys selection rules, ΔJ=2, ΔL=2 and ΔS=0 [25]. These hypersensitive transitions were treated as the characteristics of the host glass network because they are very responsive to their environ [26]. The large matrix values offered by these transitions urge maximum high intensity and this maximum intensity is proportional to

The experimental oscillator strengths (fexp) and calculated oscillator strengths (fcal) along with root mean square deviation (δrms) values are shown in Table. 2
                        . From Table. 2, it is clear that short range magnitude of (δrms) values represents a good quality fit exits between experimental and calculated oscillator strengths of Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses. The covalent or ionic nature of OCBTEr glasses can be known by nephelauxetic ratios (β) and bonding parameters (δ) and were evaluated by using the expression available in the literature [30]. The positive integer represents the covalent nature and negative integers represents the ionic nature of the parent glass. The bonding parameters for the present series prepared glasses are tends to be negative and were -0.00098, -0.00107, -0.00037, -0.00116, -0.00057, -0.00115 for OCBTEr0.1, OCBTEr0.5, OCBTEr1.0, OCBTEr1.5, OCBTEr2.0 and OCBTEr2.5 respectively and represented in Table. 2. Among all the prepared OCBTEr glasses, OCBTEr1.0 glass sample exhibits highest experimental oscillator strength (fexp) and these values are compared with the other reported glasses doped with Er3+ ions [31-35] and are shown in Table. 3

The local network structure around the rare earth ion can be figure out by the J-O intensity parameter. The parameter Ω2 detects the structural symmetry and nature of metal ligand bond. The other two parameters Ω4 and Ω6 discloses about rigidity and viscosity, basicity, dielectric media, which depicts the bond between ligand atoms and erbium ions [36], vibronic transitions around the host glass matrix [37]. The parameter Ω6 corresponds to the isomer shift (IS), which specifies the 6s electron density of RE3+ion. Ω6 with larger values obtains large emission bandwidth and spontaneous radiative probability of RE3+ions [31]. In the current work, J-O intensity parameters are following the trend as Ω6>Ω2>Ω4. Hence the Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses possess properties like both structural symmetry and rigidity. The measured J-O intensity parameters are reported in Table. 4
                        , along with other reported values [14, 31, 32, 38-44] and graphical relation between three intensity parameter Ω2, Ω4 and Ω6 is depicted in Fig. 5
                        .

The radiative properties such as radiative transition probability (Aτ), branching ratio (βR) and radiative lifetime (τrad) of the parent glass have been measured from the J-O intensity parameters (Ωλ=2,4,6) by utilizing the expressions [45]. Moreover, the emission line strengths related to the transitions from the upper multiplet manifolds 2S+1LJ relative to the lower multiplet manifolds of the erbium (Er3+) ions of the host glass matrix can be evaluated by using the JO intensity parameters. The emission transition 4I13/2→4I15/2 of Er3+ion possesses both magnetic and electric dipole moments. The magnetic dipole parameter doesn't depend on the ligand field, but it is responsible to the origin of intensified peak 4I13/2→4I15/2. The magnetic dipole(Smd) line strength is generally considered as the characteristic of transition, which can be evaluated by using quantum numbers and can affect the emission properties of electric dipole transition(Sed). By using J-O parameters, the line strength of electric dipole transition can be measured by the expression (Sed) (4I13/2→4I15/2) = 0.0195Ω2+0.1172Ω4+1.4325Ω6 and is dependent on structure of host glass matrix [46].

                         represents the optical band gap of direct allowed and indirect allowed transitions of Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses. By utilizing absorption spectral data, the optical band gap energy was evaluated by the expression given by Davis and Mott [47].

Here α denotes absorption coefficient, hv represents photon energy, A is the proportionality constant, Eg is the optical bandgap energy and n signifies transition number. As the absorption spectra is processed by direct allowed transition, then n refers to ½ and if it is administered by indirect allowed transitions, then n value is 2. The optical bandgap energy values for allowed direct transitions were obtained by drawing the tangent along the linear slope of curve of (αhν)=0 in the plot of (αhν)2 verses hν. Similarly, the optical bandgap energy values for indirect allowed transitions were measured by extrapolating the tangent on linear part of the curve of (αhν)1/2 =0 in the plot of (αhν)1/2 verses hν. Below the absorption edge, the absorption coefficient varies exponentially with the photon energy which represents the existence of Urbach tail. The Urbach tail appears due to disorderedness in the prepared OCBTEr3+ glasses. The phonon assisted indirect transitions are also responsible for the exponential tail of the absorption edge, which in turn leads to generation of Urbach's energy. The exponential absorption tail and the Urbach's energy are interconnected by using the below expression.

                        . The optical bandgap energies (Eg) of both direct allowed and indirect allowed transitions are tends to increase with increase of Er3+ ion concentration and vary in between 3.45 eV to 3.80 eV for direct allowed and 3.96 eV to 4.17eV for indirect allowed transitions. This increasing nature of bandgap energies indicates the decrease of disorderness in the host glass structure [48] and the Variation of direct and indirect allowed transitions with Er3+ ions concentration is shown in Fig. 9
                        .

                         illustrates the excitation spectrum of 1.0 mol% of OCBTEr glass. The excitation spectrum is recorded at an emission wavelength of 1536 nm between wavelength region 300 nm and 1000 nm. Among all excitation bands, the band centered at 522 nm possesses highest intensity. So this excitation transition is used to record the emission spectra in the NIR region. Fig. 11
                         indicates the NIR-emission spectra of Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses. NIR-spectra were recorded between 1400 nm to 1650 nm. All the OCBTEr3+ glasses exhibit only one emission band in NIR-region around 1536 nm (4I13/2→4I15/2) and is inhomogeneity in nature. The transition 4I13/2 →4I15/2 obeys the selection rule ΔS=ΔL=0, ΔJ=+1 because it exhibits both electric and magnetic dipole transitions [49].

To identify any material for active lasing media and broadband amplifiers, the spectroscopic properties of any host matrix like stimulated emission cross-section (σsec), full width at half maxima (FWHM) and effective bandwidth (Δλeff), emission cross-section (σsec) are necessary [32]. The stimulated emission cross-section (σsec) is considered as one of the vital parameters in finding application in optical fibre technology and is evaluated by the expression [50, 51]. Another parameter to have application in the field of optical amplifier is figure of merit (FOM) (FWHMxσsec). The higher values of stimulated emission cross-section indicates the large gain laser operation and low threshold value. In present work OCBTEr1.0 glass shows the higher magnitude of stimulated emission cross-section value.

The vital parameter gain cross-section G(λ) helps in detecting the utility of prepared OCBTEr glasses as EDFA. The transition lies in between two states of ions represents the transition probability and is proportional to absorption cross-section with an incident of photon energy. The absorption cross-section of OCBTEr glasses for the transition 4I13/2→ 4I15/2 can be computed by using the following expression [52].

Fig. 13
                        . illustrates the gain cross section spectrum of OCBTEr1.0 glass which plotted in between wavelength and population inversion coefficients. This Fig. 12, clearly depicts that positive gain for γ > 0.5. This is an indication for population inversion getting its value more than 50% in the OCBTEr1.0 glass which is a notation for having the “flat gain bandwidth in the C band (1530-1564 nm range)” i.e. closely in the optical communication window [55]. Hence OCBTEr1.0 glass is considered as an apt material for 1536 nm laser operation, optical communication window and also for WDM and EDFA applications.

Here I(t) represents the intensity at any instant time t . From Fig. 11, it is clearly noticed that as Er3+ ions concentration increases, the decay lifetime is prone to decrease. The experimental lifetime (τexp) of Er3+ ions in OCBT glasses were in good agreement with the radiative lifetime (τrad) values measured from the J-O theory. The experimental lifetime (τexp) can be expressed as [57,58].

Where WNR is the non-radiative decay rates that arises due to energy transfer exists between the Er3+ ions and the adjacent pairs of energy levels, WMPR is the also non-radiative decay rate that arise due to multi-phonon relaxation rates exists between Er3+ ions in present glass matrix and WOH is the energy transfer rate which occur between Er3+ ions and OH groups in the host glass matrix [39]. Among all the prepared glass samples, OCBTEr1.0 glass exhibits lowest non-radiative transition rate as 23.32 μs−1, hence it flourishes high quantum efficiency. The rate of energy transfer (ET) depends strongly on rare earth (RE3+) ion concentration and moreover the small variation between experimental (τexp) and radiative (τrad) lifetimes is due to non-radiative relaxation rates exists between Er3+ ions in the higher excited states of the host glass matrix. The ratio of experimental lifetime and calculated radiative lifetime (τexp/τR) gives rise to quantum efficiency (η) of OCBTEr3+ glasses and the efficiency of the OCBTEr1.0 possess highest quantum efficiency and is equal to 90%. Radiative Transition probability (AR)(S−1), branching ratios (βR), effective bandwidth (Δλp)(nm), Stimulated emission cross section (σsecx10−21) (cm2) gain bandwidth (σsecxΔλp10−27cm3), optical gain (σsecxτR)(1018cm2s), radiative lifetime (τR)(ms), experimental lifetimes (τR)(ms), quantum efficiency (η%) and non-radiative transition rates (WNR) for the transition 4I13/2→4I15/2 in Er3+ ions doped OCBT glasses are represented in Table. 6.

Comparison of Full width at half maximum (FWHM, nm), stimulated emission cross-section (σsec), lifetime (τexp), optical gain (σsecxτexp) and quantum efficiency (η%) of OCBTEr1.0 glass for the transition 4I13/2→4I15/2 with other reported glasses [31, 40, 49, 53, 59, 60] and are indicates in Table. 7
                        . The higher values of quantum efficiency (η%) and stimulated emission cross section (σsec) (5.64×10−21cm2) values of currently prepared glass samples confirm the suitability of OCBTEr1.0 glass as a promising candidate in 1.53μm amplification process.

Title:
Optical and devitrification kinetic studies of chloro-antimonate glasses

Abstract:
In this present work optical and devitrification studies of the synthesized 80 Sb2O3 –10 SrCl2 – 10 CdCl2 glasses were explored. The samples were annealed at temperature 455 °C by the different time range from 10 to 25 min with an interval of 5 min. All the synthesized samples have been characterized by spectroscopic techniques viz., UV–visible transmission, Fourier Transform Infrared transmission and Urbach plot was the complementary for the optical band gap calculation, finally the refractive index of the glass sample has been determined. The synthesized glass sample has a large optical window operating between 361 nm and 7.51 μm and has a high refractive index close to 1.7. The Urbach's plot shows that the optical band gap of the glass sample reaches a higher order value 3.25 eV. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination confirms that devitrification obeyed superficial mechanism, when controlled by the specific pre-nucleation process, which is based on self-creation of rough areas and the crystallization diffusion depth. On surface crystals formed in different morphologies like polyhedron; hemispherical (rarely); lath and needle. The progression of crystallization towards the interior is done layer by layer mode (nested lamellae) whereas the contour of the assembly is in a root mode. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shows that the crystalline structure is composed of Valentenite. The kinetic parameters such as crystallization energy (150 kJ/mol) and the Avrami's (n = 3.405) index were calculated according to Chen's and Ozawa's methods. The attractive optical qualities and kinetic parameters indicate that the synthesized glass sample is a good stability against devitrification.

Introduction:
The crystallization of a glass is an exothermic phenomenon leading to the thermodynamic equilibrium of the material and is carried out by nucleation, growth, and managed by several different mechanisms [1–3]. The earliest proof of Winberg, Zanatto and Fokin [4–6] studies, addressing the fundamental aspect of nucleation whereas the Johnson - Mehl - Avrami - Kolmogorov [7] model describes the kinetics of phase transition accounting for the nucleation and growth. The crystallization of glass is a crucial importance for optimizing nano and microstructured glass-ceramics [6–17] and also making an optical fiber drawing is a technologically challenging matter [18,19]. However, Sb2O3 antimonate glasses have potential optronic applications, due to their nonlinear third order (χ3) susceptibility, low phonon energy and broad optical window i.e. from visible to mid-infrared wavelength range [20–24].
Over the past two decades the research dealing with the crystallization of antimonate based glasses; represent a limited number of articles [18,25–29]. Therefore, we gave the emphasis to the crystallization and the present article is devoted to the crystallization study of 80 Sb2O3 – 10 CdCl2 – 10 SrCl2 glasses. Before approaching the crystallization study, we proceeded to an optical characterization for the calculation of the refractive index, the limits of the optical window and the optical band gap, whereas amorphous nature and glass transition temperature details were reported in our previous article [20].
In the present studies a crystallization annealing temperature 455 °C has been applied to the four vitreous samples to the treatment time varies from 10 min to 25 min by an interval of 5 min. The mechanisms of crystal growth and morphologies have been explored by using SEM studies and also crystallization of the glasses was discussed. X-ray diffraction pattern has shown that glass crystallizes in Valentinite the one of the allotropic forms of antimonate.
The final part of the present work is emphases to the determination of the kinetic parameters of crystallization, namely the crystallization activation energy and the Avrami's index by using the Chen's [30], Ozawa's [31] methods for different heating rates via Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements.

Experimental:
Glass sample synthesis is carried out with reagent grade chemicals, following melt-quenching method and the details are mentioned in our previous work [20]. The refractive index of the prepared sample was determined by measuring the critical angle Θc for the sample/prism interface using different laser beam wavelengths, especially 633 nm; 1311 nm and 1551 nm by using the instrument Metricon-2010 model. This apparatus operates as a refractometer, providing accurate measurement of refractive index (±0.001). The prism index must be higher than the expected glass index, for total internal reflection of the input beam will occur, and the detector will receive a large intensity. It is important to note that adequate pressure must be applied between the prism and glass for coupling to occur. This pressure serves to minimize the air gap between the two materials, resulting a maximum coupling between the prism and sample. Optical transmission in the UV–visible range was recorded between 350 nm and 800 nm by a PerkinElmer spectrophotometer. Infrared absorption spectrum was measured between 400 cm−1 and 4000 cm−1 using a TENSOR 37 FTIR Infrared spectrophotometer.
We have given to four bulk samples of glass composition 80 Sb2O3 – 10 CdCl2 – 10 SrCl2 an isothermal annealing for devitrification at temperature 455 °C and it corresponds to TX + 5 °C (TX = onset point of crystallization) with respect to the crystallization peak at heating rate 2 °C/min. The annealing is done in chamber furnace with Nabertherm model. After heating, each sample was quenched in fresh air for conserving the structure at fixed times.
The only variable in this process is the treatment time and is taken as 10 min; 15 min; 20 min and 25 min. Before treatment the four samples have the same temperature and the samples have a disk shape with the diameter 10 mm and the thickness 5 mm. Each sample must be broken in two pieces by bending and then conferred a gold sputter deposit to facilitate the SEM examination. The micrographs were made both for the surface and the transverse side. JEOL JSM 840 model with a voltage of 7 kV is used for the SEM measurements. In other side DSC measurements were made for four different heating rates 2; 4; 6; and 8 K/min for the kinetic study. A DSC apparatus of Q2O model with sensitivity 0.1 °C with the argon atmosphere installation has been employed in the thermal studies. In these measurements we have encapsulated the coarse particles of glass within the well-sealed aluminum crucibles. XRD pattern is taken from a crystallized sample at room temperature by a Bruker D8 type diffractometer and the measuring is carried out by copper Kα radiation at the 1.54 A° wavelength. The generator settings are under 40 kV, and 40 mA voltage and current respectively. The standard scanning angle (2θ) is done from 8° to 90°; with step size of 0.02°.

                     Optical properties
                     The preliminary results (reported in Table 1
                        ) of this study related to the fundamental optical properties of the prepared glass sample. The energy band gap between the valence and conduction electronic layers of a material affects the UV–visible and can be determined by the Urbach method. From the UV–visible transmission curve (Fig. 1
                        ) the cut-off wavelength361 nm is determined by extrapolation the tangent for intercepting the x-axis. Similarly, the optical gap energy 3.25 eV is determined by the Tauc plot (Fig. 2
                        ) [32]. The multiphonon relaxation wavelength 7.61 μm corresponds to the zero value of infrared transmission is as shown in Fig. 3
                        .
                     The infrared transmission curve has absorption bands consecutive to OH contamination between 3500 and 3200 cm−1 and SiO at the limit of 1800 cm−1. The presence of OH alters the optical window of the glass, and infrared transmission begins practically after this absorption band, starting at 3200 cm−1. These effects can be reduced with the use of a gold crucible and the addition of fluorinated agent during the synthesis of the glass in order to release hydrogen as shown by the following chemical reaction:

                     Refractive index measurements of a prepared sample show a little bit high value around 1.7 this value exceed those of conventional glasses.
                     
                        3.1.1
                        Sample 1- Review at 10 min
                        After 10 min in annealing; we found that the crystallization occurs only on the surface, in prime areas. Fig. 4
                           .a shows the appearance of roughness of the glass surface and also observed their multiplication in other superficial area and a crystal growth takes place in this rough zone. It has formed a polyhedron and hemispherical shapes (Fig. 4.b). Another type of lath-shaped crystals is formed in the surface cavities (Fig. 4.c). In this process, the crystallization phenomenon remains confined in favors sites in surface and do not diffuse in the depth of the sample.
                     
                     
                        3.1.2
                        Sample 2- Review at 15 min
                        15 min afterwards the crystallization starts from the surface and diffuse in the depth of the sample, as shown in Fig. 5
                           .a. It is noted that the crystal growth is done by nested lamella. Whole crystalline region is taking the root form, since the length of the lamella decreases from the surface to the depth. The micrograph of Fig. 5.b shows an intense surface crystalline development, as needles and laths-like randomly oriented and interfere with each other. Fig. 5.c micrograph further clarifies this situation under high magnification.
                     
                     
                        3.1.3
                        Sample 3- Review at 20 min
                        Later 20 min, polyhedral crystals are formed in rough and smooth surface areas (Fig. 6
                           .a, b). Therefore crystallization on a smooth area appears late compared to that in a rough area. In Fig. 6.c, we found that the crystallization propagates in different directions towards the sample's core. This crystalline development starts from the same zone of germination of the superficial crystals. In this case the crystalline growth towards the depth is most intense with respect to the sample (2), whereas crystallization has been developed in isolated root.
                     
                     
                        3.1.4
                        Sample 4- Review at 25 min
                        In the next 25 min, the glass surface is completely covered by a crystalline film of thickness 70 μm (Fig. 7
                           .a). Fig. 7.b represents a magnification of the previous one; where lamellar crystals formant roots and this process leads the meeting of lamella of two adjacent roots. At this stage crystal/glass interfaces disappear, however the volume fraction of amorphous phase decreases. This process decreases the free energy of the system and makes it more stable. Fig. 7.c presents the opportunity for a more detail on the surface where the coalescence of different crystals is covered on the surface.

                        b show the XRD patterns and the peaks are listed with the associate phase. However the identified structure is Valentinite, it is orthorhombic variety of antimonate Sb2O3. We used software installed in the machine for phase determination. Peaks research met the following criteria:
                     Minimum significance = 2, Minimum tip width = 0.01, Maximum tip width = 1, Peak base width = 2 and the method is second derivative minimum.

                     Crystallization kinetic study
                     We emphasis a non-isothermal study for the determination of the kinetic parameters of glass's crystallization. DSC measurements were made for four heating rates, as shown in Fig. 9
                        .a. Table 2
                         reports the data extracted from the DSC curves, which are needed to calculate the crystallization energy and the Avrami's index. The peak area of crystallization is limited between the baseline of DSC and the heat flux curve.
                     The crystallization energy was calculated by linear regression at TP (temperature at a maximum flux of crystallization's peak); using Chen's [30] and Ozawa's [31] formulas (equations (1) and (2) respectively):

                        Fig. 9.c represents a plot of experimental data and their associate linear fittings used to determine the Avrami's indexes. These values are listed in Table 3
                         and the average of these values is 3.405. Usually this value indicates that the crystallization is made by interface-controlled and rate-increasing two dimensional nucleation mode.
                     The chloro-antimonate 80 Sb2O3 -10 CdCl2 -10 SrCl2 glass has interesting optical qualities. In particular its large optical window, which covers the visible range to mid-infrared. This property is a consequence of low phonon energy 600 cm−1 of the Sb–O bond [22]. The high value of the refractive index depends on the polarizability of the glassy former [20]. A high refractive index increases the probability of radiative transitions in glass matrices doped with lanthanides. These aspects make the study of mechanism and kinetics of crystallization of paramount importance.
                     The SEM examination confirms that the devitrification of the 80 Sb2O3 –10 SrCl2 – 10 CdCl2 glasses obeys the surface mechanism. Devitrification begins at specific sites on the surface and the main process consists of the formation of roughness and also which constitute favorable sites for the germination and growth of polyhedral crystals. The roughness appear in a limited area and then widens, following the thermal agitation of the super cooled liquid. From our point of view, the three concepts, namely, the kinetic theory of liquids, model describing surface and the theory explaining the creation of surface roughness following the matter exchange are necessary to explain this phenomenon. In the kinetic theory of liquids, atoms on the surface have low bond energy. They migrate under thermal agitation, which creates vacancies allowing the atoms of sub-adjacent layers to fill them [33]. At the atomic scale the surface of a material can be described by the TLK model (terrace - ledge - kink) and TSK model (terrace - step - kink) [34,35].
                     According to Elwell and Scheel [36] the arrival of material flow at the surface leads to the formation of clusters or bunches of steps (step is an element of TSK model) which will form a rough surface on a microscopic scale. The latter offers the diffusing entity several possibilities of chemical bonds, which initiate nucleation and growth. Therefore the crystallization process on rough surfaces is faster compared to smooth surfaces. The crystallization catalyst roughness appear spontaneously by thermal effect and constitutes a pre-nucleation process distinguishing chloro-antimonate glass. But amorphous phase separation (APS) and spinodal decomposition constitute the pre-nucleation processes for certain classic and special glasses. APS and spinodal decomposition appear throughout the volume [1,11]. On the other hand the mechanism of pre-nucleation of chloro-antimonate glass is of a superficial nature. Surface defects (at the micron scale) such as cavities and porosities are precursors to the germination and growth of crystals in the form of laths-like and needles. We believe that it is the confinement of roughness at the tips of these defects which promotes one-dimensional or pseudo one-dimensional (lath-like) crystal growth.
                     Generally the value of the Avrami's index n = 3.405 indicates that the growth is done by the exchange at the interface with a decreasing nucleation rate [37]. Depending on the specificity of the case physically there are other alternatives associated with this value. Indeed, high values of Avrami's index 3 ≤ n ≤ 4 can represent a specific mode of rapid crystallization. We cite the formation of precipitates in grain boundaries, and crystal growth on impurities [38]. In our case the rough zones accelerate and dominate the crystallization on the surface and also the calculated value of the Avrami's index n = 3.405.
                     The calculated values of the crystallization energy have a high energy barrier to crystallization; promoting good stability of the studied glass. However the lamellar growth mechanism inside the glass requires a large number of interfaces in molar volume; and increases the energy barrier. Each time additional energy require to form a new interface between lamellae. The DSC analysis presents a single crystallization peak for the different heating rates and X-ray diffraction patterns shows that the glass crystallizes into valentinite. The single-phase nature of the crystallization is returned to the quantitative dominance of antimonate (80% Sb2O3) and good solubility of the cadmium and strontium chlorides in this matrix. Indeed valentinite plays the role of solvent and the chlorides are the solutes.

Optical properties:
The preliminary results (reported in Table 1
                        ) of this study related to the fundamental optical properties of the prepared glass sample. The energy band gap between the valence and conduction electronic layers of a material affects the UV–visible and can be determined by the Urbach method. From the UV–visible transmission curve (Fig. 1
                        ) the cut-off wavelength361 nm is determined by extrapolation the tangent for intercepting the x-axis. Similarly, the optical gap energy 3.25 eV is determined by the Tauc plot (Fig. 2
                        ) [32]. The multiphonon relaxation wavelength 7.61 μm corresponds to the zero value of infrared transmission is as shown in Fig. 3
                        .
The infrared transmission curve has absorption bands consecutive to OH contamination between 3500 and 3200 cm−1 and SiO at the limit of 1800 cm−1. The presence of OH alters the optical window of the glass, and infrared transmission begins practically after this absorption band, starting at 3200 cm−1. These effects can be reduced with the use of a gold crucible and the addition of fluorinated agent during the synthesis of the glass in order to release hydrogen as shown by the following chemical reaction:

                        Sample 1- Review at 10 min
                        After 10 min in annealing; we found that the crystallization occurs only on the surface, in prime areas. Fig. 4
                           .a shows the appearance of roughness of the glass surface and also observed their multiplication in other superficial area and a crystal growth takes place in this rough zone. It has formed a polyhedron and hemispherical shapes (Fig. 4.b). Another type of lath-shaped crystals is formed in the surface cavities (Fig. 4.c). In this process, the crystallization phenomenon remains confined in favors sites in surface and do not diffuse in the depth of the sample.

                        Sample 2- Review at 15 min
                        15 min afterwards the crystallization starts from the surface and diffuse in the depth of the sample, as shown in Fig. 5
                           .a. It is noted that the crystal growth is done by nested lamella. Whole crystalline region is taking the root form, since the length of the lamella decreases from the surface to the depth. The micrograph of Fig. 5.b shows an intense surface crystalline development, as needles and laths-like randomly oriented and interfere with each other. Fig. 5.c micrograph further clarifies this situation under high magnification.

                        Sample 3- Review at 20 min
                        Later 20 min, polyhedral crystals are formed in rough and smooth surface areas (Fig. 6
                           .a, b). Therefore crystallization on a smooth area appears late compared to that in a rough area. In Fig. 6.c, we found that the crystallization propagates in different directions towards the sample's core. This crystalline development starts from the same zone of germination of the superficial crystals. In this case the crystalline growth towards the depth is most intense with respect to the sample (2), whereas crystallization has been developed in isolated root.

                        Sample 4- Review at 25 min
                        In the next 25 min, the glass surface is completely covered by a crystalline film of thickness 70 μm (Fig. 7
                           .a). Fig. 7.b represents a magnification of the previous one; where lamellar crystals formant roots and this process leads the meeting of lamella of two adjacent roots. At this stage crystal/glass interfaces disappear, however the volume fraction of amorphous phase decreases. This process decreases the free energy of the system and makes it more stable. Fig. 7.c presents the opportunity for a more detail on the surface where the coalescence of different crystals is covered on the surface.

Sample 1- Review at 10 min:

Sample 2- Review at 15 min:
15 min afterwards the crystallization starts from the surface and diffuse in the depth of the sample, as shown in Fig. 5
                           .a. It is noted that the crystal growth is done by nested lamella. Whole crystalline region is taking the root form, since the length of the lamella decreases from the surface to the depth.

Sample 3- Review at 20 min:
Later 20 min, polyhedral crystals are formed in rough and smooth surface areas (Fig. 6
                           .a, b). Therefore crystallization on a smooth area appears late compared to that in a rough area. In Fig. 6.c, we found that the crystallization propagates in different directions towards the sample's core. This crystalline development starts from the same zone of germination of the superficial crystals. In this case the crystalline growth towards the depth is most intense with respect to the sample (2), whereas crystallization has been developed in isolated root.

In the next 25 min, the glass surface is completely covered by a crystalline film of thickness 70 μm (Fig. 7
                           .a). Fig. 7.b represents a magnification of the previous one; where lamellar crystals formant roots and this process leads the meeting of lamella of two adjacent roots. At this stage crystal/glass interfaces disappear, however the volume fraction of amorphous phase decreases. This process decreases the free energy of the system and makes it more stable. Fig. 7.c presents the opportunity for a more detail on the surface where the coalescence of different crystals is covered on the surface.

X ray diffraction [sample (5); treated at 455 °C]:
Fig. 8.a & 8.
                        b show the XRD patterns and the peaks are listed with the associate phase. However the identified structure is Valentinite, it is orthorhombic variety of antimonate Sb2O3. We used software installed in the machine for phase determination. Peaks research met the following criteria:
Minimum significance = 2, Minimum tip width = 0.01, Maximum tip width = 1, Peak base width = 2 and the method is second derivative minimum.

Crystallization kinetic study:
We emphasis a non-isothermal study for the determination of the kinetic parameters of glass's crystallization. DSC measurements were made for four heating rates, as shown in Fig. 9
                        .a. Table 2
                         reports the data extracted from the DSC curves, which are needed to calculate the crystallization energy and the Avrami's index. The peak area of crystallization is limited between the baseline of DSC and the heat flux curve.
The crystallization energy was calculated by linear regression at TP (temperature at a maximum flux of crystallization's peak); using Chen's [30] and Ozawa's [31] formulas (equations (1) and (2) respectively):

                         and the average of these values is 3.405. Usually this value indicates that the crystallization is made by interface-controlled and rate-increasing two dimensional nucleation mode.
The chloro-antimonate 80 Sb2O3 -10 CdCl2 -10 SrCl2 glass has interesting optical qualities. In particular its large optical window, which covers the visible range to mid-infrared. This property is a consequence of low phonon energy 600 cm−1 of the Sb–O bond [22]. The high value of the refractive index depends on the polarizability of the glassy former [20]. A high refractive index increases the probability of radiative transitions in glass matrices doped with lanthanides. These aspects make the study of mechanism and kinetics of crystallization of paramount importance.
The SEM examination confirms that the devitrification of the 80 Sb2O3 –10 SrCl2 – 10 CdCl2 glasses obeys the surface mechanism. Devitrification begins at specific sites on the surface and the main process consists of the formation of roughness and also which constitute favorable sites for the germination and growth of polyhedral crystals. The roughness appear in a limited area and then widens, following the thermal agitation of the super cooled liquid. From our point of view, the three concepts, namely, the kinetic theory of liquids, model describing surface and the theory explaining the creation of surface roughness following the matter exchange are necessary to explain this phenomenon. In the kinetic theory of liquids, atoms on the surface have low bond energy. They migrate under thermal agitation, which creates vacancies allowing the atoms of sub-adjacent layers to fill them [33]. At the atomic scale the surface of a material can be described by the TLK model (terrace - ledge - kink) and TSK model (terrace - step - kink) [34,35].
According to Elwell and Scheel [36] the arrival of material flow at the surface leads to the formation of clusters or bunches of steps (step is an element of TSK model) which will form a rough surface on a microscopic scale. The latter offers the diffusing entity several possibilities of chemical bonds, which initiate nucleation and growth. Therefore the crystallization process on rough surfaces is faster compared to smooth surfaces. The crystallization catalyst roughness appear spontaneously by thermal effect and constitutes a pre-nucleation process distinguishing chloro-antimonate glass. But amorphous phase separation (APS) and spinodal decomposition constitute the pre-nucleation processes for certain classic and special glasses. APS and spinodal decomposition appear throughout the volume [1,11]. On the other hand the mechanism of pre-nucleation of chloro-antimonate glass is of a superficial nature. Surface defects (at the micron scale) such as cavities and porosities are precursors to the germination and growth of crystals in the form of laths-like and needles. We believe that it is the confinement of roughness at the tips of these defects which promotes one-dimensional or pseudo one-dimensional (lath-like) crystal growth.
Generally the value of the Avrami's index n = 3.405 indicates that the growth is done by the exchange at the interface with a decreasing nucleation rate [37]. Depending on the specificity of the case physically there are other alternatives associated with this value. Indeed, high values of Avrami's index 3 ≤ n ≤ 4 can represent a specific mode of rapid crystallization. We cite the formation of precipitates in grain boundaries, and crystal growth on impurities [38]. In our case the rough zones accelerate and dominate the crystallization on the surface and also the calculated value of the Avrami's index n = 3.405.
The calculated values of the crystallization energy have a high energy barrier to crystallization; promoting good stability of the studied glass. However the lamellar growth mechanism inside the glass requires a large number of interfaces in molar volume; and increases the energy barrier. Each time additional energy require to form a new interface between lamellae. The DSC analysis presents a single crystallization peak for the different heating rates and X-ray diffraction patterns shows that the glass crystallizes into valentinite. The single-phase nature of the crystallization is returned to the quantitative dominance of antimonate (80% Sb2O3) and good solubility of the cadmium and strontium chlorides in this matrix. Indeed valentinite plays the role of solvent and the chlorides are the solutes.

Conclusion:
80 Sb2O3 –10 SrCl2 – 10 CdCl2 glasses have been prepared by using melt quenching method and at 455 °C annealing temperature the crystallization of four glass samples were studied. The chloro-antimonate glass has a large optical window of cut-off wavelength 361 nm, multiphonons relaxation wavelength 7.51 μm, high optical band gap 3.25 eV and a high refractive index close to 1.7 in the visible and near infrared. The devitrification study remains complementary and essential in order to assess the conditions of application of the glass. SEM micrographs are noted at different treatment times between 10 and 25 min. Crystallization starts on the surface crystals of different morphology viz., polyhedral, needle, lath-like and rarely hemispherical. The surface porosity promotes the formation of needle crystals, while those in lath-like are developed in the cavities. The germination and growth of polyhedral crystals take place in rough areas of the surface. Roughness is a pre-germination process; and it accelerates crystallization compared to smooth surfaces.
Crystallization develops from the surface towards the interior in the form of overlapping lamellae and are grouped together in sets, each has the outer profile of a root. Growth takes place in transverse directions until the lamellae of different roots meet. After 25 min of annealing, a crystalline film is formed covering the surface with an average thickness of 70 μm. X-ray diffraction pattern shows the single-phase nature of the crystallization structure in the form of Valentinite. The kinetic parameters of crystallization via DSC measurements were calculated for different heating rates 2, 4, 6 and 8 °C/min and the average crystallization energy is found 150 KJ/mol shows good stability against devitrification. The Arami's index has an average value 3.405 attributes to crystallization in rough areas of the surface.

Body:
The crystallization of a glass is an exothermic phenomenon leading to the thermodynamic equilibrium of the material and is carried out by nucleation, growth, and managed by several different mechanisms [1–3]. The earliest proof of Winberg, Zanatto and Fokin [4–6] studies, addressing the fundamental aspect of nucleation whereas the Johnson - Mehl - Avrami - Kolmogorov [7] model describes the kinetics of phase transition accounting for the nucleation and growth. The crystallization of glass is a crucial importance for optimizing nano and microstructured glass-ceramics [6–17] and also making an optical fiber drawing is a technologically challenging matter [18,19]. However, Sb2O3 antimonate glasses have potential optronic applications, due to their nonlinear third order (χ3) susceptibility, low phonon energy and broad optical window i.e. from visible to mid-infrared wavelength range [20–24].

Over the past two decades the research dealing with the crystallization of antimonate based glasses; represent a limited number of articles [18,25–29]. Therefore, we gave the emphasis to the crystallization and the present article is devoted to the crystallization study of 80 Sb2O3 – 10 CdCl2 – 10 SrCl2 glasses. Before approaching the crystallization study, we proceeded to an optical characterization for the calculation of the refractive index, the limits of the optical window and the optical band gap, whereas amorphous nature and glass transition temperature details were reported in our previous article [20].

In the present studies a crystallization annealing temperature 455 °C has been applied to the four vitreous samples to the treatment time varies from 10 min to 25 min by an interval of 5 min. The mechanisms of crystal growth and morphologies have been explored by using SEM studies and also crystallization of the glasses was discussed. X-ray diffraction pattern has shown that glass crystallizes in Valentinite the one of the allotropic forms of antimonate.

The final part of the present work is emphases to the determination of the kinetic parameters of crystallization, namely the crystallization activation energy and the Avrami's index by using the Chen's [30], Ozawa's [31] methods for different heating rates via Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements.

Glass sample synthesis is carried out with reagent grade chemicals, following melt-quenching method and the details are mentioned in our previous work [20]. The refractive index of the prepared sample was determined by measuring the critical angle Θc for the sample/prism interface using different laser beam wavelengths, especially 633 nm; 1311 nm and 1551 nm by using the instrument Metricon-2010 model. This apparatus operates as a refractometer, providing accurate measurement of refractive index (±0.001). The prism index must be higher than the expected glass index, for total internal reflection of the input beam will occur, and the detector will receive a large intensity. It is important to note that adequate pressure must be applied between the prism and glass for coupling to occur. This pressure serves to minimize the air gap between the two materials, resulting a maximum coupling between the prism and sample. Optical transmission in the UV–visible range was recorded between 350 nm and 800 nm by a PerkinElmer spectrophotometer. Infrared absorption spectrum was measured between 400 cm−1 and 4000 cm−1 using a TENSOR 37 FTIR Infrared spectrophotometer.

We have given to four bulk samples of glass composition 80 Sb2O3 – 10 CdCl2 – 10 SrCl2 an isothermal annealing for devitrification at temperature 455 °C and it corresponds to TX + 5 °C (TX = onset point of crystallization) with respect to the crystallization peak at heating rate 2 °C/min. The annealing is done in chamber furnace with Nabertherm model. After heating, each sample was quenched in fresh air for conserving the structure at fixed times.

The only variable in this process is the treatment time and is taken as 10 min; 15 min; 20 min and 25 min. Before treatment the four samples have the same temperature and the samples have a disk shape with the diameter 10 mm and the thickness 5 mm. Each sample must be broken in two pieces by bending and then conferred a gold sputter deposit to facilitate the SEM examination. The micrographs were made both for the surface and the transverse side. JEOL JSM 840 model with a voltage of 7 kV is used for the SEM measurements. In other side DSC measurements were made for four different heating rates 2; 4; 6; and 8 K/min for the kinetic study. A DSC apparatus of Q2O model with sensitivity 0.1 °C with the argon atmosphere installation has been employed in the thermal studies. In these measurements we have encapsulated the coarse particles of glass within the well-sealed aluminum crucibles. XRD pattern is taken from a crystallized sample at room temperature by a Bruker D8 type diffractometer and the measuring is carried out by copper Kα radiation at the 1.54 A° wavelength. The generator settings are under 40 kV, and 40 mA voltage and current respectively. The standard scanning angle (2θ) is done from 8° to 90°; with step size of 0.02°.

The preliminary results (reported in Table 1
                        ) of this study related to the fundamental optical properties of the prepared glass sample. The energy band gap between the valence and conduction electronic layers of a material affects the UV–visible and can be determined by the Urbach method. From the UV–visible transmission curve (Fig. 1
                        ) the cut-off wavelength361 nm is determined by extrapolation the tangent for intercepting the x-axis. Similarly, the optical gap energy 3.25 eV is determined by the Tauc plot (Fig. 2
                        ) [32]. The multiphonon relaxation wavelength 7.61 μm corresponds to the zero value of infrared transmission is as shown in Fig. 3
                        .

The infrared transmission curve has absorption bands consecutive to OH contamination between 3500 and 3200 cm−1 and SiO at the limit of 1800 cm−1. The presence of OH alters the optical window of the glass, and infrared transmission begins practically after this absorption band, starting at 3200 cm−1. These effects can be reduced with the use of a gold crucible and the addition of fluorinated agent during the synthesis of the glass in order to release hydrogen as shown by the following chemical reaction:

Refractive index measurements of a prepared sample show a little bit high value around 1.7 this value exceed those of conventional glasses.

After 10 min in annealing; we found that the crystallization occurs only on the surface, in prime areas. Fig. 4
                           .a shows the appearance of roughness of the glass surface and also observed their multiplication in other superficial area and a crystal growth takes place in this rough zone. It has formed a polyhedron and hemispherical shapes (Fig. 4.b). Another type of lath-shaped crystals is formed in the surface cavities (Fig. 4.c). In this process, the crystallization phenomenon remains confined in favors sites in surface and do not diffuse in the depth of the sample.

15 min afterwards the crystallization starts from the surface and diffuse in the depth of the sample, as shown in Fig. 5
                           .a. It is noted that the crystal growth is done by nested lamella. Whole crystalline region is taking the root form, since the length of the lamella decreases from the surface to the depth. The micrograph of Fig. 5.b shows an intense surface crystalline development, as needles and laths-like randomly oriented and interfere with each other. Fig. 5.c micrograph further clarifies this situation under high magnification.

Later 20 min, polyhedral crystals are formed in rough and smooth surface areas (Fig. 6
                           .a, b). Therefore crystallization on a smooth area appears late compared to that in a rough area. In Fig. 6.c, we found that the crystallization propagates in different directions towards the sample's core. This crystalline development starts from the same zone of germination of the superficial crystals. In this case the crystalline growth towards the depth is most intense with respect to the sample (2), whereas crystallization has been developed in isolated root.

In the next 25 min, the glass surface is completely covered by a crystalline film of thickness 70 μm (Fig. 7
                           .a). Fig. 7.b represents a magnification of the previous one; where lamellar crystals formant roots and this process leads the meeting of lamella of two adjacent roots. At this stage crystal/glass interfaces disappear, however the volume fraction of amorphous phase decreases. This process decreases the free energy of the system and makes it more stable. Fig. 7.c presents the opportunity for a more detail on the surface where the coalescence of different crystals is covered on the surface.

Fig. 8.a & 8.
                        b show the XRD patterns and the peaks are listed with the associate phase. However the identified structure is Valentinite, it is orthorhombic variety of antimonate Sb2O3. We used software installed in the machine for phase determination. Peaks research met the following criteria:

Minimum significance = 2, Minimum tip width = 0.01, Maximum tip width = 1, Peak base width = 2 and the method is second derivative minimum.

We emphasis a non-isothermal study for the determination of the kinetic parameters of glass's crystallization. DSC measurements were made for four heating rates, as shown in Fig. 9
                        .a. Table 2
                         reports the data extracted from the DSC curves, which are needed to calculate the crystallization energy and the Avrami's index. The peak area of crystallization is limited between the baseline of DSC and the heat flux curve.

The crystallization energy was calculated by linear regression at TP (temperature at a maximum flux of crystallization's peak); using Chen's [30] and Ozawa's [31] formulas (equations (1) and (2) respectively):

Fig. 9.c represents a plot of experimental data and their associate linear fittings used to determine the Avrami's indexes. These values are listed in Table 3
                         and the average of these values is 3.405. Usually this value indicates that the crystallization is made by interface-controlled and rate-increasing two dimensional nucleation mode.

The chloro-antimonate 80 Sb2O3 -10 CdCl2 -10 SrCl2 glass has interesting optical qualities. In particular its large optical window, which covers the visible range to mid-infrared. This property is a consequence of low phonon energy 600 cm−1 of the Sb–O bond [22]. The high value of the refractive index depends on the polarizability of the glassy former [20]. A high refractive index increases the probability of radiative transitions in glass matrices doped with lanthanides. These aspects make the study of mechanism and kinetics of crystallization of paramount importance.

The SEM examination confirms that the devitrification of the 80 Sb2O3 –10 SrCl2 – 10 CdCl2 glasses obeys the surface mechanism. Devitrification begins at specific sites on the surface and the main process consists of the formation of roughness and also which constitute favorable sites for the germination and growth of polyhedral crystals. The roughness appear in a limited area and then widens, following the thermal agitation of the super cooled liquid. From our point of view, the three concepts, namely, the kinetic theory of liquids, model describing surface and the theory explaining the creation of surface roughness following the matter exchange are necessary to explain this phenomenon. In the kinetic theory of liquids, atoms on the surface have low bond energy. They migrate under thermal agitation, which creates vacancies allowing the atoms of sub-adjacent layers to fill them [33]. At the atomic scale the surface of a material can be described by the TLK model (terrace - ledge - kink) and TSK model (terrace - step - kink) [34,35].

According to Elwell and Scheel [36] the arrival of material flow at the surface leads to the formation of clusters or bunches of steps (step is an element of TSK model) which will form a rough surface on a microscopic scale. The latter offers the diffusing entity several possibilities of chemical bonds, which initiate nucleation and growth. Therefore the crystallization process on rough surfaces is faster compared to smooth surfaces. The crystallization catalyst roughness appear spontaneously by thermal effect and constitutes a pre-nucleation process distinguishing chloro-antimonate glass. But amorphous phase separation (APS) and spinodal decomposition constitute the pre-nucleation processes for certain classic and special glasses. APS and spinodal decomposition appear throughout the volume [1,11]. On the other hand the mechanism of pre-nucleation of chloro-antimonate glass is of a superficial nature. Surface defects (at the micron scale) such as cavities and porosities are precursors to the germination and growth of crystals in the form of laths-like and needles. We believe that it is the confinement of roughness at the tips of these defects which promotes one-dimensional or pseudo one-dimensional (lath-like) crystal growth.

Generally the value of the Avrami's index n = 3.405 indicates that the growth is done by the exchange at the interface with a decreasing nucleation rate [37]. Depending on the specificity of the case physically there are other alternatives associated with this value. Indeed, high values of Avrami's index 3 ≤ n ≤ 4 can represent a specific mode of rapid crystallization. We cite the formation of precipitates in grain boundaries, and crystal growth on impurities [38]. In our case the rough zones accelerate and dominate the crystallization on the surface and also the calculated value of the Avrami's index n = 3.405.

The calculated values of the crystallization energy have a high energy barrier to crystallization; promoting good stability of the studied glass. However the lamellar growth mechanism inside the glass requires a large number of interfaces in molar volume; and increases the energy barrier. Each time additional energy require to form a new interface between lamellae. The DSC analysis presents a single crystallization peak for the different heating rates and X-ray diffraction patterns shows that the glass crystallizes into valentinite. The single-phase nature of the crystallization is returned to the quantitative dominance of antimonate (80% Sb2O3) and good solubility of the cadmium and strontium chlorides in this matrix. Indeed valentinite plays the role of solvent and the chlorides are the solutes.

80 Sb2O3 –10 SrCl2 – 10 CdCl2 glasses have been prepared by using melt quenching method and at 455 °C annealing temperature the crystallization of four glass samples were studied. The chloro-antimonate glass has a large optical window of cut-off wavelength 361 nm, multiphonons relaxation wavelength 7.51 μm, high optical band gap 3.25 eV and a high refractive index close to 1.7 in the visible and near infrared. The devitrification study remains complementary and essential in order to assess the conditions of application of the glass. SEM micrographs are noted at different treatment times between 10 and 25 min. Crystallization starts on the surface crystals of different morphology viz., polyhedral, needle, lath-like and rarely hemispherical. The surface porosity promotes the formation of needle crystals, while those in lath-like are developed in the cavities. The germination and growth of polyhedral crystals take place in rough areas of the surface. Roughness is a pre-germination process; and it accelerates crystallization compared to smooth surfaces.

Crystallization develops from the surface towards the interior in the form of overlapping lamellae and are grouped together in sets, each has the outer profile of a root. Growth takes place in transverse directions until the lamellae of different roots meet. After 25 min of annealing, a crystalline film is formed covering the surface with an average thickness of 70 μm. X-ray diffraction pattern shows the single-phase nature of the crystallization structure in the form of Valentinite. The kinetic parameters of crystallization via DSC measurements were calculated for different heating rates 2, 4, 6 and 8 °C/min and the average crystallization energy is found 150 KJ/mol shows good stability against devitrification. The Arami's index has an average value 3.405 attributes to crystallization in rough areas of the surface.

Title:
First International Symposium on Transparent Conducting Oxides

Abstract:
Porous layers were prepared from DEGUSSA's ITO (In2O3:Sn) nanoparticle dispersion by doctor blading followed by annealing in air. We investigated the influence of various annealing parameters on electrical, optical and morphological thin film properties.
                  Conductance rises with increasing annealing temperature and time by more than three orders of magnitude up to 44 Ω−1cm−1. Besides this we found an abrupt decrease in free charge carrier concentration above a critical annealing temperature of 250 °C, which leads to a step in conductance curve. In spite of particle growing during annealing no decrease in porosity was observed and in opposite to compact material, nanoparticle layers do not exhibit an appreciable shrinkage below recrystallisation temperature. These both indicate a densification hindering particle pinning effect, which is believed to be currently the main obstruction to achieve higher electrical conductivities.

Introduction:
Layers from transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are very important in modern electronic industry due to the necessity of transparent electrodes in many new applications like TFTs, OLED-displays, organic solar cells, electroluminescence lamps and some more. Tin doped indium oxide In2O3:Sn (ITO) layers exhibit best conductance among all the TCOs at coexistant good transmittance properties. They are classically deposited by PVD techniques as magnetron sputtering [1] or evaporation [2]. These methods are cost intensive due to inevitable vacuum process, but lead to very good layer conductance of ∼104 Ω−1cm−1 
                     [1,2]. Novel deposition techniques with a high cost reduction potential are the wet deposition methods like sol–gel-technique [3–5] and coating of nanoparticle dispersions [5–7]. They both combine the advantages of omittable vacuum step and printing possibility, which offers large area layer manufacturing in a continuous process and direct patterning ability.
Wet deposited films normally need some annealing steps after deposition for getting better conductivity and optical properties. In this paper the effects of various annealing parameters on electrical, optical and morphological properties of nanocrystalline ITO layers are characterised and discussed.

Experimental:
Investigated layers were made by doctor blading a commercial (DEGUSSA Creavis) ethanolic nanoparticle ITO dispersion on glass, silica as well as alumina substrates. Glass substrates with a size of 75 mm×25 mm were used for annealing up to 550 °C. At higher annealing temperatures 20 mm×10 mm sized silica substrates and 58 mm×24 mm alumina substrates were used due to temperature stability. Samples on alumina substrates were made for verification the results of silica substrate samples. Substrate thicknesses all were 1 mm. Using various substrates was unproblematic, because no influence of substrate material on the ITO layer properties was observed.
Depending on dilution of ITO dispersion and doctor blading process parameters, such as casting velocity and blade gap height, layer thickness could be varied from 800 nm to about 6 μm. Thicknesses were determined with a DekTak mechanical profilometer and kept approximately constant for every sample batch. Conductance measurements in air were done in a linear four-point setup using a Keithley SMU 236. Low temperature electrical measurements, however, were carried out in vacuum with a van-der-Pauw four-point setup, a Keithley 220 current source, a Keithley 196 System DMM and a Keithley 705 scanner device. Optical transmittance measurements were performed using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 UV-VIS-IR spectrometer in a wavelength range of 200 nm to 3000 nm.

Results and discussion:
3.1
                     Electrical properties
                     The electrical conductance of nanoparticle ITO layers is strongly impacted by the annealing parameters after deposition, especially duration time, temperature and kind of atmosphere. The as-deposited layer conductance is about 0.02 Ω−1cm−1 and rises up to 44 Ω−1cm−1, if annealed at 1000 °C for 60 min in air (see Fig. 1
                        ). This conductivity corresponds to a sheet resistance of nearly 50 Ω/□. The conductance increase can easily be explained by formation of sinternecks between nanoparticle aggregates or the nanoparticles itselves, which leads to a larger contact cross-section area and hence lower resistance. Sinterneck generation, marked as process 1 in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2
                        , is a relative fast process, as Fig. 2 indicates. Already after 5 min of annealing at 550 °C conductance raises more than 100 times. 550 °C is particular interesting, because it is the maximum working temperature for common low coast sodium silicate glass.
                     At medium annealing temperatures above 250 °C for 60 min or at 550 °C for more than 30 min the conductance decreases again, which leads to a step in the characteristics (marked as process 2 in Figs. 1 and 2). This is presumably a consequence of a decrease in number of free charge carriers. In ITO this number strongly depends on quantity of indium substituting tin atoms as well as oxygen vacancy concentration. Both lattice defects create free electrons, which contribute to charge transport. Whereas tin doping level is constant and adjusted to an optimum in conductivity, oxygen vacancy concentration is impacted by the environment like oxygen partial pressure and temperature. Depending on direction of oxygen gradient, high temperatures kinetically enables diffusion of oxygen into or out of the material.
                     However, above a critical temperature of 250 °C in air, oxygen diffuses into the ITO lattice, reduces the number of oxygen vacancies and leads to a decrease in charge carrier concentration and hence conductivity. The optical transmittance measurements shown in Figs. 3 and 4
                        
                         support this statement. The free electron absorption onset shifts from about 1100 to 2000 nm, which denotes an abrupt decrease in charge carrier concentration. This shift comes along with a colour switching from blue to yellowish. Admittedly the free electron absorption onset shift is faster than the measurable decrease in conductivity (see Fig. 4). It occurs already after 5 min, whereas conductance decrease exhibit soonest after 30 min (see Fig. 2). The reasons for that phenomenon is still unclear.
                     After this step in conductance characteristics, conductivity rises again with increasing annealing temperatures up to 1000 °C. The latter is related to further contact area increase on the one hand and grain enlargement due to Oswald ripening on the other hand. As the grains become larger, the number of grain boundaries decreases and therewith grain boundary electron scattering. This enhances charge carrier mobility and hence conductivity.

                     Optical properties
                     As-deposited nanoparticle ITO layers are blue coloured. Layers with a thickness of approximately 3 μm exhibit a transmittance of around 80% at 600 nm wavelength and a high infrared absorption (see Fig. 3). The free electron absorption onset is located at about 1100 nm. After annealing for 60 min with more than 300 °C, maximum transmittance increases to about 90%, whereas annealing with 750 °C leads to highest values of 91%. During annealing the free electron absorption onset shifts to about 2000 nm due to reduction of charge carrier concentration as explained above: The colour of the layers switches to yellowish.
                     Transmittance of thinner layers with a thickness of about 1 μm are naturally a little bit higher. Even as-deposited layers have more than 90% transmittance in the maximum (see Fig. 4, these samples have layer thickness of about 1 μm). Thick layer as well as thin layer transmittance are high enough for usual ITO applications in touchscreens, TFT- and LCD-displays and OLEDs.

                     Morphological properties — porosity
                     
                        Fig. 5a–d shows SEM images of ITO layers annealed at various temperatures. Particle growth at temperatures above 550 °C is obvious, but between 1000 °C and 1200 °C layer morphology changes completely. ITO crystals arise with a size up to 1 μm and a completely different habitus than the original nanoparticles (see Fig. 5e and f), which indicates a kind of recrystallisation. At 1200 °C the annealed layer is no more transparent, because of light scattering at the μm-sized crystals. The conductance decreases partially to 27 Ω−1cm−1, whereas the exact reason is not clear so far.
                     Another result derived from the SEM pictures is, that no pronounced densification seems to takes place at high annealing temperatures. To confirm this assumption, porosity values ρ of some ITO-samples were calculated from their refractive indices n

                        ). For each ITO sample the refractive index n
                        l was calculated at three different wavelength and averaged.
                     The calculated porosity values are summarised in Table 1
                        . Unfortunately it is not possible to present a value for the sample annealed at 1200 °C, because the opaque nature due to light scattering on μm-sized crystals did not allow optical transmission measurement. As presumed after the analysis of the SEM images, no porosity decrease can be found with increasing annealing temperatures. This result is quite surprising, since it is well known from other ceramic particle systems, that sintering of the so called green body leads to a significant shrinkage and hence decrease in porosity. However, besides the missing porosity decrease, nanoparticle ITO layers also do not exhibit an appreciable shrinkage (thickness decrease) below the recrystallisation temperature between 1000 and 1200 °C, as pointed out in Fig. 7
                        .
                     These both suggest a kind of mechanical pinning effect, which hinders restructuring of particles and aggregates. A compact of ITO nanoparticles on the other hand shows shrinkage already at temperatures of 800 °C (see Fig. 7), which suggests, that particle pinning in the layer presumably is caused by substrate–particle-adhesion. The obvious lack of aggregate moving possibility along x- and y-direction also leads to an immobility in z-direction. As a consequence, no densification can take place, which is believed to be currently the main obstruction to achieve higher electrical conductivities in nanoparticle ITO layers.

                     Temperature dependent resistance measurements — carrier transport
                     Temperature dependant resistance measurements of ITO layers were performed in the temperature range of 53 K to 260 K (see Fig. 8
                        ). All samples exhibit a negative temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), indicating a semiconducting material. The slope of TCR becomes smaller with increasing annealing temperatures. This is in good agreement to measurements on nanoparticle ITO layers of Ederth et al. [6]. He also discussed different transport models leading to a negative TCR, especially ionized impurity scattering, variable-range hopping, nearest neighbour hopping, a granular–metal system and a model in which metallic conducting nanoparticles form internally connected clusters which are separated by thin isolating barriers. In this model charge transport is dominated by fluctuation induced tunnelling between the metallic regions (clusters). The resistance is given by [11]:

                        1 are impacted by area, height and width of the insulating barrier. As Ederth et al. [6], we also confirm a good agreement between theoretical fits and measurements. Fig. 9
                         shows the relative specific resistance versus temperature measurements (continuous lines) and best fits (dots) using Eq. (4), following the fluctuation induced tunnelling model. The corresponding fitting parameters are given in Table 2
                        . It is evident that this model is able to describe carrier transport in nanoparticle ITO layers very well.
                     In the AFM images (see Fig. 10
                        ) we found a structure of higher order than primary particle structure. Particles have an average size of only 10 nm to 20 nm if annealed at 550 °C and 40 nm respectively if annealed at 750 °C (compare Fig. 5b and c), whereas AFM feature size is found to exhibit a structure dimension of 150 nm or even 180 nm. This confirms the presence of the presumed clusters from the fluctuation tunnelling model, although cluster sizes discussed by Ederth et al. [6] should have a size of several micrometers for applicability to the model. However, size difference between presumed and found cluster structure is only one order of magnitude.

Electrical properties:
The electrical conductance of nanoparticle ITO layers is strongly impacted by the annealing parameters after deposition, especially duration time, temperature and kind of atmosphere. The as-deposited layer conductance is about 0.02 Ω−1cm−1 and rises up to 44 Ω−1cm−1, if annealed at 1000 °C for 60 min in air (see Fig. 1
                        ). This conductivity corresponds to a sheet resistance of nearly 50 Ω/□. The conductance increase can easily be explained by formation of sinternecks between nanoparticle aggregates or the nanoparticles itselves, which leads to a larger contact cross-section area and hence lower resistance. Sinterneck generation, marked as process 1 in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2
                        , is a relative fast process, as Fig. 2 indicates. Already after 5 min of annealing at 550 °C conductance raises more than 100 times. 550 °C is particular interesting, because it is the maximum working temperature for common low coast sodium silicate glass.
At medium annealing temperatures above 250 °C for 60 min or at 550 °C for more than 30 min the conductance decreases again, which leads to a step in the characteristics (marked as process 2 in Figs. 1 and 2). This is presumably a consequence of a decrease in number of free charge carriers. In ITO this number strongly depends on quantity of indium substituting tin atoms as well as oxygen vacancy concentration. Both lattice defects create free electrons, which contribute to charge transport. Whereas tin doping level is constant and adjusted to an optimum in conductivity, oxygen vacancy concentration is impacted by the environment like oxygen partial pressure and temperature. Depending on direction of oxygen gradient, high temperatures kinetically enables diffusion of oxygen into or out of the material.
However, above a critical temperature of 250 °C in air, oxygen diffuses into the ITO lattice, reduces the number of oxygen vacancies and leads to a decrease in charge carrier concentration and hence conductivity. The optical transmittance measurements shown in Figs. 3 and 4
                        
                         support this statement. The free electron absorption onset shifts from about 1100 to 2000 nm, which denotes an abrupt decrease in charge carrier concentration. This shift comes along with a colour switching from blue to yellowish. Admittedly the free electron absorption onset shift is faster than the measurable decrease in conductivity (see Fig. 4). It occurs already after 5 min, whereas conductance decrease exhibit soonest after 30 min (see Fig. 2). The reasons for that phenomenon is still unclear.
After this step in conductance characteristics, conductivity rises again with increasing annealing temperatures up to 1000 °C. The latter is related to further contact area increase on the one hand and grain enlargement due to Oswald ripening on the other hand. As the grains become larger, the number of grain boundaries decreases and therewith grain boundary electron scattering. This enhances charge carrier mobility and hence conductivity.

Optical properties:
As-deposited nanoparticle ITO layers are blue coloured. Layers with a thickness of approximately 3 μm exhibit a transmittance of around 80% at 600 nm wavelength and a high infrared absorption (see Fig. 3). The free electron absorption onset is located at about 1100 nm. After annealing for 60 min with more than 300 °C, maximum transmittance increases to about 90%, whereas annealing with 750 °C leads to highest values of 91%. During annealing the free electron absorption onset shifts to about 2000 nm due to reduction of charge carrier concentration as explained above: The colour of the layers switches to yellowish.
Transmittance of thinner layers with a thickness of about 1 μm are naturally a little bit higher. Even as-deposited layers have more than 90% transmittance in the maximum (see Fig. 4, these samples have layer thickness of about 1 μm). Thick layer as well as thin layer transmittance are high enough for usual ITO applications in touchscreens, TFT- and LCD-displays and OLEDs.

Morphological properties — porosity:
Fig. 5a–d shows SEM images of ITO layers annealed at various temperatures. Particle growth at temperatures above 550 °C is obvious, but between 1000 °C and 1200 °C layer morphology changes completely. ITO crystals arise with a size up to 1 μm and a completely different habitus than the original nanoparticles (see Fig. 5e and f), which indicates a kind of recrystallisation. At 1200 °C the annealed layer is no more transparent, because of light scattering at the μm-sized crystals. The conductance decreases partially to 27 Ω−1cm−1, whereas the exact reason is not clear so far.
Another result derived from the SEM pictures is, that no pronounced densification seems to takes place at high annealing temperatures. To confirm this assumption, porosity values ρ of some ITO-samples were calculated from their refractive indices n

                        min are the maximum and minimum values respectively of the transmittance spectrum's envelopes at a fixed wavelength (see Fig. 6
                        ). For each ITO sample the refractive index n
                        l was calculated at three different wavelength and averaged.
The calculated porosity values are summarised in Table 1
                        . Unfortunately it is not possible to present a value for the sample annealed at 1200 °C, because the opaque nature due to light scattering on μm-sized crystals did not allow optical transmission measurement. As presumed after the analysis of the SEM images, no porosity decrease can be found with increasing annealing temperatures. This result is quite surprising, since it is well known from other ceramic particle systems, that sintering of the so called green body leads to a significant shrinkage and hence decrease in porosity. However, besides the missing porosity decrease, nanoparticle ITO layers also do not exhibit an appreciable shrinkage (thickness decrease) below the recrystallisation temperature between 1000 and 1200 °C, as pointed out in Fig. 7
                        .
These both suggest a kind of mechanical pinning effect, which hinders restructuring of particles and aggregates. A compact of ITO nanoparticles on the other hand shows shrinkage already at temperatures of 800 °C (see Fig. 7), which suggests, that particle pinning in the layer presumably is caused by substrate–particle-adhesion. The obvious lack of aggregate moving possibility along x- and y-direction also leads to an immobility in z-direction. As a consequence, no densification can take place, which is believed to be currently the main obstruction to achieve higher electrical conductivities in nanoparticle ITO layers.

Temperature dependent resistance measurements — carrier transport:
Temperature dependant resistance measurements of ITO layers were performed in the temperature range of 53 K to 260 K (see Fig. 8
                        ). All samples exhibit a negative temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), indicating a semiconducting material. The slope of TCR becomes smaller with increasing annealing temperatures. This is in good agreement to measurements on nanoparticle ITO layers of Ederth et al. [6]. He also discussed different transport models leading to a negative TCR, especially ionized impurity scattering, variable-range hopping, nearest neighbour hopping, a granular–metal system and a model in which metallic conducting nanoparticles form internally connected clusters which are separated by thin isolating barriers. In this model charge transport is dominated by fluctuation induced tunnelling between the metallic regions (clusters). The resistance is given by [11]:

                        1 are impacted by area, height and width of the insulating barrier. As Ederth et al. [6], we also confirm a good agreement between theoretical fits and measurements. Fig. 9
                         shows the relative specific resistance versus temperature measurements (continuous lines) and best fits (dots) using Eq. (4), following the fluctuation induced tunnelling model. The corresponding fitting parameters are given in Table 2
                        . It is evident that this model is able to describe carrier transport in nanoparticle ITO layers very well.
In the AFM images (see Fig. 10
                        ) we found a structure of higher order than primary particle structure. Particles have an average size of only 10 nm to 20 nm if annealed at 550 °C and 40 nm respectively if annealed at 750 °C (compare Fig. 5b and c), whereas AFM feature size is found to exhibit a structure dimension of 150 nm or even 180 nm. This confirms the presence of the presumed clusters from the fluctuation tunnelling model, although cluster sizes discussed by Ederth et al. [6] should have a size of several micrometers for applicability to the model. However, size difference between presumed and found cluster structure is only one order of magnitude.

Summary:
Transparent and conducting ITO layers were prepared from a nanoparticle dispersion by using doctor blading technique. Impact of annealing parameters, especially temperature and time on electrical, optical and morphological properties was investigated. Conductance rises from 0.02 Ω−1cm−1 up to 44 Ω−1cm−1, if annealed at 1000 °C for 60 min. This corresponds to a sheet resistance of nearly 50 Ω/□. On sodium silicate glass substrates, with an annealing temperature limit of 550 °C, layers with 17 Ω−1cm−1, corresponding to ∼150 Ω/□, were realised. Conductance increase is consequence of sinter-neck generation and crystal growth. A small contrary step in conductance-temperature-characteristics takes place due to decrease of charge carrier concentration by oxygen diffusion into the ITO. Optical transmittance of annealed layers evidently depends on layer thickness, but is usually more than 90% in the visible range.
In opposite to compact ITO material, nanoparticle layers do not exhibit an appreciable shrinkage below recrystallisation temperature between 1000 °C and 1200 °C. This indicates a kind of particle pinning effect by substrate adhesion. As a consequence, no porosity decrease takes place during annealing and hence no material densification. This is believed to be the main obstruction to achieve higher electrical conductivities.
In agreement with Ederth et al. [6] a transport model was assumed, where fluctuation induced carrier tunnelling through thin insulating barriers between clusters of metallic conducting nanoparticles limits charge carrier transport.
Today, nanoparticle ITO layers do not yet show the very good properties of ITO layers fabricated with physical vapor deposition techniques, but for some modest applications they are an alternative with a high cost reduction potential. If one succeeds in the future to densify nanoparticle derived layers during annealing, high-technical applications as TFT- or LCD-display electrodes may also be realised.

Body:
Layers from transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are very important in modern electronic industry due to the necessity of transparent electrodes in many new applications like TFTs, OLED-displays, organic solar cells, electroluminescence lamps and some more. Tin doped indium oxide In2O3:Sn (ITO) layers exhibit best conductance among all the TCOs at coexistant good transmittance properties. They are classically deposited by PVD techniques as magnetron sputtering [1] or evaporation [2]. These methods are cost intensive due to inevitable vacuum process, but lead to very good layer conductance of ∼104 Ω−1cm−1 
                     [1,2]. Novel deposition techniques with a high cost reduction potential are the wet deposition methods like sol–gel-technique [3–5] and coating of nanoparticle dispersions [5–7]. They both combine the advantages of omittable vacuum step and printing possibility, which offers large area layer manufacturing in a continuous process and direct patterning ability.

Wet deposited films normally need some annealing steps after deposition for getting better conductivity and optical properties. In this paper the effects of various annealing parameters on electrical, optical and morphological properties of nanocrystalline ITO layers are characterised and discussed.

Investigated layers were made by doctor blading a commercial (DEGUSSA Creavis) ethanolic nanoparticle ITO dispersion on glass, silica as well as alumina substrates. Glass substrates with a size of 75 mm×25 mm were used for annealing up to 550 °C. At higher annealing temperatures 20 mm×10 mm sized silica substrates and 58 mm×24 mm alumina substrates were used due to temperature stability. Samples on alumina substrates were made for verification the results of silica substrate samples. Substrate thicknesses all were 1 mm. Using various substrates was unproblematic, because no influence of substrate material on the ITO layer properties was observed.

Depending on dilution of ITO dispersion and doctor blading process parameters, such as casting velocity and blade gap height, layer thickness could be varied from 800 nm to about 6 μm. Thicknesses were determined with a DekTak mechanical profilometer and kept approximately constant for every sample batch. Conductance measurements in air were done in a linear four-point setup using a Keithley SMU 236. Low temperature electrical measurements, however, were carried out in vacuum with a van-der-Pauw four-point setup, a Keithley 220 current source, a Keithley 196 System DMM and a Keithley 705 scanner device. Optical transmittance measurements were performed using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 UV-VIS-IR spectrometer in a wavelength range of 200 nm to 3000 nm.

The electrical conductance of nanoparticle ITO layers is strongly impacted by the annealing parameters after deposition, especially duration time, temperature and kind of atmosphere. The as-deposited layer conductance is about 0.02 Ω−1cm−1 and rises up to 44 Ω−1cm−1, if annealed at 1000 °C for 60 min in air (see Fig. 1
                        ). This conductivity corresponds to a sheet resistance of nearly 50 Ω/□. The conductance increase can easily be explained by formation of sinternecks between nanoparticle aggregates or the nanoparticles itselves, which leads to a larger contact cross-section area and hence lower resistance. Sinterneck generation, marked as process 1 in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2
                        , is a relative fast process, as Fig. 2 indicates. Already after 5 min of annealing at 550 °C conductance raises more than 100 times. 550 °C is particular interesting, because it is the maximum working temperature for common low coast sodium silicate glass.

At medium annealing temperatures above 250 °C for 60 min or at 550 °C for more than 30 min the conductance decreases again, which leads to a step in the characteristics (marked as process 2 in Figs. 1 and 2). This is presumably a consequence of a decrease in number of free charge carriers. In ITO this number strongly depends on quantity of indium substituting tin atoms as well as oxygen vacancy concentration. Both lattice defects create free electrons, which contribute to charge transport. Whereas tin doping level is constant and adjusted to an optimum in conductivity, oxygen vacancy concentration is impacted by the environment like oxygen partial pressure and temperature. Depending on direction of oxygen gradient, high temperatures kinetically enables diffusion of oxygen into or out of the material.

However, above a critical temperature of 250 °C in air, oxygen diffuses into the ITO lattice, reduces the number of oxygen vacancies and leads to a decrease in charge carrier concentration and hence conductivity. The optical transmittance measurements shown in Figs. 3 and 4
                        
                         support this statement. The free electron absorption onset shifts from about 1100 to 2000 nm, which denotes an abrupt decrease in charge carrier concentration. This shift comes along with a colour switching from blue to yellowish. Admittedly the free electron absorption onset shift is faster than the measurable decrease in conductivity (see Fig. 4). It occurs already after 5 min, whereas conductance decrease exhibit soonest after 30 min (see Fig. 2). The reasons for that phenomenon is still unclear.

After this step in conductance characteristics, conductivity rises again with increasing annealing temperatures up to 1000 °C. The latter is related to further contact area increase on the one hand and grain enlargement due to Oswald ripening on the other hand. As the grains become larger, the number of grain boundaries decreases and therewith grain boundary electron scattering. This enhances charge carrier mobility and hence conductivity.

As-deposited nanoparticle ITO layers are blue coloured. Layers with a thickness of approximately 3 μm exhibit a transmittance of around 80% at 600 nm wavelength and a high infrared absorption (see Fig. 3). The free electron absorption onset is located at about 1100 nm. After annealing for 60 min with more than 300 °C, maximum transmittance increases to about 90%, whereas annealing with 750 °C leads to highest values of 91%. During annealing the free electron absorption onset shifts to about 2000 nm due to reduction of charge carrier concentration as explained above: The colour of the layers switches to yellowish.

Transmittance of thinner layers with a thickness of about 1 μm are naturally a little bit higher. Even as-deposited layers have more than 90% transmittance in the maximum (see Fig. 4, these samples have layer thickness of about 1 μm). Thick layer as well as thin layer transmittance are high enough for usual ITO applications in touchscreens, TFT- and LCD-displays and OLEDs.

Fig. 5a–d shows SEM images of ITO layers annealed at various temperatures. Particle growth at temperatures above 550 °C is obvious, but between 1000 °C and 1200 °C layer morphology changes completely. ITO crystals arise with a size up to 1 μm and a completely different habitus than the original nanoparticles (see Fig. 5e and f), which indicates a kind of recrystallisation. At 1200 °C the annealed layer is no more transparent, because of light scattering at the μm-sized crystals. The conductance decreases partially to 27 Ω−1cm−1, whereas the exact reason is not clear so far.

Another result derived from the SEM pictures is, that no pronounced densification seems to takes place at high annealing temperatures. To confirm this assumption, porosity values ρ of some ITO-samples were calculated from their refractive indices n

                        min are the maximum and minimum values respectively of the transmittance spectrum's envelopes at a fixed wavelength (see Fig. 6
                        ). For each ITO sample the refractive index n
                        l was calculated at three different wavelength and averaged.

The calculated porosity values are summarised in Table 1
                        . Unfortunately it is not possible to present a value for the sample annealed at 1200 °C, because the opaque nature due to light scattering on μm-sized crystals did not allow optical transmission measurement. As presumed after the analysis of the SEM images, no porosity decrease can be found with increasing annealing temperatures. This result is quite surprising, since it is well known from other ceramic particle systems, that sintering of the so called green body leads to a significant shrinkage and hence decrease in porosity. However, besides the missing porosity decrease, nanoparticle ITO layers also do not exhibit an appreciable shrinkage (thickness decrease) below the recrystallisation temperature between 1000 and 1200 °C, as pointed out in Fig. 7
                        .

These both suggest a kind of mechanical pinning effect, which hinders restructuring of particles and aggregates. A compact of ITO nanoparticles on the other hand shows shrinkage already at temperatures of 800 °C (see Fig. 7), which suggests, that particle pinning in the layer presumably is caused by substrate–particle-adhesion. The obvious lack of aggregate moving possibility along x- and y-direction also leads to an immobility in z-direction. As a consequence, no densification can take place, which is believed to be currently the main obstruction to achieve higher electrical conductivities in nanoparticle ITO layers.

Temperature dependant resistance measurements of ITO layers were performed in the temperature range of 53 K to 260 K (see Fig. 8
                        ). All samples exhibit a negative temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), indicating a semiconducting material. The slope of TCR becomes smaller with increasing annealing temperatures. This is in good agreement to measurements on nanoparticle ITO layers of Ederth et al. [6]. He also discussed different transport models leading to a negative TCR, especially ionized impurity scattering, variable-range hopping, nearest neighbour hopping, a granular–metal system and a model in which metallic conducting nanoparticles form internally connected clusters which are separated by thin isolating barriers. In this model charge transport is dominated by fluctuation induced tunnelling between the metallic regions (clusters). The resistance is given by [11]:

                        1 are impacted by area, height and width of the insulating barrier. As Ederth et al. [6], we also confirm a good agreement between theoretical fits and measurements. Fig. 9
                         shows the relative specific resistance versus temperature measurements (continuous lines) and best fits (dots) using Eq. (4), following the fluctuation induced tunnelling model. The corresponding fitting parameters are given in Table 2
                        . It is evident that this model is able to describe carrier transport in nanoparticle ITO layers very well.

In the AFM images (see Fig. 10
                        ) we found a structure of higher order than primary particle structure. Particles have an average size of only 10 nm to 20 nm if annealed at 550 °C and 40 nm respectively if annealed at 750 °C (compare Fig. 5b and c), whereas AFM feature size is found to exhibit a structure dimension of 150 nm or even 180 nm. This confirms the presence of the presumed clusters from the fluctuation tunnelling model, although cluster sizes discussed by Ederth et al. [6] should have a size of several micrometers for applicability to the model. However, size difference between presumed and found cluster structure is only one order of magnitude.

Transparent and conducting ITO layers were prepared from a nanoparticle dispersion by using doctor blading technique. Impact of annealing parameters, especially temperature and time on electrical, optical and morphological properties was investigated. Conductance rises from 0.02 Ω−1cm−1 up to 44 Ω−1cm−1, if annealed at 1000 °C for 60 min. This corresponds to a sheet resistance of nearly 50 Ω/□. On sodium silicate glass substrates, with an annealing temperature limit of 550 °C, layers with 17 Ω−1cm−1, corresponding to ∼150 Ω/□, were realised. Conductance increase is consequence of sinter-neck generation and crystal growth. A small contrary step in conductance-temperature-characteristics takes place due to decrease of charge carrier concentration by oxygen diffusion into the ITO. Optical transmittance of annealed layers evidently depends on layer thickness, but is usually more than 90% in the visible range.

In opposite to compact ITO material, nanoparticle layers do not exhibit an appreciable shrinkage below recrystallisation temperature between 1000 °C and 1200 °C. This indicates a kind of particle pinning effect by substrate adhesion. As a consequence, no porosity decrease takes place during annealing and hence no material densification. This is believed to be the main obstruction to achieve higher electrical conductivities.

In agreement with Ederth et al. [6] a transport model was assumed, where fluctuation induced carrier tunnelling through thin insulating barriers between clusters of metallic conducting nanoparticles limits charge carrier transport.

Today, nanoparticle ITO layers do not yet show the very good properties of ITO layers fabricated with physical vapor deposition techniques, but for some modest applications they are an alternative with a high cost reduction potential. If one succeeds in the future to densify nanoparticle derived layers during annealing, high-technical applications as TFT- or LCD-display electrodes may also be realised.

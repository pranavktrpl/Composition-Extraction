Title:
Kinetic parameters and luminescence properties of rare earth (Tb  Nd) doped and transition metal (Mn) doped/co-doped YAlO

Abstract:
In this work, phosphor materials with the formula YAlO3 were synthesized via sol-gel method by using the stoichiometric amounts of yttrium nitrate and aluminum nitrate as base materials. The obtained phosphors were doped/co-doped with Tb3+, Nd3+ rare earth ions and Mn2+ transition metal ion. For evaluating the influence of the dopants, the grain size and morphology of the samples by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the phase and crystallinity of the synthesized materials by X-ray diffraction (XRD) were investigated. Optical absorption spectra, photoluminescence (PL) and thermoluminescence (TL) were performed to determine a relationship the changing dopant on luminescence properties of YAlO3. Moreover, the kinetic parameters namely activation energy (E), order of kinetics (b) and frequency factor (s) of the synthesized pure and doped materials were calculated using Computerized Glow Curve Deconvolution (CGCD) and Peak Shape Method for a better understanding of the optical properties that change with the doping process. Strong green emission was detected in the sample doped with Mn2+ correspond to 4T1(G)→6A1(S) transition. As for YAlO3: Nd3+, characteristic emissions originated from 4G11/2 → 4I9/2 (∼423 nm), 4G9/2 → 4I9/2 (∼460 nm) and 4G7/2 → 4I9/2 (∼540 nm) transitions were seen. The optical band gap of undoped sample was calculated as 2.79 eV and depending on the presence of Nd3+ and Tb3+ dopant ions this value was decreased to the range 2.46–2.56 eV.

Introduction:
In the recent years there has been an increasing interest in designing and developing of new efficient luminescent materials consist of the host and doped ion. The choice of the host lattice and suitable emitting ions plays an important role to achieve a qualified phosphor which has high application potential in the field of LED-lighting, luminescent devices and plasma display panels (PDPS).
Among many hosts, RAlO3 (R = Gd, Tb, Lu or Y) perovskites have emerged as a excellent host that can be used as an extensive luminescent material in lighting and micro imaging [1]. The Al2O3–Y2O3 binary system has been used as starting materials due to their thermal conductivity and high temperature resistance, etc. [2,3]. In the yttria (Y2O3) - alumina (Al2O3) phase diagram, there are four different crystalline phases: YAP (Yttrium Aluminum Perovskite: YAlO3) with orthorhombic perovskite structure, YAH (Yttrium Aluminum Hexagonal: YAlO3) with metastable hexagonal structure, YAG (Yttrium Aluminum Garnet: Y3Al5O12) with cubic garnet structure and YAM (Yttrium Aluminium Monoclinic: Y4Al2O9) with monoclinic structure. Among these, YAlO3 (yttrium orthoaluminate perovskite), with good mechanical and thermal properties, natural birefringence and anisotropy, is well-suited material for being used as host for lasers, fast scintillators and phosphors [4,5].
The dopant ion converts the absorbed energy to the light, while the host absorb the target radiation. Furthermore, the response efficiency to the light increases due to the addition of co-activator with the dopant for enhancing the trap concentration [6]. Doping of rare earth ion helps in improving the efficiency of phosphor resulted from a partially filled 4fn (1 < n < 14) shell of the ion. Because it is known that 4f electrons are well shielded by 5s2 and 5p6 orbitals; depending on the 4f–4f inner-shell transitions rare earth elements have been widely used as dopant in phosphors to optimize the properties (high luminescence yield, narrow emission line, and long decay time constant) [7–9]. Recently, it has been observed that there has been an increase in studies on phosphor materials doped with rare earth ions due to their wide application areas (solid-state lighting, photovoltaic systems, solar cells, display, luminescent materials, catalysts, laser materials, radiation dosimeters etc.) [10,11]. Up on going through the literature, it has become obvious that YAP crystals are frequently doped with transition metal and rare-earth elements [1,4,12–15]. Presence of two trivalent cations is leading to doping like this; transition metal and rare earth ions are doped at the Al and Y site, respectively.
Until now, most publications on the synthesis of rare earth and transition metal doped YAlO3 have focused the Czochralski growing process that is used for the growth of the single crystal [16–23]. However, this technique has two main drawbacks; high temperature of crystallization (larger than 2000 °C) and expensive production. Compared with the Czochralski growing process, sol–gel method has obvious advantages such as, requiring considerably lower temperature, good crystallinity, uniform and small sized (microns) precipitated particles, homogeneity, lower cost. Thus, the sample is prepared faster and cheaper by sol-gel method. Besides, phosphor particle size plays efficient role to control luminescent characteristic of lighting displays and devices and sol-gel route appears to be a rewarding method to obtain small sized particles [24–27].
Thermoluminescence dosimetry used for measuring the absorbed radiation dose and dating applications is based on the thermoluminescence (TL) phenomenon referred to the process of releasing trapped electrons and holes by thermal energy. Having some advantages like small size, low cost, reusability, high sensivity and easy reachability makes TL dosimeters a good candidate to for radiation dosimetry [28,29]. In literature there are reports on the thermoluminescence of many phosphors like aluminates, silicates, sulfates, borates, phosphates, fluorides [24,25,30–37]. The metallic oxides-based TL material has received lots of attention due to their characteristics and their possible applications for radiation dosimetry [38], especially aluminate groups have significant properties such as chemically and thermally stability, high luminescence intensity, high quantum efficiency [39,40]. With the best knowledge for personal dosimetry, a tissue-equivalent material is mainly required [41]. Rare earth and transition metal ion doped YAlO3 phosphors also have strong termoluminescent sensitivity and negligible fading [42,43]. As to YAlO3:Mn2+ phosphors, although they are not a tissue-equivalent materials, it can be considered that YAlO3:Mn2+ is a good candidate for middle- and high-dose dosimetry of ionizing radiation due to repeatability, thermal fading, dose dependence, and effect of daylight exposure [44–46].
In this work, we report on the aqueous based sol-gel synthesis that is accepted one of the easiest route to acquire homogeneous chemical composition [47] and luminescence (TL, PL) properties of YAlO3 phosphor doped/co-doped with Tb3+/Nd3+/Mn2+. Moreover, optical absorption measurements have been made and the energy band gaps of the phosphors have been calculated. Kinetic parameters consisting of kinetic degree (b), activation energy (E) and frequency factor (s) have been analyzed using the computerized glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) and peak shape method.

Experimental procedure:
2.1
                     Preparation and synthesis of Tb3+, Nd3+ and Mn2+ doped YAlO3
                     
                     Pure, rare earth (Tb3+, Nd3+) and transition metal (Mn2+) doped/co-doped YAlO3 were synthesized by the sol-gel method by using yttrium nitrate [Y(NO3)3·4H2O (purity 99.99%)], aluminum nitrate [Al(NO3)3·9H2O (purity 99+%)] as preparatory materials and nitric acid (HNO3) as a chelating agent. The aqueous solution for undoped and doped YAlO3 phosphor were prepared using double distilled. The stoichiometric amounts of Y(NO3)3·4H2O was dissolved in distilled water (30 ml), then nitric acid was added into the solution with a 1:3 ratio of ions. Al(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in another beaker and then this solution was slowly added to the Y(NO3)3·4H2O + nitric acid solution mixture with continuous magnetic stirring at room temperature. The dopants were dissolved in 10 ml of ionized water and added to the prepared solution. At last, polyethylene glycol solution was added to the resultant mixture solution to get a better particle structure as a surfactant material. After stirring for 2 h, the solutions were heated at 90 °C for 8–12 h. In this period a clear gel was obtained with water evaporation and then the resultant transparent solutions were kept at 100 °C for about 24 h in an oven until homogeneously dried gels were formed. In order to remove the nitrate in them, the solutions were completely dried by increasing the heat by 10 °C from 90 °C to 200 °C in 40-min steps. Finally, Differential Thermal Analysis/Thermogravimeter Analyze (DTA/TGA) of the produced xerogel powders were performed in order to determine the heat treatment process of the synthesized materials.

                     Characterization methodology
                     The crystal phase and composition of the prepared phosphors were systematically studied by recording the XRD patterns using a PANanalytical Empyrean X-ray diffraction (XRD) appliance operated at 45 kV tube voltage and 40 mA tube current. Cu-Kα (1.5405 Å) was used as the radiation source. The data were collected from 10° to 80° (2θ in steps of 0.01313o; 75.225 s per step; 0.0445°/s scan speed and 5331 number of steps.) Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG) were carried out using Exstar S11 TG/DTA 7300 instrument to study the thermal transformation of the synthesized phosphor. The samples were heated up to 1000 °C using a heating rate of 10 °C/min under inert atmosphere (Ar). The optical absorption properties of doped and undoped YAlO3 were studied by using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer operating from 800 to 200 nm. PL data of the prepared phosphors were collected at room temperature using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 spectrofluorometer equipped with a 488 nm xenon lamp (excitation spectra) and a xenon microsecond flash lamp (decay times). TL measurements were conducted with an RA94 Reader/Analyser system that was programmed to perform a linear heat from 50 °C to 400 °C with constant heating hate of 2 °C/s in N2 atmosphere. The morphology of the samples was characterized by the Nova NanoSEM 650 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). SEM images were taken by using the Gemini SEM500. SE (secondary electron) detector was selected for SEM images, and the working distance (WD) was set to about 8.1 mm. For doped phosphorus, images were taken at 20Kx magnifications.

                     Determination of kinetic parameters
                     Calculation of kinetic parameters consisting of kinetic order (b), thermal activation energy (E), and frequency factor (s) of a thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) is very important for kinetic characterization of the material and production of more efficient dosimeters. In this work, the most widely used peak shape method [48] and computerized glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) [49] have been used to obtain the kinetic parameters by utilizing the TL glow curves of the synthesized pure and doped materials.
                     
                        2.3.1
                        Peak shape method
                        This method is commonly used to determine thermal activation energy (E), frequency factor (s) and kinetic order (b) based on shape and geometrical parameters of the glow peak. These parameters are calculated using shape parameters:
                        ω = T2 – T1 (the total width at half the maximum intensity).
                        δ = T2 – Tm (half width on the falling side of the glow peak).
                        τ = Tm – T1 (half width on the rising side of the glow peak).
                        μ = δ/ω (symmetry factor).where T1, T2 and Tm refers to temperature at half the maximum intensity on the rising part of the peak, temperature at half the maximum intensity on the falling part of the peak, temperature at the maximum intensity, respectively. The kinetics of the peak are determined by the calculated μ symmetry factor; it equals 0.42 for first order kinetics and 0.52 for second order kinetics.
                        The activation energy (E) for any order of kinetics is [48].

                        Computerized glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) method
                        The main TL glow curve is composed of many overlapping glow peaks based on the factors such as ion impurities, atomic displacement or vacancy defects in the material. The CGCD method is a frequently used method to determine the number of glow peaks in the main TL curve and to estimate trap parameters activation energy (E), frequency factor (s) and kinetic order (b). For defining the best CGDC fitting, the figure of merit (FOM) [50,51] has been used and is given by

Preparation and synthesis of Tb3+, Nd3+ and Mn2+ doped YAlO3:
Pure, rare earth (Tb3+, Nd3+) and transition metal (Mn2+) doped/co-doped YAlO3 were synthesized by the sol-gel method by using yttrium nitrate [Y(NO3)3·4H2O (purity 99.99%)], aluminum nitrate [Al(NO3)3·9H2O (purity 99+%)] as preparatory materials and nitric acid (HNO3) as a chelating agent. The aqueous solution for undoped and doped YAlO3 phosphor were prepared using double distilled. The stoichiometric amounts of Y(NO3)3·4H2O was dissolved in distilled water (30 ml), then nitric acid was added into the solution with a 1:3 ratio of ions. Al(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in another beaker and then this solution was slowly added to the Y(NO3)3·4H2O + nitric acid solution mixture with continuous magnetic stirring at room temperature. The dopants were dissolved in 10 ml of ionized water and added to the prepared solution. At last, polyethylene glycol solution was added to the resultant mixture solution to get a better particle structure as a surfactant material. After stirring for 2 h, the solutions were heated at 90 °C for 8–12 h. In this period a clear gel was obtained with water evaporation and then the resultant transparent solutions were kept at 100 °C for about 24 h in an oven until homogeneously dried gels were formed. In order to remove the nitrate in them, the solutions were completely dried by increasing the heat by 10 °C from 90 °C to 200 °C in 40-min steps. Finally, Differential Thermal Analysis/Thermogravimeter Analyze (DTA/TGA) of the produced xerogel powders were performed in order to determine the heat treatment process of the synthesized materials.

Characterization methodology:
The crystal phase and composition of the prepared phosphors were systematically studied by recording the XRD patterns using a PANanalytical Empyrean X-ray diffraction (XRD) appliance operated at 45 kV tube voltage and 40 mA tube current. Cu-Kα (1.5405 Å) was used as the radiation source. The data were collected from 10° to 80° (2θ in steps of 0.01313o; 75.225 s per step; 0.0445°/s scan speed and 5331 number of steps.) Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG) were carried out using Exstar S11 TG/DTA 7300 instrument to study the thermal transformation of the synthesized phosphor. The samples were heated up to 1000 °C using a heating rate of 10 °C/min under inert atmosphere (Ar). The optical absorption properties of doped and undoped YAlO3 were studied by using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer operating from 800 to 200 nm. PL data of the prepared phosphors were collected at room temperature using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 spectrofluorometer equipped with a 488 nm xenon lamp (excitation spectra) and a xenon microsecond flash lamp (decay times). TL measurements were conducted with an RA94 Reader/Analyser system that was programmed to perform a linear heat from 50 °C to 400 °C with constant heating hate of 2 °C/s in N2 atmosphere. The morphology of the samples was characterized by the Nova NanoSEM 650 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). SEM images were taken by using the Gemini SEM500. SE (secondary electron) detector was selected for SEM images, and the working distance (WD) was set to about 8.1 mm. For doped phosphorus, images were taken at 20Kx magnifications.

Determination of kinetic parameters:
Calculation of kinetic parameters consisting of kinetic order (b), thermal activation energy (E), and frequency factor (s) of a thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) is very important for kinetic characterization of the material and production of more efficient dosimeters. In this work, the most widely used peak shape method [48] and computerized glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) [49] have been used to obtain the kinetic parameters by utilizing the TL glow curves of the synthesized pure and doped materials.

                        Peak shape method
                        This method is commonly used to determine thermal activation energy (E), frequency factor (s) and kinetic order (b) based on shape and geometrical parameters of the glow peak. These parameters are calculated using shape parameters:
                        ω = T2 – T1 (the total width at half the maximum intensity).
                        δ = T2 – Tm (half width on the falling side of the glow peak).
                        τ = Tm – T1 (half width on the rising side of the glow peak).
                        μ = δ/ω (symmetry factor).where T1, T2 and Tm refers to temperature at half the maximum intensity on the rising part of the peak, temperature at half the maximum intensity on the falling part of the peak, temperature at the maximum intensity, respectively. The kinetics of the peak are determined by the calculated μ symmetry factor; it equals 0.42 for first order kinetics and 0.52 for second order kinetics.
                        The activation energy (E) for any order of kinetics is [48].

                        Computerized glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) method
                        The main TL glow curve is composed of many overlapping glow peaks based on the factors such as ion impurities, atomic displacement or vacancy defects in the material. The CGCD method is a frequently used method to determine the number of glow peaks in the main TL curve and to estimate trap parameters activation energy (E), frequency factor (s) and kinetic order (b). For defining the best CGDC fitting, the figure of merit (FOM) [50,51] has been used and is given by

Peak shape method:
This method is commonly used to determine thermal activation energy (E), frequency factor (s) and kinetic order (b) based on shape and geometrical parameters of the glow peak. These parameters are calculated using shape parameters:
ω = T2 – T1 (the total width at half the maximum intensity).
δ = T2 – Tm (half width on the falling side of the glow peak).
τ = Tm – T1 (half width on the rising side of the glow peak).
μ = δ/ω (symmetry factor).where T1, T2 and Tm refers to temperature at half the maximum intensity on the rising part of the peak, temperature at half the maximum intensity on the falling part of the peak, temperature at the maximum intensity, respectively. The kinetics of the peak are determined by the calculated μ symmetry factor; it equals 0.42 for first order kinetics and 0.52 for second order kinetics.
The activation energy (E) for any order of kinetics is [48].

Computerized glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) method:
The main TL glow curve is composed of many overlapping glow peaks based on the factors such as ion impurities, atomic displacement or vacancy defects in the material. The CGCD method is a frequently used method to determine the number of glow peaks in the main TL curve and to estimate trap parameters activation energy (E), frequency factor (s) and kinetic order (b). For defining the best CGDC fitting, the figure of merit (FOM) [50,51] has been used and is given by

                     As can be seen Table 1
                        , the grain size of the undoped sample shrinked somewhat with the RE3+ addition. The sizes of grains are decreased by the addition of RE3+ and the boundaries of grains began to come out. The decrease of grain size can be described as the suppression of crystallite size due to the shrinkage of lattice symmetry.
                     The XRD peaks of the samples matches well with the single phase of YAlO3, orthorhombic distorted perovskite structure (a = 0.5303 nm, b = 0.7348 nm, c = 0.5169 nm,

                        ) [53]. No extra phase was detected, indicating that doping Mn2+, Tb3+ or Nd3+ does not change the structure of YAlO3. Taking into account the ionic radius of the dopants and host material cations, the dopants are probably proposed to occupy Y3+ and Al3+ sites in the YAlO3 host lattice without causing any change in the crystal structure.

                     DTA/TG analysis
                     The TGA and DTA have been performed on synthesized sample by the sol-gel method to understand the thermal decomposition and phase transition of the material during heating.
                     The thermal behaviors of the obtained phosphor have been examined during heat treatment by DTA/TG at the heating rate of 50 °C/min up to 1400 °C. Thermogravimetric curve is pointed blue in Fig. 2
                         consists of three mass losses regions with increasing temperature, and some exothermic and endothermic reaction peaks have been observed in the DTA curves. The first mass loss is 6.44% up to 250 °C. As mentioned before, the samples have been prepared by sol-gel method, this minor mass difference has possibly related with the removal absorbed water molecules by the YAlO3. DTA curve is also in agreement with the TGA curve, initial endothermic peak may indicate this phase changing. The second mass loss is from 250 to 550 °C and the lost weight which can be correspond to the combustion of the organic compounds is approximately 59.08%. The final observed mass loss (7.03%) is between 550 and 1400 °C and endothermic (at 1092 °C) and exothermic (at 1275 °C) reactions seen in DTA results may be ascribed to the crystallization of YAlO3.

                     Morphological properties of phosphors
                     The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis have been carried out to study the surface, morphology and grain size of the crystallites of prepared phosphors by sol-gel method. SEM micrographs and EDS graphs of YAlO3: Nd3+, YAlO3: Tb3+ and YAlO3:Mn2+/Nd3+ are shown in Fig. 3
                        (a), (b) and (c), respectively. As observed in the SEM images, clustered like structure has been distributed over all the grains, the particles show dumble in shape are agglomerated. Further, intense peaks proving the existence of host (Y, Al, O) and dopant (Mn, Nd, Tb) elements are seen in EDS spectra.

                        Photoluminescence (PL) properties
                        
                           Fig. 4
                           (a–h) shows, the emission and the excitation spectra of YAlO3, YAlO3: Mn2+, YAlO3: Nd3+ (VIS), YAlO3: Nd+3 (NIR), YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ (VIS), YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ (NIR), YAlO3: Tb3+ and YAlO3: Mn2+/Tb3+, respectively.
                        As can be seen from Fig. 4(a), the PL spectra of irradiated crystal exhibits two emission peaks at 514 nm and 610 nm for the excitation wavelength of 336 nm which shows the maximum emission. These peaks indicate the presence of the luminescent defects in the sample formed during the synthesis by heat treatment and create electron-hole traps that cause the pure material to gain luminescence characteristics. According to the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Mn2+ shown in Fig. 4(b), YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor shows a strong green emission at 526 nm. This emission is related to the transition 4T1(G)→6A1(S) of Mn2+ ions acting as an activating center. The disadvantage of the Mn2+ activator is that the d-d optical transitions are spin and parity forbidden. Therefore, for most host materials, the luminescence intensities of these ions are weak. Further, in TL results, the Mn2+ doped sample has a very low intensity. For emission intensity, the effective factors are the amount of dopant and the energy transfer from different ions which have high absorption coefficients [54]. Taking account this, Nd3+ and Tb3+ rare earth ions have been used as co-dopant to YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor. UV and NIR emission spectra of YAlO3: Nd3+ phosphor are shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). These spectra have been taken at excitation wavelength of 348 nm for detecting emission in the visible region and at 808 nm for NIR emission. In Fig. 4(c), the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Nd3+ phosphor, characteristic emissions originating from 4G11/2 → 4I9/2 (∼423 nm), 4G9/2 → 4I9/2 (∼460 nm) and 4G7/2 → 4I9/2 (∼540 nm) transitions have been observed. According to Fig. 4(d), there are three emission bands of Nd+3 ions in the NIR spectral region of the spectrum. These three bands can be attributed to transitions 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 (∼910 nm), 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 (∼1064 nm), 4F3/2 → 4I13/2 (∼1333 nm). Besides, two emission peaks have occurred instead of a single peak due to the cleavages at the 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 transition.
                        
                           Fig. 4(e) shows the VIS emission spectrum of YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ phosphor taken at excitation wavelength of 384 nm. Because the luminescence light emitted in the green spectral region is characteristic of Mn2+ ions and can be expressed as Mn2++hv→Mn3++e−. Energy transfer causes an increase in the intensity of the emission, but this expected increase could not be observed. In Fig. 4(f), Nd3+ is used as a co-dopant to YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor and the NIR emission spectrum of this material is shown. Three different luminescence peaks are observed at 910 nm, 1064 nm and 1333 nm, belonging to Nd3+ ions, in NIR emission spectrum of YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+. Although characteristic transition emissions of Nd3+ are seen in this spectrum, when compared to the spectrum observed in 4(d), it has exhibited a lower intensity. This may be explained based on nonradiative transitions, ion and O2− interactions, and energy transfer from the rare earth ions to the host material. Fig. 4(g) shows the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Tb3+ phosphor; four main peaks at 490 nm, 544 nm, 580 nm and 620 nm are associated with Tb3+ ions in YAlO3 host material. These are the 5D4→7F6 (∼490 nm), 5D4→7F5 (∼544 nm), 5D4→7F4 (∼580 nm), 5D4→7F3 (∼620 nm) transitions. The most important of these transitions is the sharpest and brightest green emission peak, which occurs at about 544 nm. Therefore, it can be said that Tb3+ doped YAlO3 phosphor has the potential to be used as a green luminescence material. In Fig. 4(h), the PL spectrum taken in the VIS region for YAlO3: Mn2+/Tb3+ phosphor is shown. As it is well known, Mn2+ exhibits a sharp peak at 550 nm due to the 4T1(G)→6A1(S) transition. By adding Tb3+ to the same material, an energy transfer has occurred from the host material to Mn2+, and from Mn2+ to Tb3+ centers, and the intensity of this peak has increased. Additionally, the emission peaks of 5D3
                           5G6→7Fj (j:6,5,4) and 5D4→7Fj (j:6,5,4,3), which are caused by the characteristic transitions of Tb3+ ions, are also observed in this spectrum.

As can be seen from the figure, the optical absorption spectrum of undoped YAlO3 has a broad absorption band, starting from ∼500 nm, including the UV region and shifting towards the maximum absorption at ∼240 nm. This peak at ∼240 nm is thought to arise from the characteristic electron transition between the valence and conduction band of the host crystal.
                        The energy band gap (Eg) is a key parameter to state the suitability of semiconductors for using in optoelectronic applications (lasers, solar cells, diodes, etc). The Tauc Plot method, most commonly met type method of calculating the optical band gap of semiconductors or amorphous samples, has been used for estimation of band gap. The Tauc equation is given by:

                            is the optical energy gap and n is a number associated with the type of electronic transitions. The typical Tauc graph has the energy of light on the x-axis and the expression (αhν)1/r on the y-axis. Here α is the absorption coefficient of the sample and r is the coefficient related to the nature of the transitions. It is chosen as r:1/2 for direct allowed transitions, r:3/2 for direct forbidden transitions, r:2 for indirect allowed transitions, and r: 3 for indirect forbidden transitions [55]. The optical band gap energy of 2.79 eV for the undoped sample has been observed in Fig. 6
                           . Depending on the presence of Nd3+ and Tb3+ dopant ions this value has decreased to the range 2.46–2.56 eV, while

                            value in Mn2+ doped sample is higher than undoped sample (Fig. 6). Further an intermediary energy level under 2 eV has been observed in the graph of the sample with Tb3+ doped. It can be said that the TL graphs have suggested this intermediate energy level due to having the best result among the other doped samples of the Tb3+ doped sample.
                        The absorption spectra shown in Fig. 5(b) have been obtained in the wavelength region of 200–800 nm for Mn2+/Nd3+, Mn2+/Tb3+ doped and undoped YAlO3. As can be seen from the figure, the absorption spectra of the co-doped samples have shifted towards the blue region. Also, the bandgap narrowing observed in graphs belong to Mn2+/Nd3+and Mn2+/Tb3+ doped sample can be explained by the Burstein-Moss bandgap narrowing phenomena; Ion doping can be defined as an increase in structural defects in the host lattice and it reduces the energy band gap by the presence of intermediary energy levels in the band gap. The bandgap narrowing can be attributed to the strong s-d and p-d spin-exchange interactions between the band electrons and localized d electrons of the trivalent ions [56]. The band gap widening observed in some samples is related to the movement of Fermi level into the conduction band with increasing doping concentration. Only optical transitions containing photons with energies higher than the band gap of the undoped semiconductor are allowed. This resultant band gap is equal to sum of actual band gap plus Burstein-Moss shift [57,58].

The decrease in the color purity value is associated with the increase in the white light purity value [61]. The color purity of BaTa2O6:Mn2+ phosphor is 33.16%, which means being fairly close to white light. The color purities of the phosphors are given in Table X. Further, to examine the quality of white light, the color correlated temperature (CCT) values were calculated by McCamy Eq. (8) [61]:

                        Thermoluminescence (TL) properties and analysis of TL glow curves by calculating of kinetic parameters
                        The TL glow curves of synthesized phosphor have been obtained using RA'95 Reader-Analyser Thermoluminescence System with a constant heating rate of 6 °C/s in the temperature range of 50–400 °C. The studied samples have been radiated using a UV light (254 nm) for 7 min. According to the results, it is seen that the glow curve of undoped YAlO3 has higher intensity. However, the TL intensity of doped YAlO3 samples has decreased remarkably due to the defects based on the ions in the crystal structure. It is known that the suitability of a material for dosimetric applications is related to the existence of deep traps at high temperatures, narrow full width half maximum (FWHM), increasing sensitivity with increasing absorbed energy and being reusable (the repeated use of a substance in heating and irradiation) [62,63]. As can be seen in Fig. 8
                           , the peaks indicating the existence of the deep traps have identified in some of the synthesized phosphors at high temperatures.
                        It can be seen from presented results in Fig. 8(a) that there are two prominent TL peaks at 140 °C and 310 °C of undoped YAlO3 phosphor. The peak at 310 °C draws attention because it has the highest intensity at high temperature. This high temperature peak shows the presence of trapped electrons in deeper traps.
                        The main TL glow curve of each sample is composed of many overlapping glow peaks based on the factors such as ion impurities, atomic displacement or vacancy defects in the material. The CGCD method is a frequently used method to determine the peaks under this main TL curve with different activation energies by various TL resolution programs. The deconvolution of TL curve of Fig. 7(a) is shown in Fig. 8(b). Given in Table 3
                            the activation energy and frequency factor values of the resolved peaks under the main TL glow curves have been obtained by the analysis program. As to Table 4
                           , each peak is calculated with the Chen Method, also known as Peak Shape, and the kinetic order (μ), average activation energy (Eave)and frequency factor (s) values of the peaks have been calculated. As a result, when the values calculated by both methods are compared, it is seen that the results are compatible.
                        A single main peak around 200 °C is observed in the TL glow curve of YAlO3: Tb+3 phosphor in Fig. 9
                           (a). Based on the experimental observation, the doping of Tb+3 ion has increased the TL glow curve intensity, this behavior is a consequence of the high electron trapping ability of the defects formed by doping of the Tb+3 ion in the aluminate-based crystal lattice. It is important to note that by doping of Tb+3 ion it might be possible to improve the TL glow curve intensity. Tables 5 and 6
                           
                            show calculated kinetic parameters by CGDC and Chen's peak shape method, respectively.
                        
                           Fig. 10
                            exhibits TL characteristic of the studied YAlO3: Nd3+ sample within 150–350 °C. The sample has showed maximum intensity value of TL glow curve at around 220 °C. Further, dopping Nd3+ has affected the intensity after 375 °C and a weak peak has been observed. It is thought that Nd3+ ions, which act as a luminescence center in the host crystal, cause a decrease in luminescence intensity by filling the existing atomic spaces. In order to understand the TL kinetic of YAlO3 crystal, the TL glow curve parameters (activation energy, frequency factor and kinetic order) have calculated using CGDC (Table 7
                           ) and peak shape method (Table 8
                           ).
                        As can be seen from the YAlO3: Mn2+ TL curve (Fig. 11
                           ), the intensity in TL curves of the YAlO3 host material has decreased by the dopping of Mn2+ ions and has not exhibited a distinct glow curve. Therefore, kinetic parameter calculation has not applied for YAlO3: Mn+2.
                        The Tb3+ ion has been used as the co-dopant in YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor and observed a significant increase of intensity when compared to the TL curve of YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor (Fig. 12
                           ). Besides, the peak obtained at about 200 °C is thought to be a characteristic peak of Tb3+ in the host material. The lattice parameters calculated using CGDC and peak shape method have been reported in Tables 9 and 10
                           
                           , respectively.
                        In order to give the calculation values of the 6th peak among the analyzed peaks with the peak shape method (Table 10), it is necessary to obtain the T2 temperature value determined over the FWHM. However, it is not possible to calculate this value at a temperature exceeding 400 °C.
                        As seen in Fig. 13
                           , YAlO3: Mn+2/Nd+3 TL glow curve detected in the temperature range of 50–400 °C, there are TL peaks at temperatures exceeding 180 °C and 400 °C due to the presence of trapped electrons in deeper traps. The peak at high temperature has not been considered as TL peak because it may be related to black body radiation although this is generally encountered in the absence of nitrogen used as an inert gas during the measurement. Therefore, the measurements have repeated in nitrogen environment and the same results have been obtained. It is well known that heating rate is an efficient parameter altering the shape and peak position of the glow curve, so the heating rate may has an effect on the glow curve. The numerical solution to the CGDC and peak shape analysis of glow curve for YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ is given in Tables 11 and 12
                           
                           , respectively.

As can be seen Table 1
                        , the grain size of the undoped sample shrinked somewhat with the RE3+ addition. The sizes of grains are decreased by the addition of RE3+ and the boundaries of grains began to come out. The decrease of grain size can be described as the suppression of crystallite size due to the shrinkage of lattice symmetry.
The XRD peaks of the samples matches well with the single phase of YAlO3, orthorhombic distorted perovskite structure (a = 0.5303 nm, b = 0.7348 nm, c = 0.5169 nm,

                        ) [53]. No extra phase was detected, indicating that doping Mn2+, Tb3+ or Nd3+ does not change the structure of YAlO3. Taking into account the ionic radius of the dopants and host material cations, the dopants are probably proposed to occupy Y3+ and Al3+ sites in the YAlO3 host lattice without causing any change in the crystal structure.

DTA/TG analysis:
The TGA and DTA have been performed on synthesized sample by the sol-gel method to understand the thermal decomposition and phase transition of the material during heating.
The thermal behaviors of the obtained phosphor have been examined during heat treatment by DTA/TG at the heating rate of 50 °C/min up to 1400 °C. Thermogravimetric curve is pointed blue in Fig. 2
                         consists of three mass losses regions with increasing temperature, and some exothermic and endothermic reaction peaks have been observed in the DTA curves. The first mass loss is 6.44% up to 250 °C. As mentioned before, the samples have been prepared by sol-gel method, this minor mass difference has possibly related with the removal absorbed water molecules by the YAlO3. DTA curve is also in agreement with the TGA curve, initial endothermic peak may indicate this phase changing. The second mass loss is from 250 to 550 °C and the lost weight which can be correspond to the combustion of the organic compounds is approximately 59.08%. The final observed mass loss (7.03%) is between 550 and 1400 °C and endothermic (at 1092 °C) and exothermic (at 1275 °C) reactions seen in DTA results may be ascribed to the crystallization of YAlO3.

Morphological properties of phosphors:
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis have been carried out to study the surface, morphology and grain size of the crystallites of prepared phosphors by sol-gel method. SEM micrographs and EDS graphs of YAlO3: Nd3+, YAlO3: Tb3+ and YAlO3:Mn2+/Nd3+ are shown in Fig. 3
                        (a), (b) and (c), respectively. As observed in the SEM images, clustered like structure has been distributed over all the grains, the particles show dumble in shape are agglomerated. Further, intense peaks proving the existence of host (Y, Al, O) and dopant (Mn, Nd, Tb) elements are seen in EDS spectra.

3.4.1
                        Photoluminescence (PL) properties
                        
                           Fig. 4
                           (a–h) shows, the emission and the excitation spectra of YAlO3, YAlO3: Mn2+, YAlO3: Nd3+ (VIS), YAlO3: Nd+3 (NIR), YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ (VIS), YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ (NIR), YAlO3: Tb3+ and YAlO3: Mn2+/Tb3+, respectively.
                        As can be seen from Fig. 4(a), the PL spectra of irradiated crystal exhibits two emission peaks at 514 nm and 610 nm for the excitation wavelength of 336 nm which shows the maximum emission. These peaks indicate the presence of the luminescent defects in the sample formed during the synthesis by heat treatment and create electron-hole traps that cause the pure material to gain luminescence characteristics. According to the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Mn2+ shown in Fig. 4(b), YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor shows a strong green emission at 526 nm. This emission is related to the transition 4T1(G)→6A1(S) of Mn2+ ions acting as an activating center. The disadvantage of the Mn2+ activator is that the d-d optical transitions are spin and parity forbidden. Therefore, for most host materials, the luminescence intensities of these ions are weak. Further, in TL results, the Mn2+ doped sample has a very low intensity. For emission intensity, the effective factors are the amount of dopant and the energy transfer from different ions which have high absorption coefficients [54]. Taking account this, Nd3+ and Tb3+ rare earth ions have been used as co-dopant to YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor. UV and NIR emission spectra of YAlO3: Nd3+ phosphor are shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). These spectra have been taken at excitation wavelength of 348 nm for detecting emission in the visible region and at 808 nm for NIR emission. In Fig. 4(c), the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Nd3+ phosphor, characteristic emissions originating from 4G11/2 → 4I9/2 (∼423 nm), 4G9/2 → 4I9/2 (∼460 nm) and 4G7/2 → 4I9/2 (∼540 nm) transitions have been observed. According to Fig. 4(d), there are three emission bands of Nd+3 ions in the NIR spectral region of the spectrum. These three bands can be attributed to transitions 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 (∼910 nm), 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 (∼1064 nm), 4F3/2 → 4I13/2 (∼1333 nm). Besides, two emission peaks have occurred instead of a single peak due to the cleavages at the 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 transition.
                        
                           Fig. 4(e) shows the VIS emission spectrum of YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ phosphor taken at excitation wavelength of 384 nm. Because the luminescence light emitted in the green spectral region is characteristic of Mn2+ ions and can be expressed as Mn2++hv→Mn3++e−. Energy transfer causes an increase in the intensity of the emission, but this expected increase could not be observed. In Fig. 4(f), Nd3+ is used as a co-dopant to YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor and the NIR emission spectrum of this material is shown. Three different luminescence peaks are observed at 910 nm, 1064 nm and 1333 nm, belonging to Nd3+ ions, in NIR emission spectrum of YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+. Although characteristic transition emissions of Nd3+ are seen in this spectrum, when compared to the spectrum observed in 4(d), it has exhibited a lower intensity. This may be explained based on nonradiative transitions, ion and O2− interactions, and energy transfer from the rare earth ions to the host material. Fig. 4(g) shows the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Tb3+ phosphor; four main peaks at 490 nm, 544 nm, 580 nm and 620 nm are associated with Tb3+ ions in YAlO3 host material. These are the 5D4→7F6 (∼490 nm), 5D4→7F5 (∼544 nm), 5D4→7F4 (∼580 nm), 5D4→7F3 (∼620 nm) transitions. The most important of these transitions is the sharpest and brightest green emission peak, which occurs at about 544 nm. Therefore, it can be said that Tb3+ doped YAlO3 phosphor has the potential to be used as a green luminescence material. In Fig. 4(h), the PL spectrum taken in the VIS region for YAlO3: Mn2+/Tb3+ phosphor is shown. As it is well known, Mn2+ exhibits a sharp peak at 550 nm due to the 4T1(G)→6A1(S) transition. By adding Tb3+ to the same material, an energy transfer has occurred from the host material to Mn2+, and from Mn2+ to Tb3+ centers, and the intensity of this peak has increased. Additionally, the emission peaks of 5D3
                           5G6→7Fj (j:6,5,4) and 5D4→7Fj (j:6,5,4,3), which are caused by the characteristic transitions of Tb3+ ions, are also observed in this spectrum.
3.4.2
                        Optical absorption properties
                        The absorption spectra shown in Fig. 5
                           (a) have been acquired in the wavelength region of 200–800 nm for Mn2+, Nd3+ and Tb3+ doped and undoped YAlO3. As can be seen from the figure, the optical absorption spectrum of undoped YAlO3 has a broad absorption band, starting from ∼500 nm, including the UV region and shifting towards the maximum absorption at ∼240 nm. This peak at ∼240 nm is thought to arise from the characteristic electron transition between the valence and conduction band of the host crystal.
                        The energy band gap (Eg) is a key parameter to state the suitability of semiconductors for using in optoelectronic applications (lasers, solar cells, diodes, etc). The Tauc Plot method, most commonly met type method of calculating the optical band gap of semiconductors or amorphous samples, has been used for estimation of band gap. The Tauc equation is given by:

                            is the optical energy gap and n is a number associated with the type of electronic transitions. The typical Tauc graph has the energy of light on the x-axis and the expression (αhν)1/r on the y-axis. Here α is the absorption coefficient of the sample and r is the coefficient related to the nature of the transitions. It is chosen as r:1/2 for direct allowed transitions, r:3/2 for direct forbidden transitions, r:2 for indirect allowed transitions, and r: 3 for indirect forbidden transitions [55]. The optical band gap energy of 2.79 eV for the undoped sample has been observed in Fig. 6
                           . Depending on the presence of Nd3+ and Tb3+ dopant ions this value has decreased to the range 2.46–2.56 eV, while

                            value in Mn2+ doped sample is higher than undoped sample (Fig. 6). Further an intermediary energy level under 2 eV has been observed in the graph of the sample with Tb3+ doped. It can be said that the TL graphs have suggested this intermediate energy level due to having the best result among the other doped samples of the Tb3+ doped sample.
                        The absorption spectra shown in Fig. 5(b) have been obtained in the wavelength region of 200–800 nm for Mn2+/Nd3+, Mn2+/Tb3+ doped and undoped YAlO3. As can be seen from the figure, the absorption spectra of the co-doped samples have shifted towards the blue region. Also, the bandgap narrowing observed in graphs belong to Mn2+/Nd3+and Mn2+/Tb3+ doped sample can be explained by the Burstein-Moss bandgap narrowing phenomena; Ion doping can be defined as an increase in structural defects in the host lattice and it reduces the energy band gap by the presence of intermediary energy levels in the band gap. The bandgap narrowing can be attributed to the strong s-d and p-d spin-exchange interactions between the band electrons and localized d electrons of the trivalent ions [56]. The band gap widening observed in some samples is related to the movement of Fermi level into the conduction band with increasing doping concentration. Only optical transitions containing photons with energies higher than the band gap of the undoped semiconductor are allowed. This resultant band gap is equal to sum of actual band gap plus Burstein-Moss shift [57,58].

The decrease in the color purity value is associated with the increase in the white light purity value [61]. The color purity of BaTa2O6:Mn2+ phosphor is 33.16%, which means being fairly close to white light. The color purities of the phosphors are given in Table X. Further, to examine the quality of white light, the color correlated temperature (CCT) values were calculated by McCamy Eq. (8) [61]:

The CCT values of rare earth (Tb, Nd) doped and transition metal (Mn) doped/co-doped YAlO3 were found in the range of 2126.98, 4216.56, 6964.48, 5772.09, 7789.58, 6624.19 respectively. The CIE parameters of all the phosphors are tabulated in Table 2.

                        Thermoluminescence (TL) properties and analysis of TL glow curves by calculating of kinetic parameters
                        The TL glow curves of synthesized phosphor have been obtained using RA'95 Reader-Analyser Thermoluminescence System with a constant heating rate of 6 °C/s in the temperature range of 50–400 °C. The studied samples have been radiated using a UV light (254 nm) for 7 min. According to the results, it is seen that the glow curve of undoped YAlO3 has higher intensity. However, the TL intensity of doped YAlO3 samples has decreased remarkably due to the defects based on the ions in the crystal structure. It is known that the suitability of a material for dosimetric applications is related to the existence of deep traps at high temperatures, narrow full width half maximum (FWHM), increasing sensitivity with increasing absorbed energy and being reusable (the repeated use of a substance in heating and irradiation) [62,63]. As can be seen in Fig. 8
                           , the peaks indicating the existence of the deep traps have identified in some of the synthesized phosphors at high temperatures.
                        It can be seen from presented results in Fig. 8(a) that there are two prominent TL peaks at 140 °C and 310 °C of undoped YAlO3 phosphor. The peak at 310 °C draws attention because it has the highest intensity at high temperature. This high temperature peak shows the presence of trapped electrons in deeper traps.
                        The main TL glow curve of each sample is composed of many overlapping glow peaks based on the factors such as ion impurities, atomic displacement or vacancy defects in the material. The CGCD method is a frequently used method to determine the peaks under this main TL curve with different activation energies by various TL resolution programs. The deconvolution of TL curve of Fig. 7(a) is shown in Fig. 8(b). Given in Table 3
                            the activation energy and frequency factor values of the resolved peaks under the main TL glow curves have been obtained by the analysis program. As to Table 4
                           , each peak is calculated with the Chen Method, also known as Peak Shape, and the kinetic order (μ), average activation energy (Eave)and frequency factor (s) values of the peaks have been calculated. As a result, when the values calculated by both methods are compared, it is seen that the results are compatible.
                        A single main peak around 200 °C is observed in the TL glow curve of YAlO3: Tb+3 phosphor in Fig. 9
                           (a). Based on the experimental observation, the doping of Tb+3 ion has increased the TL glow curve intensity, this behavior is a consequence of the high electron trapping ability of the defects formed by doping of the Tb+3 ion in the aluminate-based crystal lattice. It is important to note that by doping of Tb+3 ion it might be possible to improve the TL glow curve intensity. Tables 5 and 6
                           
                            show calculated kinetic parameters by CGDC and Chen's peak shape method, respectively.
                        
                           Fig. 10
                            exhibits TL characteristic of the studied YAlO3: Nd3+ sample within 150–350 °C. The sample has showed maximum intensity value of TL glow curve at around 220 °C. Further, dopping Nd3+ has affected the intensity after 375 °C and a weak peak has been observed. It is thought that Nd3+ ions, which act as a luminescence center in the host crystal, cause a decrease in luminescence intensity by filling the existing atomic spaces. In order to understand the TL kinetic of YAlO3 crystal, the TL glow curve parameters (activation energy, frequency factor and kinetic order) have calculated using CGDC (Table 7
                           ) and peak shape method (Table 8
                           ).
                        As can be seen from the YAlO3: Mn2+ TL curve (Fig. 11
                           ), the intensity in TL curves of the YAlO3 host material has decreased by the dopping of Mn2+ ions and has not exhibited a distinct glow curve. Therefore, kinetic parameter calculation has not applied for YAlO3: Mn+2.
                        The Tb3+ ion has been used as the co-dopant in YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor and observed a significant increase of intensity when compared to the TL curve of YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor (Fig. 12
                           ). Besides, the peak obtained at about 200 °C is thought to be a characteristic peak of Tb3+ in the host material. The lattice parameters calculated using CGDC and peak shape method have been reported in Tables 9 and 10
                           
                           , respectively.
                        In order to give the calculation values of the 6th peak among the analyzed peaks with the peak shape method (Table 10), it is necessary to obtain the T2 temperature value determined over the FWHM. However, it is not possible to calculate this value at a temperature exceeding 400 °C.
                        As seen in Fig. 13
                           , YAlO3: Mn+2/Nd+3 TL glow curve detected in the temperature range of 50–400 °C, there are TL peaks at temperatures exceeding 180 °C and 400 °C due to the presence of trapped electrons in deeper traps. The peak at high temperature has not been considered as TL peak because it may be related to black body radiation although this is generally encountered in the absence of nitrogen used as an inert gas during the measurement. Therefore, the measurements have repeated in nitrogen environment and the same results have been obtained. It is well known that heating rate is an efficient parameter altering the shape and peak position of the glow curve, so the heating rate may has an effect on the glow curve. The numerical solution to the CGDC and peak shape analysis of glow curve for YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ is given in Tables 11 and 12
                           
                           , respectively.

Photoluminescence (PL) properties:
Fig. 4
                           (a–h) shows, the emission and the excitation spectra of YAlO3, YAlO3: Mn2+, YAlO3: Nd3+ (VIS), YAlO3: Nd+3 (NIR), YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ (VIS), YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ (NIR), YAlO3: Tb3+ and YAlO3: Mn2+/Tb3+, respectively.
As can be seen from Fig. 4(a), the PL spectra of irradiated crystal exhibits two emission peaks at 514 nm and 610 nm for the excitation wavelength of 336 nm which shows the maximum emission. These peaks indicate the presence of the luminescent defects in the sample formed during the synthesis by heat treatment and create electron-hole traps that cause the pure material to gain luminescence characteristics. According to the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Mn2+ shown in Fig. 4(b), YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor shows a strong green emission at 526 nm. This emission is related to the transition 4T1(G)→6A1(S) of Mn2+ ions acting as an activating center. The disadvantage of the Mn2+ activator is that the d-d optical transitions are spin and parity forbidden. Therefore, for most host materials, the luminescence intensities of these ions are weak. Further, in TL results, the Mn2+ doped sample has a very low intensity. For emission intensity, the effective factors are the amount of dopant and the energy transfer from different ions which have high absorption coefficients [54]. Taking account this, Nd3+ and Tb3+ rare earth ions have been used as co-dopant to YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor. UV and NIR emission spectra of YAlO3: Nd3+ phosphor are shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). These spectra have been taken at excitation wavelength of 348 nm for detecting emission in the visible region and at 808 nm for NIR emission. In Fig. 4(c), the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Nd3+ phosphor, characteristic emissions originating from 4G11/2 → 4I9/2 (∼423 nm), 4G9/2 → 4I9/2 (∼460 nm) and 4G7/2 → 4I9/2 (∼540 nm) transitions have been observed. According to Fig. 4(d), there are three emission bands of Nd+3 ions in the NIR spectral region of the spectrum. These three bands can be attributed to transitions 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 (∼910 nm), 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 (∼1064 nm), 4F3/2 → 4I13/2 (∼1333 nm). Besides, two emission peaks have occurred instead of a single peak due to the cleavages at the 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 transition.
Fig. 4(e) shows the VIS emission spectrum of YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ phosphor taken at excitation wavelength of 384 nm. Because the luminescence light emitted in the green spectral region is characteristic of Mn2+ ions and can be expressed as Mn2++hv→Mn3++e−. Energy transfer causes an increase in the intensity of the emission, but this expected increase could not be observed. In Fig. 4(f), Nd3+ is used as a co-dopant to YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor and the NIR emission spectrum of this material is shown. Three different luminescence peaks are observed at 910 nm, 1064 nm and 1333 nm, belonging to Nd3+ ions, in NIR emission spectrum of YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+. Although characteristic transition emissions of Nd3+ are seen in this spectrum, when compared to the spectrum observed in 4(d), it has exhibited a lower intensity. This may be explained based on nonradiative transitions, ion and O2− interactions, and energy transfer from the rare earth ions to the host material. Fig. 4(g) shows the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Tb3+ phosphor; four main peaks at 490 nm, 544 nm, 580 nm and 620 nm are associated with Tb3+ ions in YAlO3 host material. These are the 5D4→7F6 (∼490 nm), 5D4→7F5 (∼544 nm), 5D4→7F4 (∼580 nm), 5D4→7F3 (∼620 nm) transitions. The most important of these transitions is the sharpest and brightest green emission peak, which occurs at about 544 nm. Therefore, it can be said that Tb3+ doped YAlO3 phosphor has the potential to be used as a green luminescence material. In Fig. 4(h), the PL spectrum taken in the VIS region for YAlO3: Mn2+/Tb3+ phosphor is shown. As it is well known, Mn2+ exhibits a sharp peak at 550 nm due to the 4T1(G)→6A1(S) transition. By adding Tb3+ to the same material, an energy transfer has occurred from the host material to Mn2+, and from Mn2+ to Tb3+ centers, and the intensity of this peak has increased. Additionally, the emission peaks of 5D3
                           5G6→7Fj (j:6,5,4) and 5D4→7Fj (j:6,5,4,3), which are caused by the characteristic transitions of Tb3+ ions, are also observed in this spectrum.

Optical absorption properties:
The absorption spectra shown in Fig. 5
                           (a) have been acquired in the wavelength region of 200–800 nm for Mn2+, Nd3+ and Tb3+ doped and undoped YAlO3. As can be seen from the figure, the optical absorption spectrum of undoped YAlO3 has a broad absorption band, starting from ∼500 nm, including the UV region and shifting towards the maximum absorption at ∼240 nm. This peak at ∼240 nm is thought to arise from the characteristic electron transition between the valence and conduction band of the host crystal.
The energy band gap (Eg) is a key parameter to state the suitability of semiconductors for using in optoelectronic applications (lasers, solar cells, diodes, etc). The Tauc Plot method, most commonly met type method of calculating the optical band gap of semiconductors or amorphous samples, has been used for estimation of band gap. The Tauc equation is given by:

                            is the optical energy gap and n is a number associated with the type of electronic transitions. The typical Tauc graph has the energy of light on the x-axis and the expression (αhν)1/r on the y-axis. Here α is the absorption coefficient of the sample and r is the coefficient related to the nature of the transitions. It is chosen as r:1/2 for direct allowed transitions, r:3/2 for direct forbidden transitions, r:2 for indirect allowed transitions, and r: 3 for indirect forbidden transitions [55]. The optical band gap energy of 2.79 eV for the undoped sample has been observed in Fig. 6
                           . Depending on the presence of Nd3+ and Tb3+ dopant ions this value has decreased to the range 2.46–2.56 eV, while

                            value in Mn2+ doped sample is higher than undoped sample (Fig. 6). Further an intermediary energy level under 2 eV has been observed in the graph of the sample with Tb3+ doped. It can be said that the TL graphs have suggested this intermediate energy level due to having the best result among the other doped samples of the Tb3+ doped sample.
The absorption spectra shown in Fig. 5(b) have been obtained in the wavelength region of 200–800 nm for Mn2+/Nd3+, Mn2+/Tb3+ doped and undoped YAlO3. As can be seen from the figure, the absorption spectra of the co-doped samples have shifted towards the blue region. Also, the bandgap narrowing observed in graphs belong to Mn2+/Nd3+and Mn2+/Tb3+ doped sample can be explained by the Burstein-Moss bandgap narrowing phenomena; Ion doping can be defined as an increase in structural defects in the host lattice and it reduces the energy band gap by the presence of intermediary energy levels in the band gap. The bandgap narrowing can be attributed to the strong s-d and p-d spin-exchange interactions between the band electrons and localized d electrons of the trivalent ions [56]. The band gap widening observed in some samples is related to the movement of Fermi level into the conduction band with increasing doping concentration. Only optical transitions containing photons with energies higher than the band gap of the undoped semiconductor are allowed. This resultant band gap is equal to sum of actual band gap plus Burstein-Moss shift [57,58].

                           . Based on the PL, the CIE parameters (CIE coordinates, color purity, and color correlated temperature values) of all the phosphors were obtained in the study. The color purity of a phosphor can be evaluated by Eq. (7) [59,60]:

The decrease in the color purity value is associated with the increase in the white light purity value [61]. The color purity of BaTa2O6:Mn2+ phosphor is 33.16%, which means being fairly close to white light. The color purities of the phosphors are given in Table X. Further, to examine the quality of white light, the color correlated temperature (CCT) values were calculated by McCamy Eq. (8) [61]:

The CCT values of rare earth (Tb, Nd) doped and transition metal (Mn) doped/co-doped YAlO3 were found in the range of 2126.98, 4216.56, 6964.48, 5772.09, 7789.58, 6624.19 respectively. The CIE parameters of all the phosphors are tabulated in Table 2.

Thermoluminescence (TL) properties and analysis of TL glow curves by calculating of kinetic parameters:
The TL glow curves of synthesized phosphor have been obtained using RA'95 Reader-Analyser Thermoluminescence System with a constant heating rate of 6 °C/s in the temperature range of 50–400 °C. The studied samples have been radiated using a UV light (254 nm) for 7 min. According to the results, it is seen that the glow curve of undoped YAlO3 has higher intensity. However, the TL intensity of doped YAlO3 samples has decreased remarkably due to the defects based on the ions in the crystal structure. It is known that the suitability of a material for dosimetric applications is related to the existence of deep traps at high temperatures, narrow full width half maximum (FWHM), increasing sensitivity with increasing absorbed energy and being reusable (the repeated use of a substance in heating and irradiation) [62,63]. As can be seen in Fig. 8
                           , the peaks indicating the existence of the deep traps have identified in some of the synthesized phosphors at high temperatures.
It can be seen from presented results in Fig. 8(a) that there are two prominent TL peaks at 140 °C and 310 °C of undoped YAlO3 phosphor. The peak at 310 °C draws attention because it has the highest intensity at high temperature. This high temperature peak shows the presence of trapped electrons in deeper traps.
The main TL glow curve of each sample is composed of many overlapping glow peaks based on the factors such as ion impurities, atomic displacement or vacancy defects in the material. The CGCD method is a frequently used method to determine the peaks under this main TL curve with different activation energies by various TL resolution programs. The deconvolution of TL curve of Fig. 7(a) is shown in Fig. 8(b). Given in Table 3
                            the activation energy and frequency factor values of the resolved peaks under the main TL glow curves have been obtained by the analysis program. As to Table 4
                           , each peak is calculated with the Chen Method, also known as Peak Shape, and the kinetic order (μ), average activation energy (Eave)and frequency factor (s) values of the peaks have been calculated. As a result, when the values calculated by both methods are compared, it is seen that the results are compatible.
A single main peak around 200 °C is observed in the TL glow curve of YAlO3: Tb+3 phosphor in Fig. 9
                           (a). Based on the experimental observation, the doping of Tb+3 ion has increased the TL glow curve intensity, this behavior is a consequence of the high electron trapping ability of the defects formed by doping of the Tb+3 ion in the aluminate-based crystal lattice. It is important to note that by doping of Tb+3 ion it might be possible to improve the TL glow curve intensity. Tables 5 and 6
                           
                            show calculated kinetic parameters by CGDC and Chen's peak shape method, respectively.
Fig. 10
                            exhibits TL characteristic of the studied YAlO3: Nd3+ sample within 150–350 °C. The sample has showed maximum intensity value of TL glow curve at around 220 °C. Further, dopping Nd3+ has affected the intensity after 375 °C and a weak peak has been observed. It is thought that Nd3+ ions, which act as a luminescence center in the host crystal, cause a decrease in luminescence intensity by filling the existing atomic spaces. In order to understand the TL kinetic of YAlO3 crystal, the TL glow curve parameters (activation energy, frequency factor and kinetic order) have calculated using CGDC (Table 7
                           ) and peak shape method (Table 8
                           ).
As can be seen from the YAlO3: Mn2+ TL curve (Fig. 11
                           ), the intensity in TL curves of the YAlO3 host material has decreased by the dopping of Mn2+ ions and has not exhibited a distinct glow curve. Therefore, kinetic parameter calculation has not applied for YAlO3: Mn+2.
The Tb3+ ion has been used as the co-dopant in YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor and observed a significant increase of intensity when compared to the TL curve of YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor (Fig. 12
                           ). Besides, the peak obtained at about 200 °C is thought to be a characteristic peak of Tb3+ in the host material. The lattice parameters calculated using CGDC and peak shape method have been reported in Tables 9 and 10
                           
                           , respectively.
In order to give the calculation values of the 6th peak among the analyzed peaks with the peak shape method (Table 10), it is necessary to obtain the T2 temperature value determined over the FWHM. However, it is not possible to calculate this value at a temperature exceeding 400 °C.
As seen in Fig. 13
                           , YAlO3: Mn+2/Nd+3 TL glow curve detected in the temperature range of 50–400 °C, there are TL peaks at temperatures exceeding 180 °C and 400 °C due to the presence of trapped electrons in deeper traps. The peak at high temperature has not been considered as TL peak because it may be related to black body radiation although this is generally encountered in the absence of nitrogen used as an inert gas during the measurement. Therefore, the measurements have repeated in nitrogen environment and the same results have been obtained. It is well known that heating rate is an efficient parameter altering the shape and peak position of the glow curve, so the heating rate may has an effect on the glow curve. The numerical solution to the CGDC and peak shape analysis of glow curve for YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ is given in Tables 11 and 12
                           
                           , respectively.

Conclusions:
Tb3+, Nd3+ rare earth ions and Mn2+ transition metal ion doped and co-doped YAP phosphor were synthesized through nitrate-based sol-gel method, characterized by SEM, XRD, optical absorption and luminescence (PL, TL) measurements. Further, the kinetic parameters of the synthesized pure and doped materials were calculated using Computerized Glow Curve Deconvolution (CGCD) and Peak Shape Method for a better understanding of the optical properties that change with the doping process. In the PL spectrum 4G11/2 → 4I9/2, 4G9/2 → 4I9/2, 4G7/2 → 4I9/2, 5D4→7F6, 5D4→7F5, 5D4→7F4 and 5D4→7F3 transitions were observed. Additionally, 5D3
                     5G6→7Fj (j:6,5,4) and 5D4→7Fj (j:6,5,4,3) transitions of YAP: Tb3+ were obtained. The optical band gap of undoped sample was calculated as 2.79 eV. Depending on the presence of Nd3+ and Tb3+ dopant ions this value was decreased to the range 2.46–2.56 eV, while

                      value in Mn2+ doped sample was higher than undoped sample. Further an intermediary energy level under 2 eV has been observed in the graph of the sample with Tb3+ doped. With the adding of dopant ions TL peaks were obtained at high temperatures. Based on the experimental results, the doping of Tb+3 ion increased the TL glow curve intensity. It is important to note that by doping of Tb+3 ion it might be possible to improve the TL glow curve intensity.

In the recent years there has been an increasing interest in designing and developing of new efficient luminescent materials consist of the host and doped ion. The choice of the host lattice and suitable emitting ions plays an important role to achieve a qualified phosphor which has high application potential in the field of LED-lighting, luminescent devices and plasma display panels (PDPS).

Among many hosts, RAlO3 (R = Gd, Tb, Lu or Y) perovskites have emerged as a excellent host that can be used as an extensive luminescent material in lighting and micro imaging [1]. The Al2O3–Y2O3 binary system has been used as starting materials due to their thermal conductivity and high temperature resistance, etc. [2,3]. In the yttria (Y2O3) - alumina (Al2O3) phase diagram, there are four different crystalline phases: YAP (Yttrium Aluminum Perovskite: YAlO3) with orthorhombic perovskite structure, YAH (Yttrium Aluminum Hexagonal: YAlO3) with metastable hexagonal structure, YAG (Yttrium Aluminum Garnet: Y3Al5O12) with cubic garnet structure and YAM (Yttrium Aluminium Monoclinic: Y4Al2O9) with monoclinic structure. Among these, YAlO3 (yttrium orthoaluminate perovskite), with good mechanical and thermal properties, natural birefringence and anisotropy, is well-suited material for being used as host for lasers, fast scintillators and phosphors [4,5].

The dopant ion converts the absorbed energy to the light, while the host absorb the target radiation. Furthermore, the response efficiency to the light increases due to the addition of co-activator with the dopant for enhancing the trap concentration [6]. Doping of rare earth ion helps in improving the efficiency of phosphor resulted from a partially filled 4fn (1 < n < 14) shell of the ion. Because it is known that 4f electrons are well shielded by 5s2 and 5p6 orbitals; depending on the 4f–4f inner-shell transitions rare earth elements have been widely used as dopant in phosphors to optimize the properties (high luminescence yield, narrow emission line, and long decay time constant) [7–9]. Recently, it has been observed that there has been an increase in studies on phosphor materials doped with rare earth ions due to their wide application areas (solid-state lighting, photovoltaic systems, solar cells, display, luminescent materials, catalysts, laser materials, radiation dosimeters etc.) [10,11]. Up on going through the literature, it has become obvious that YAP crystals are frequently doped with transition metal and rare-earth elements [1,4,12–15]. Presence of two trivalent cations is leading to doping like this; transition metal and rare earth ions are doped at the Al and Y site, respectively.

Until now, most publications on the synthesis of rare earth and transition metal doped YAlO3 have focused the Czochralski growing process that is used for the growth of the single crystal [16–23]. However, this technique has two main drawbacks; high temperature of crystallization (larger than 2000 °C) and expensive production. Compared with the Czochralski growing process, sol–gel method has obvious advantages such as, requiring considerably lower temperature, good crystallinity, uniform and small sized (microns) precipitated particles, homogeneity, lower cost. Thus, the sample is prepared faster and cheaper by sol-gel method. Besides, phosphor particle size plays efficient role to control luminescent characteristic of lighting displays and devices and sol-gel route appears to be a rewarding method to obtain small sized particles [24–27].

Thermoluminescence dosimetry used for measuring the absorbed radiation dose and dating applications is based on the thermoluminescence (TL) phenomenon referred to the process of releasing trapped electrons and holes by thermal energy. Having some advantages like small size, low cost, reusability, high sensivity and easy reachability makes TL dosimeters a good candidate to for radiation dosimetry [28,29]. In literature there are reports on the thermoluminescence of many phosphors like aluminates, silicates, sulfates, borates, phosphates, fluorides [24,25,30–37]. The metallic oxides-based TL material has received lots of attention due to their characteristics and their possible applications for radiation dosimetry [38], especially aluminate groups have significant properties such as chemically and thermally stability, high luminescence intensity, high quantum efficiency [39,40]. With the best knowledge for personal dosimetry, a tissue-equivalent material is mainly required [41]. Rare earth and transition metal ion doped YAlO3 phosphors also have strong termoluminescent sensitivity and negligible fading [42,43]. As to YAlO3:Mn2+ phosphors, although they are not a tissue-equivalent materials, it can be considered that YAlO3:Mn2+ is a good candidate for middle- and high-dose dosimetry of ionizing radiation due to repeatability, thermal fading, dose dependence, and effect of daylight exposure [44–46].

In this work, we report on the aqueous based sol-gel synthesis that is accepted one of the easiest route to acquire homogeneous chemical composition [47] and luminescence (TL, PL) properties of YAlO3 phosphor doped/co-doped with Tb3+/Nd3+/Mn2+. Moreover, optical absorption measurements have been made and the energy band gaps of the phosphors have been calculated. Kinetic parameters consisting of kinetic degree (b), activation energy (E) and frequency factor (s) have been analyzed using the computerized glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) and peak shape method.

Pure, rare earth (Tb3+, Nd3+) and transition metal (Mn2+) doped/co-doped YAlO3 were synthesized by the sol-gel method by using yttrium nitrate [Y(NO3)3·4H2O (purity 99.99%)], aluminum nitrate [Al(NO3)3·9H2O (purity 99+%)] as preparatory materials and nitric acid (HNO3) as a chelating agent. The aqueous solution for undoped and doped YAlO3 phosphor were prepared using double distilled. The stoichiometric amounts of Y(NO3)3·4H2O was dissolved in distilled water (30 ml), then nitric acid was added into the solution with a 1:3 ratio of ions. Al(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in another beaker and then this solution was slowly added to the Y(NO3)3·4H2O + nitric acid solution mixture with continuous magnetic stirring at room temperature. The dopants were dissolved in 10 ml of ionized water and added to the prepared solution. At last, polyethylene glycol solution was added to the resultant mixture solution to get a better particle structure as a surfactant material. After stirring for 2 h, the solutions were heated at 90 °C for 8–12 h. In this period a clear gel was obtained with water evaporation and then the resultant transparent solutions were kept at 100 °C for about 24 h in an oven until homogeneously dried gels were formed. In order to remove the nitrate in them, the solutions were completely dried by increasing the heat by 10 °C from 90 °C to 200 °C in 40-min steps. Finally, Differential Thermal Analysis/Thermogravimeter Analyze (DTA/TGA) of the produced xerogel powders were performed in order to determine the heat treatment process of the synthesized materials.

The crystal phase and composition of the prepared phosphors were systematically studied by recording the XRD patterns using a PANanalytical Empyrean X-ray diffraction (XRD) appliance operated at 45 kV tube voltage and 40 mA tube current. Cu-Kα (1.5405 Å) was used as the radiation source. The data were collected from 10° to 80° (2θ in steps of 0.01313o; 75.225 s per step; 0.0445°/s scan speed and 5331 number of steps.) Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG) were carried out using Exstar S11 TG/DTA 7300 instrument to study the thermal transformation of the synthesized phosphor. The samples were heated up to 1000 °C using a heating rate of 10 °C/min under inert atmosphere (Ar). The optical absorption properties of doped and undoped YAlO3 were studied by using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer operating from 800 to 200 nm. PL data of the prepared phosphors were collected at room temperature using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 spectrofluorometer equipped with a 488 nm xenon lamp (excitation spectra) and a xenon microsecond flash lamp (decay times). TL measurements were conducted with an RA94 Reader/Analyser system that was programmed to perform a linear heat from 50 °C to 400 °C with constant heating hate of 2 °C/s in N2 atmosphere. The morphology of the samples was characterized by the Nova NanoSEM 650 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). SEM images were taken by using the Gemini SEM500. SE (secondary electron) detector was selected for SEM images, and the working distance (WD) was set to about 8.1 mm. For doped phosphorus, images were taken at 20Kx magnifications.

Calculation of kinetic parameters consisting of kinetic order (b), thermal activation energy (E), and frequency factor (s) of a thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) is very important for kinetic characterization of the material and production of more efficient dosimeters. In this work, the most widely used peak shape method [48] and computerized glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) [49] have been used to obtain the kinetic parameters by utilizing the TL glow curves of the synthesized pure and doped materials.

This method is commonly used to determine thermal activation energy (E), frequency factor (s) and kinetic order (b) based on shape and geometrical parameters of the glow peak. These parameters are calculated using shape parameters:

ω = T2 – T1 (the total width at half the maximum intensity).

δ = T2 – Tm (half width on the falling side of the glow peak).

τ = Tm – T1 (half width on the rising side of the glow peak).

μ = δ/ω (symmetry factor).where T1, T2 and Tm refers to temperature at half the maximum intensity on the rising part of the peak, temperature at half the maximum intensity on the falling part of the peak, temperature at the maximum intensity, respectively. The kinetics of the peak are determined by the calculated μ symmetry factor; it equals 0.42 for first order kinetics and 0.52 for second order kinetics.

The activation energy (E) for any order of kinetics is [48].

The main TL glow curve is composed of many overlapping glow peaks based on the factors such as ion impurities, atomic displacement or vacancy defects in the material. The CGCD method is a frequently used method to determine the number of glow peaks in the main TL curve and to estimate trap parameters activation energy (E), frequency factor (s) and kinetic order (b). For defining the best CGDC fitting, the figure of merit (FOM) [50,51] has been used and is given by

As can be seen Table 1
                        , the grain size of the undoped sample shrinked somewhat with the RE3+ addition. The sizes of grains are decreased by the addition of RE3+ and the boundaries of grains began to come out. The decrease of grain size can be described as the suppression of crystallite size due to the shrinkage of lattice symmetry.

The XRD peaks of the samples matches well with the single phase of YAlO3, orthorhombic distorted perovskite structure (a = 0.5303 nm, b = 0.7348 nm, c = 0.5169 nm,

                        ) [53]. No extra phase was detected, indicating that doping Mn2+, Tb3+ or Nd3+ does not change the structure of YAlO3. Taking into account the ionic radius of the dopants and host material cations, the dopants are probably proposed to occupy Y3+ and Al3+ sites in the YAlO3 host lattice without causing any change in the crystal structure.

The TGA and DTA have been performed on synthesized sample by the sol-gel method to understand the thermal decomposition and phase transition of the material during heating.

The thermal behaviors of the obtained phosphor have been examined during heat treatment by DTA/TG at the heating rate of 50 °C/min up to 1400 °C. Thermogravimetric curve is pointed blue in Fig. 2
                         consists of three mass losses regions with increasing temperature, and some exothermic and endothermic reaction peaks have been observed in the DTA curves. The first mass loss is 6.44% up to 250 °C. As mentioned before, the samples have been prepared by sol-gel method, this minor mass difference has possibly related with the removal absorbed water molecules by the YAlO3. DTA curve is also in agreement with the TGA curve, initial endothermic peak may indicate this phase changing. The second mass loss is from 250 to 550 °C and the lost weight which can be correspond to the combustion of the organic compounds is approximately 59.08%. The final observed mass loss (7.03%) is between 550 and 1400 °C and endothermic (at 1092 °C) and exothermic (at 1275 °C) reactions seen in DTA results may be ascribed to the crystallization of YAlO3.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis have been carried out to study the surface, morphology and grain size of the crystallites of prepared phosphors by sol-gel method. SEM micrographs and EDS graphs of YAlO3: Nd3+, YAlO3: Tb3+ and YAlO3:Mn2+/Nd3+ are shown in Fig. 3
                        (a), (b) and (c), respectively. As observed in the SEM images, clustered like structure has been distributed over all the grains, the particles show dumble in shape are agglomerated. Further, intense peaks proving the existence of host (Y, Al, O) and dopant (Mn, Nd, Tb) elements are seen in EDS spectra.

Fig. 4
                           (a–h) shows, the emission and the excitation spectra of YAlO3, YAlO3: Mn2+, YAlO3: Nd3+ (VIS), YAlO3: Nd+3 (NIR), YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ (VIS), YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ (NIR), YAlO3: Tb3+ and YAlO3: Mn2+/Tb3+, respectively.

As can be seen from Fig. 4(a), the PL spectra of irradiated crystal exhibits two emission peaks at 514 nm and 610 nm for the excitation wavelength of 336 nm which shows the maximum emission. These peaks indicate the presence of the luminescent defects in the sample formed during the synthesis by heat treatment and create electron-hole traps that cause the pure material to gain luminescence characteristics. According to the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Mn2+ shown in Fig. 4(b), YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor shows a strong green emission at 526 nm. This emission is related to the transition 4T1(G)→6A1(S) of Mn2+ ions acting as an activating center. The disadvantage of the Mn2+ activator is that the d-d optical transitions are spin and parity forbidden. Therefore, for most host materials, the luminescence intensities of these ions are weak. Further, in TL results, the Mn2+ doped sample has a very low intensity. For emission intensity, the effective factors are the amount of dopant and the energy transfer from different ions which have high absorption coefficients [54]. Taking account this, Nd3+ and Tb3+ rare earth ions have been used as co-dopant to YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor. UV and NIR emission spectra of YAlO3: Nd3+ phosphor are shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). These spectra have been taken at excitation wavelength of 348 nm for detecting emission in the visible region and at 808 nm for NIR emission. In Fig. 4(c), the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Nd3+ phosphor, characteristic emissions originating from 4G11/2 → 4I9/2 (∼423 nm), 4G9/2 → 4I9/2 (∼460 nm) and 4G7/2 → 4I9/2 (∼540 nm) transitions have been observed. According to Fig. 4(d), there are three emission bands of Nd+3 ions in the NIR spectral region of the spectrum. These three bands can be attributed to transitions 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 (∼910 nm), 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 (∼1064 nm), 4F3/2 → 4I13/2 (∼1333 nm). Besides, two emission peaks have occurred instead of a single peak due to the cleavages at the 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 transition.

Fig. 4(e) shows the VIS emission spectrum of YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ phosphor taken at excitation wavelength of 384 nm. Because the luminescence light emitted in the green spectral region is characteristic of Mn2+ ions and can be expressed as Mn2++hv→Mn3++e−. Energy transfer causes an increase in the intensity of the emission, but this expected increase could not be observed. In Fig. 4(f), Nd3+ is used as a co-dopant to YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor and the NIR emission spectrum of this material is shown. Three different luminescence peaks are observed at 910 nm, 1064 nm and 1333 nm, belonging to Nd3+ ions, in NIR emission spectrum of YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+. Although characteristic transition emissions of Nd3+ are seen in this spectrum, when compared to the spectrum observed in 4(d), it has exhibited a lower intensity. This may be explained based on nonradiative transitions, ion and O2− interactions, and energy transfer from the rare earth ions to the host material. Fig. 4(g) shows the PL spectrum of YAlO3: Tb3+ phosphor; four main peaks at 490 nm, 544 nm, 580 nm and 620 nm are associated with Tb3+ ions in YAlO3 host material. These are the 5D4→7F6 (∼490 nm), 5D4→7F5 (∼544 nm), 5D4→7F4 (∼580 nm), 5D4→7F3 (∼620 nm) transitions. The most important of these transitions is the sharpest and brightest green emission peak, which occurs at about 544 nm. Therefore, it can be said that Tb3+ doped YAlO3 phosphor has the potential to be used as a green luminescence material. In Fig. 4(h), the PL spectrum taken in the VIS region for YAlO3: Mn2+/Tb3+ phosphor is shown. As it is well known, Mn2+ exhibits a sharp peak at 550 nm due to the 4T1(G)→6A1(S) transition. By adding Tb3+ to the same material, an energy transfer has occurred from the host material to Mn2+, and from Mn2+ to Tb3+ centers, and the intensity of this peak has increased. Additionally, the emission peaks of 5D3
                           5G6→7Fj (j:6,5,4) and 5D4→7Fj (j:6,5,4,3), which are caused by the characteristic transitions of Tb3+ ions, are also observed in this spectrum.

The absorption spectra shown in Fig. 5
                           (a) have been acquired in the wavelength region of 200–800 nm for Mn2+, Nd3+ and Tb3+ doped and undoped YAlO3. As can be seen from the figure, the optical absorption spectrum of undoped YAlO3 has a broad absorption band, starting from ∼500 nm, including the UV region and shifting towards the maximum absorption at ∼240 nm. This peak at ∼240 nm is thought to arise from the characteristic electron transition between the valence and conduction band of the host crystal.

The energy band gap (Eg) is a key parameter to state the suitability of semiconductors for using in optoelectronic applications (lasers, solar cells, diodes, etc). The Tauc Plot method, most commonly met type method of calculating the optical band gap of semiconductors or amorphous samples, has been used for estimation of band gap. The Tauc equation is given by:

It is chosen as r:1/2 for direct allowed transitions, r:3/2 for direct forbidden transitions, r:2 for indirect allowed transitions, and r: 3 for indirect forbidden transitions [55]. The optical band gap energy of 2.79 eV for the undoped sample has been observed in Fig. 6
                           . Depending on the presence of Nd3+ and Tb3+ dopant ions this value has decreased to the range 2.46–2.56 eV, while

                            value in Mn2+ doped sample is higher than undoped sample (Fig. 6). Further an intermediary energy level under 2 eV has been observed in the graph of the sample with Tb3+ doped. It can be said that the TL graphs have suggested this intermediate energy level due to having the best result among the other doped samples of the Tb3+ doped sample.

The absorption spectra shown in Fig. 5(b) have been obtained in the wavelength region of 200–800 nm for Mn2+/Nd3+, Mn2+/Tb3+ doped and undoped YAlO3. As can be seen from the figure, the absorption spectra of the co-doped samples have shifted towards the blue region. Also, the bandgap narrowing observed in graphs belong to Mn2+/Nd3+and Mn2+/Tb3+ doped sample can be explained by the Burstein-Moss bandgap narrowing phenomena; Ion doping can be defined as an increase in structural defects in the host lattice and it reduces the energy band gap by the presence of intermediary energy levels in the band gap. The bandgap narrowing can be attributed to the strong s-d and p-d spin-exchange interactions between the band electrons and localized d electrons of the trivalent ions [56]. The band gap widening observed in some samples is related to the movement of Fermi level into the conduction band with increasing doping concentration. Only optical transitions containing photons with energies higher than the band gap of the undoped semiconductor are allowed. This resultant band gap is equal to sum of actual band gap plus Burstein-Moss shift [57,58].

                           i = 0.329. Accordingly, the color purities of host YAlO3, YAlO3:RE3+ (RE = Mn, Nd, Tb, Mn/Nd, Mn/Tb) were determined in the range of 69.31, 33.16, 33.45, 45.49, 76.14, 41.02%, respectively. The decrease in the color purity value is associated with the increase in the white light purity value [61]. The color purity of BaTa2O6:Mn2+ phosphor is 33.16%, which means being fairly close to white light. The color purities of the phosphors are given in Table X. Further, to examine the quality of white light, the color correlated temperature (CCT) values were calculated by McCamy Eq. (8) [61]:

                           e = 0.186. The color correlated temperature (CCT) parameters are tabulated in Table 2. The CCT values of rare earth (Tb, Nd) doped and transition metal (Mn) doped/co-doped YAlO3 were found in the range of 2126.98, 4216.56, 6964.48, 5772.09, 7789.58, 6624.19 respectively. The CIE parameters of all the phosphors are tabulated in Table 2.

The TL glow curves of synthesized phosphor have been obtained using RA'95 Reader-Analyser Thermoluminescence System with a constant heating rate of 6 °C/s in the temperature range of 50–400 °C. The studied samples have been radiated using a UV light (254 nm) for 7 min. According to the results, it is seen that the glow curve of undoped YAlO3 has higher intensity. However, the TL intensity of doped YAlO3 samples has decreased remarkably due to the defects based on the ions in the crystal structure. It is known that the suitability of a material for dosimetric applications is related to the existence of deep traps at high temperatures, narrow full width half maximum (FWHM), increasing sensitivity with increasing absorbed energy and being reusable (the repeated use of a substance in heating and irradiation) [62,63]. As can be seen in Fig. 8
                           , the peaks indicating the existence of the deep traps have identified in some of the synthesized phosphors at high temperatures.

It can be seen from presented results in Fig. 8(a) that there are two prominent TL peaks at 140 °C and 310 °C of undoped YAlO3 phosphor. The peak at 310 °C draws attention because it has the highest intensity at high temperature. This high temperature peak shows the presence of trapped electrons in deeper traps.

The main TL glow curve of each sample is composed of many overlapping glow peaks based on the factors such as ion impurities, atomic displacement or vacancy defects in the material. The CGCD method is a frequently used method to determine the peaks under this main TL curve with different activation energies by various TL resolution programs. The deconvolution of TL curve of Fig. 7(a) is shown in Fig. 8(b). Given in Table 3
                            the activation energy and frequency factor values of the resolved peaks under the main TL glow curves have been obtained by the analysis program. As to Table 4
                           , each peak is calculated with the Chen Method, also known as Peak Shape, and the kinetic order (μ), average activation energy (Eave)and frequency factor (s) values of the peaks have been calculated. As a result, when the values calculated by both methods are compared, it is seen that the results are compatible.

A single main peak around 200 °C is observed in the TL glow curve of YAlO3: Tb+3 phosphor in Fig. 9
                           (a). Based on the experimental observation, the doping of Tb+3 ion has increased the TL glow curve intensity, this behavior is a consequence of the high electron trapping ability of the defects formed by doping of the Tb+3 ion in the aluminate-based crystal lattice. It is important to note that by doping of Tb+3 ion it might be possible to improve the TL glow curve intensity. Tables 5 and 6
                           
                            show calculated kinetic parameters by CGDC and Chen's peak shape method, respectively.

Fig. 10
                            exhibits TL characteristic of the studied YAlO3: Nd3+ sample within 150–350 °C. The sample has showed maximum intensity value of TL glow curve at around 220 °C. Further, dopping Nd3+ has affected the intensity after 375 °C and a weak peak has been observed. It is thought that Nd3+ ions, which act as a luminescence center in the host crystal, cause a decrease in luminescence intensity by filling the existing atomic spaces. In order to understand the TL kinetic of YAlO3 crystal, the TL glow curve parameters (activation energy, frequency factor and kinetic order) have calculated using CGDC (Table 7
                           ) and peak shape method (Table 8
                           ).

As can be seen from the YAlO3: Mn2+ TL curve (Fig. 11
                           ), the intensity in TL curves of the YAlO3 host material has decreased by the dopping of Mn2+ ions and has not exhibited a distinct glow curve. Therefore, kinetic parameter calculation has not applied for YAlO3: Mn+2.

The Tb3+ ion has been used as the co-dopant in YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor and observed a significant increase of intensity when compared to the TL curve of YAlO3: Mn2+ phosphor (Fig. 12
                           ). Besides, the peak obtained at about 200 °C is thought to be a characteristic peak of Tb3+ in the host material. The lattice parameters calculated using CGDC and peak shape method have been reported in Tables 9 and 10
                           
                           , respectively.

In order to give the calculation values of the 6th peak among the analyzed peaks with the peak shape method (Table 10), it is necessary to obtain the T2 temperature value determined over the FWHM. However, it is not possible to calculate this value at a temperature exceeding 400 °C.

As seen in Fig. 13
                           , YAlO3: Mn+2/Nd+3 TL glow curve detected in the temperature range of 50–400 °C, there are TL peaks at temperatures exceeding 180 °C and 400 °C due to the presence of trapped electrons in deeper traps. The peak at high temperature has not been considered as TL peak because it may be related to black body radiation although this is generally encountered in the absence of nitrogen used as an inert gas during the measurement. Therefore, the measurements have repeated in nitrogen environment and the same results have been obtained. It is well known that heating rate is an efficient parameter altering the shape and peak position of the glow curve, so the heating rate may has an effect on the glow curve. The numerical solution to the CGDC and peak shape analysis of glow curve for YAlO3: Mn2+/Nd3+ is given in Tables 11 and 12
                           
                           , respectively.

Tb3+, Nd3+ rare earth ions and Mn2+ transition metal ion doped and co-doped YAP phosphor were synthesized through nitrate-based sol-gel method, characterized by SEM, XRD, optical absorption and luminescence (PL, TL) measurements. Further, the kinetic parameters of the synthesized pure and doped materials were calculated using Computerized Glow Curve Deconvolution (CGCD) and Peak Shape Method for a better understanding of the optical properties that change with the doping process. In the PL spectrum 4G11/2 → 4I9/2, 4G9/2 → 4I9/2, 4G7/2 → 4I9/2, 5D4→7F6, 5D4→7F5, 5D4→7F4 and 5D4→7F3 transitions were observed. Additionally, 5D3
                     5G6→7Fj (j:6,5,4) and 5D4→7Fj (j:6,5,4,3) transitions of YAP: Tb3+ were obtained. The optical band gap of undoped sample was calculated as 2.79 eV. Depending on the presence of Nd3+ and Tb3+ dopant ions this value was decreased to the range 2.46–2.56 eV, while

                      value in Mn2+ doped sample was higher than undoped sample. Further an intermediary energy level under 2 eV has been observed in the graph of the sample with Tb3+ doped. With the adding of dopant ions TL peaks were obtained at high temperatures. Based on the experimental results, the doping of Tb+3 ion increased the TL glow curve intensity. It is important to note that by doping of Tb+3 ion it might be possible to improve the TL glow curve intensity.

                     O strained quantum well is investigated theoretically in which the strong built-in electric field due to the spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations is included. Numerical calculations are performed using variational procedure within the single band effective mass approximation by varying the Mg composition in the barrier. The exciton oscillator strength and the exciton lifetime for radiative recombination as functions of well width and Mg content have been computed.

                     O well is investigated with the various structural parameters. The total optical absorption coefficients and the changes of refractive index as a function of normalized photon energy in the presence of built-in internal field are analyzed. The result shows that the strong built-in electric field has influence on the oscillator strength and the recombination life time of the exciton. The optical absorption coefficients and the refractive index changes strongly depend on Mg composition. The occurred blue shift of the resonant peak due to the incorporation of Mg ions will give the information about the variation of two energy levels in the quantum well.

Introduction:
Mg based ZnO polar heterostructures have attracted much attention due to the formation of polarization engineering with high mobility 2DEG [1]. Among several wide band gap semiconductors, ZnO material is considered to have high density 2DEG and a large conduction band offset. Further, Mg based ZnO multi-quantum wells can be used for device fabrications such as blue and ultraviolet electro-optical applications [2,3] and they have a large exciton binding energy allowing room temperature excitonic recombination with a high efficiency light emitting diodes. Temperature dependent Hall effect measurement exhibits a 2DEG that can be formed using ZnO⧸ZnMgO heterostructures [4]. Polarization induced 2DEG at ZnO⧸ZnMgO heterointerface has been analyzed by Mitsuaki Yano et al. [5] who estimated spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations in the c-axis direction of Zn1−x

The exciton binding energies and oscillator strengths with the inclusion of internal electric fields in GaN/AlGaN quantum wells have been calculated by a variational approach in the envelope function formalism [6]. The main feature of wurtzite quantum wells is the built-in internal electric field which is the combination of spontaneous (SP) and piezoelectric polarizations (PZ). The internal field in the well is determined from the difference of the sum of SP and PZ polarizations in the well and the barrier. The mismatch of polarizations between the well and the barrier results the quantum confined Stark effect which leads to the red-shift transition energy [7–9]. The increase in charge carriers will reduce the effective strength of internal electric field. The effect of built-in internal electric fields inside quantum wells may be taken into account for ZnO quantum wells considering spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations [10] and excitation intensity [11]. However, by means of thermal annealing, the internal electric field is observed to be suppressed [12]. This results the reduction of quantum confined Stark effect increasing the oscillator strength. The Coulomb interaction enhances the transition probability between the electron and the hole in the conduction and valence bands [13]. This property will be stimulated further with the incorporation of Mg in ZnO material in which the expansion of the wavelength tunability can be achieved. This band gap tailoring can be achieved either by tuning the well (ZnO) or composition of Mg in the barrier (ZnMgO). ZnO quantum well structures may provide larger oscillation strength, enhancement of exciton binding energy, and the tunability of operating wavelength due to the quantum confinement effect [14]. Moreover, a large internal electric field has been reported in WZ ZnO/MgZnO quantum well heterostructures with high Mg concentration and thick well widths [15]. The optical gain of ZnO/ZnMgO quantum well lasers has been investigated using the non-Markovian gain model with many-body effects [16].
In the present paper, the electronic and optical properties of an internal field induced confined exciton are reported in a ZnO/ZnMgO strained quantum well. We compute the interband emission energy as functions of well width and Mg composition of a strained ZnO/ZnMgO quantum well with and without the effect of built-in electric field. Built-in electric field due to piezoelectricity and spontaneous polarization of ZnO/ZnMgO quantum well is included. Some nonlinear optical properties as a function of photon energy are also studied. The present paper is organized in the following way. In Section 2, we outline the theory of quantum well model, the exciton binding energy, the interband emission energy, absorption coefficients and the refractive index changes. In Section 3, we discuss our numerical results. Finally, the main conclusions obtained in this paper are summarized in Section 4.

                      is the free electron mass.
The energy shifts of the strained conduction band and valence band are calculated below. The effect of strain alters the band structure causing the shift in conduction band. This results the increase in the band gap of the well and decrease in the band gap of barrier and the uniaxial strain removes the degeneracy between the heavy hole and light hole subband energy in the valence band. The band structure is evaluated by taking into consideration of the difference in band gap energies of the heterostructure constituent materials. The produced strain effects due to the heterostructure bring out an extra potential field. Consequently, the confinement potential is termed as the addition of band energy offsets due to the conduction band (valence band) and the strain-induced potential for any strained quantum well structures. The potential well of electron and hole are affected by the lattice mismatch of the inner and outer materials and the band offsets. The strain-induced potential for the conduction band in the influence of Mg- incorporation is given by [18]

                      are the spontaneous polarizations and piezoelectric polarizations of ZnO and the spontaneous polarization of ZnMgO respectively. The above values can be generally calculated by the polarity of the crystal and the strains of the quantum nanostructure. Since the wurtzite crystal lattice of ZnO and MgO lack inversion symmetry, the heterostructure will have spontaneous polarization (P

                      are variational parameters responsible for the in-plane correlation and the correlation of the relative motion in the z-direction respectively [6]. By matching the wave functions and the effective mass and their derivatives at boundaries of the quantum well and along with the normalization, we fix all the constants except the variational parameters. These constants are obtained by the interface conditions between the well and the barrier. So the wave function Eq.(17) completely describes the correlation of the electron-hole relative motion.
The Schrödinger equation is solved variationally by finding

                      and the binding energy of the exciton in the quantum well is given by the difference between the energy with and without Coulomb term. First, we concentrate on the calculation of the electronic structure of the ZnO/ZnMgO quantum well system for various Mg alloy content by calculating its subband energy (E) and subsequently the exciton binding energy. To calculate the ground-state energies of the heavy excitons, we minimize the expectation values of the Hamiltonian (Eq. (1)) calculated using a trial function with two variational parameters (Eq. (17)). Then, by using the density matrix approach, within a two-level system approach, the explicit expressions for the nonlinear optical properties such as the nonlinear optical absorption and the changes of refractive index are computed in saturation limit. The dependence of the nonlinear optical processes on the well sizes is investigated with the different Mg concentration.
The binding energy of the excitonic system is defined as

The observation of oscillator strength is imperative especially in the study of optical properties and they are related to the electronic dipole allowed absorptions. Moreover, the outcome of the results will viewed on the fine structure of the optical absorption.
The optical absorption calculations are based on the Fermi Golden rule from which the total absorption coefficient is given by [23]

                     O single quantum well for different concentration of Mg with (solid line) and without (dashed curve) the internal field due to polarization effect and the inset figure displays the variation of shift in energy as a function of Mg concentration due to polarization field for three different well widths. In all the cases, it is observed that the exciton binding energy increases with a decrease of well width, reaching a maximum value and then decreases when the well width still decreases. It is because an increase in the well width results in a spreading of the wave function which causes the lowering in the binding energy. Variation in Mg composition causes the change in the barrier height of the quantum well. As the well width approaches zero the confinement becomes negligibly small, and in the finite barrier problem the tunneling becomes huge eventually the penetration of the exciton wave function in the barriers dominates. This results in the decrease in the binding energy as the well width becomes small. The occurrence of maximum exciton binding energy with the inclusion of internal electric field as 114meV for deeper well (x=0.3) is in good agreement with earlier report by Makino et al. [25] who got the value of the exciton binding energy as 115meV. 23% enhancement of exciton binding energy is observed with the increase of Mg content from 0.1 to 0.3 for 35Å well width. This large exciton binding energy implies that the excitons play an important role in the linear and the non-linear optical response of Mg based ZnO quantum wells. The exciton confinement increases with the Mg composition. The enhancement of exciton energy with the reduction of well width is due to the spatial confinement. Thus, it is clear that any quantum device depends on the composition of the barrier material and the well size.
The effect of internal electric field on the ground-state exciton binding energy is investigated in 
                     Fig. 2. The energy shift due to the internal electric field caused by piezoelectric polarizations and spontaneous polarization for various Mg concentration as a function of well width for ZnO⧸ZnMgO quantum well. We observe that the exciton binding energy is reduced with the inclusion of the built-in electric field due to the piezo-electric polarization and spontaneous polarization. This is because the electric field pushes the electron and the hole to the opposite sides, reducing their overlap and the exciton binding energy. Moreover, we notice that this effect is more pronounced for narrow wells due to the geometrical confinement. Moreover, it is noticed this shift in internal electric field is more for larger concentration. It is due to the larger mismatch between ZnO and ZnMgO materials. It is obvious from the insert figure that with the low concentration (x=0.1) the internal field is found to be very small whereas the internal field seems to be high with the high Mg concentration [26]. This is because there occurs an increase in the spatial separation between the electron and the hole wave functions due to the large internal field. Hence, it is concluded that the built-in electric field has a large influence on the exciton states confined in the ZnO/Zn1−x

                     O quantum well for different concentration. This representation clearly brings out the quantum size effect. It is noted that the interband emission energy is decreased monotonically as the well width is increased for the ZnO⧸ZnMgO quantum well [27]. This is due to the confinement of electron-hole with respect to z-plane when the well width is increased. Narrow wells show faster change in transition energy with the Mg concentration. Further, we notice that the effect of built-in electric field reduces the interband emission energy for all the well width due to the reduction in exciton binding energy. Our theoretical values of interband emission energy are in good agreement with the experimental values [25].

                     O quantum well for different concentration; the inset figure shows the variation of internal field as a function of Mg concentration for different well widths. It is observed that the internal electric field increases monotonically as the well width decreases for all the Mg concentration but the internal field is found to be more for higher Mg concentration. Also, it is observed from the insert figure that the internal electric field increases linearly with the Mg ion content for all the well width. The contribution of the internal field, induced by both spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations, is predominant for lower well width. It is due to the geometrical confinement. For narrow wells, the asymmetry induced by internal electric fields splits the binding energy more. On the other hand, the electron remains localized and becomes insensitive for larger well widths. Thus huge internal electric fields induce an asymmetrical distribution of binding energies, the well width and the Mg concentration.
In absorption spectra, the intensity of an exciton binding energy and the envelope wave function is characterized by the oscillator strength [28]

The oscillator strength of the exciton increases as the well width increases in both the cases. This is due to the recombination rate of the electron and hole is increased slowly with the increasing the well width. Moreover it is observed that the effect of built-in electric field gains the oscillator strength.

It is found that the radiative life time of exciton monotonically increases with the well width due to the enhanced exciton oscillator strength in narrow wells [31]. The effect of built-in electric field enhances radiative life time for all the well width. The large internal field separates the electron-hole pair, hence drastically reduces their overlap integral, the oscillator strength and increases the radiative lifetime eventually [32]. Our results agree with the earlier investigations quantitatively [32–34]. Hall et al. [32] have taken the band offset value of ZnO/ZnMgO quantum well as 70:30 and found the radiative life time which is 10 times lesser than our values whereas Chuanwei Cheng et al. [34] measured the transition life time around 70ps in ZnCdO⧸ZnO multi-quantum wells (15–20Å) at low temperature.
The inset figure shows the variation of radiative life time with the Mg concentration in ZnO⧸ZnMgO quantum well for two different well widths. Higher Mg concentration will lead to higher internal field eventually enhances the radiative life time of exciton. Further, we observe that the increase in Mg concentration enhances the excitonic oscillator strength leading higher internal field eventually enhancing the radiative life time of exciton. When the well width is decreased the overlap of electron and hole wave functions reduces the exciton life time and increases the optical oscillator strength whereas a large internal field (with the Mg composition) again leads to the enhancement of radiative life time of exciton. Thus, the excitonic radiative lifetime is attributed to the alteration of overlap integral.

                      quantum well as a function of photon energy for various well width. Here, we observe that the variation of magnitude of absorption coefficient increases when the well width is decreased. It is because the exciton binding energy increases when the well width decreases. Hence it is concluded that intensity dependent nonlinear absorption coefficients near the resonant frequencies are important and it should be taken into account in studying the optical properties of exciton in the quantum well. It is observed that the absorption coefficient peak moves to the higher photon energy as the well width is decreased and it is due to the quantum confinement. As the well width decreases, the total absorption coefficient shifts toward higher energies and the magnitude also increases. It implies that the change in well width blue shifts the absorption resonance coefficients in a quantum well. It is because that the spacing between the energy levels increases due to decrease in the well width. The reason for the blue-shift is due to the higher transition energy (E
                     2−E
                     1) when the well size is decreased [35]. Further, we notice that the resonant absorption peak value is found to be linearly increasing with the decrease in well width and the energy levels are separated largely with the reduction of overlap integral due to the increase in dipole matrix. It is because there occurs a competition between the energy interval and the dipole matrix element which determines these features. Thus by decreasing the well width a remarkable blue -shift of the absorption resonant peak is induced, leading to a higher energy interval.

                      as a function of incident energy for different values of Mg concentration with the constant incident optical intensity. It is observed that as the Mg incorporation increases, the total refractive index changes shift towards the higher values and the magnitude of total refractive index increases. This is because the increase in exciton binding energy occurs with the Mg-composition. Also, it is noticed from Eq. (27) that the third order relative change in refractive index changes with photon intensity and it varies quadratically with the matrix element of the electric dipole moment of the transition. Thus, the nonlinear term must be considered when calculating the refractive index changes of quantum well systems in which the incident light propagates along the z-axis [36]. Thus, the nonlinear term must be considered when calculating the refractive index changes in low dimensional semiconductor systems.

                     O strained quantum well. The interband emission energy as functions of well width and Mg concentration has been computed. Some nonlinear optical properties such as absorption coefficients and the changes in refractive index as a function of photon energy have been discussed. The quantum size effect has been demonstrated by the blue shift of the absorption spectrum with decreasing well width and the increase in Mg composition leads to the enhancement of exciton binding energy due to the decrease in spatial separation between electron and hole. The interband optical transitions are significantly affected by the piezoelectric polarization and the spontaneous polarization in the wurtzite structure. This investigation together with the a larger exciton binding energy suggests that internal field induced excitons play an important role in the linear and nonlinear optical response of Mg based ZnO-based quantum wells. However, it is imperative to have an exact description of the excitonic properties in order to understand some of the relevant optoelectronic phenomena of interest for modern technology, e.g., lasing, optical modulation and nonlinear switching. We hope that the obtained results are useful for the design of some opto-photoelectronic devices.

Mg based ZnO polar heterostructures have attracted much attention due to the formation of polarization engineering with high mobility 2DEG [1]. Among several wide band gap semiconductors, ZnO material is considered to have high density 2DEG and a large conduction band offset. Further, Mg based ZnO multi-quantum wells can be used for device fabrications such as blue and ultraviolet electro-optical applications [2,3] and they have a large exciton binding energy allowing room temperature excitonic recombination with a high efficiency light emitting diodes. Temperature dependent Hall effect measurement exhibits a 2DEG that can be formed using ZnO⧸ZnMgO heterostructures [4]. Polarization induced 2DEG at ZnO⧸ZnMgO heterointerface has been analyzed by Mitsuaki Yano et al. [5] who estimated spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations in the c-axis direction of Zn1−x

The exciton binding energies and oscillator strengths with the inclusion of internal electric fields in GaN/AlGaN quantum wells have been calculated by a variational approach in the envelope function formalism [6]. The main feature of wurtzite quantum wells is the built-in internal electric field which is the combination of spontaneous (SP) and piezoelectric polarizations (PZ). The internal field in the well is determined from the difference of the sum of SP and PZ polarizations in the well and the barrier. The mismatch of polarizations between the well and the barrier results the quantum confined Stark effect which leads to the red-shift transition energy [7–9]. The increase in charge carriers will reduce the effective strength of internal electric field. The effect of built-in internal electric fields inside quantum wells may be taken into account for ZnO quantum wells considering spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations [10] and excitation intensity [11]. However, by means of thermal annealing, the internal electric field is observed to be suppressed [12]. This results the reduction of quantum confined Stark effect increasing the oscillator strength. The Coulomb interaction enhances the transition probability between the electron and the hole in the conduction and valence bands [13]. This property will be stimulated further with the incorporation of Mg in ZnO material in which the expansion of the wavelength tunability can be achieved. This band gap tailoring can be achieved either by tuning the well (ZnO) or composition of Mg in the barrier (ZnMgO). ZnO quantum well structures may provide larger oscillation strength, enhancement of exciton binding energy, and the tunability of operating wavelength due to the quantum confinement effect [14]. Moreover, a large internal electric field has been reported in WZ ZnO/MgZnO quantum well heterostructures with high Mg concentration and thick well widths [15]. The optical gain of ZnO/ZnMgO quantum well lasers has been investigated using the non-Markovian gain model with many-body effects [16].

In the present paper, the electronic and optical properties of an internal field induced confined exciton are reported in a ZnO/ZnMgO strained quantum well. We compute the interband emission energy as functions of well width and Mg composition of a strained ZnO/ZnMgO quantum well with and without the effect of built-in electric field. Built-in electric field due to piezoelectricity and spontaneous polarization of ZnO/ZnMgO quantum well is included. Some nonlinear optical properties as a function of photon energy are also studied. The present paper is organized in the following way. In Section 2, we outline the theory of quantum well model, the exciton binding energy, the interband emission energy, absorption coefficients and the refractive index changes. In Section 3, we discuss our numerical results. Finally, the main conclusions obtained in this paper are summarized in Section 4.

                      is the free electron mass.

The energy shifts of the strained conduction band and valence band are calculated below. The effect of strain alters the band structure causing the shift in conduction band. This results the increase in the band gap of the well and decrease in the band gap of barrier and the uniaxial strain removes the degeneracy between the heavy hole and light hole subband energy in the valence band. The band structure is evaluated by taking into consideration of the difference in band gap energies of the heterostructure constituent materials. The produced strain effects due to the heterostructure bring out an extra potential field. Consequently, the confinement potential is termed as the addition of band energy offsets due to the conduction band (valence band) and the strain-induced potential for any strained quantum well structures. The potential well of electron and hole are affected by the lattice mismatch of the inner and outer materials and the band offsets. The strain-induced potential for the conduction band in the influence of Mg- incorporation is given by [18]

                      and the binding energy of the exciton in the quantum well is given by the difference between the energy with and without Coulomb term. First, we concentrate on the calculation of the electronic structure of the ZnO/ZnMgO quantum well system for various Mg alloy content by calculating its subband energy (E) and subsequently the exciton binding energy. To calculate the ground-state energies of the heavy excitons, we minimize the expectation values of the Hamiltonian (Eq. (1)) calculated using a trial function with two variational parameters (Eq. (17)). Then, by using the density matrix approach, within a two-level system approach, the explicit expressions for the nonlinear optical properties such as the nonlinear optical absorption and the changes of refractive index are computed in saturation limit. The dependence of the nonlinear optical processes on the well sizes is investigated with the different Mg concentration.

The binding energy of the excitonic system is defined as

                         which determines the fine state of the electron after absorption. Hence the state, L=0, is taken as the ground state and the state, L=1, is taken as the final state. The observation of oscillator strength is imperative especially in the study of optical properties and they are related to the electronic dipole allowed absorptions. Moreover, the outcome of the results will viewed on the fine structure of the optical absorption.

The optical absorption calculations are based on the Fermi Golden rule from which the total absorption coefficient is given by [23]

                     O single quantum well for different concentration of Mg with (solid line) and without (dashed curve) the internal field due to polarization effect and the inset figure displays the variation of shift in energy as a function of Mg concentration due to polarization field for three different well widths. In all the cases, it is observed that the exciton binding energy increases with a decrease of well width, reaching a maximum value and then decreases when the well width still decreases. It is because an increase in the well width results in a spreading of the wave function which causes the lowering in the binding energy. Variation in Mg composition causes the change in the barrier height of the quantum well. As the well width approaches zero the confinement becomes negligibly small, and in the finite barrier problem the tunneling becomes huge eventually the penetration of the exciton wave function in the barriers dominates. This results in the decrease in the binding energy as the well width becomes small. The occurrence of maximum exciton binding energy with the inclusion of internal electric field as 114meV for deeper well (x=0.3) is in good agreement with earlier report by Makino et al. [25] who got the value of the exciton binding energy as 115meV. 23% enhancement of exciton binding energy is observed with the increase of Mg content from 0.1 to 0.3 for 35Å well width. This large exciton binding energy implies that the excitons play an important role in the linear and the non-linear optical response of Mg based ZnO quantum wells. The exciton confinement increases with the Mg composition. The enhancement of exciton energy with the reduction of well width is due to the spatial confinement. Thus, it is clear that any quantum device depends on the composition of the barrier material and the well size.

The effect of internal electric field on the ground-state exciton binding energy is investigated in 
                     Fig. 2. The energy shift due to the internal electric field caused by piezoelectric polarizations and spontaneous polarization for various Mg concentration as a function of well width for ZnO⧸ZnMgO quantum well. We observe that the exciton binding energy is reduced with the inclusion of the built-in electric field due to the piezo-electric polarization and spontaneous polarization. This is because the electric field pushes the electron and the hole to the opposite sides, reducing their overlap and the exciton binding energy. Moreover, we notice that this effect is more pronounced for narrow wells due to the geometrical confinement. Moreover, it is noticed this shift in internal electric field is more for larger concentration. It is due to the larger mismatch between ZnO and ZnMgO materials. It is obvious from the insert figure that with the low concentration (x=0.1) the internal field is found to be very small whereas the internal field seems to be high with the high Mg concentration [26]. This is because there occurs an increase in the spatial separation between the electron and the hole wave functions due to the large internal field. Hence, it is concluded that the built-in electric field has a large influence on the exciton states confined in the ZnO/Zn1−x

                     O quantum well for different concentration. This representation clearly brings out the quantum size effect. It is noted that the interband emission energy is decreased monotonically as the well width is increased for the ZnO⧸ZnMgO quantum well [27]. This is due to the confinement of electron-hole with respect to z-plane when the well width is increased. Narrow wells show faster change in transition energy with the Mg concentration. Further, we notice that the effect of built-in electric field reduces the interband emission energy for all the well width due to the reduction in exciton binding energy. Our theoretical values of interband emission energy are in good agreement with the experimental values [25].

                     O quantum well for different concentration; the inset figure shows the variation of internal field as a function of Mg concentration for different well widths. It is observed that the internal electric field increases monotonically as the well width decreases for all the Mg concentration but the internal field is found to be more for higher Mg concentration. Also, it is observed from the insert figure that the internal electric field increases linearly with the Mg ion content for all the well width. The contribution of the internal field, induced by both spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations, is predominant for lower well width. It is due to the geometrical confinement. For narrow wells, the asymmetry induced by internal electric fields splits the binding energy more. On the other hand, the electron remains localized and becomes insensitive for larger well widths. Thus huge internal electric fields induce an asymmetrical distribution of binding energies, the well width and the Mg concentration.

In absorption spectra, the intensity of an exciton binding energy and the envelope wave function is characterized by the oscillator strength [28]

The oscillator strength of the exciton increases as the well width increases in both the cases. This is due to the recombination rate of the electron and hole is increased slowly with the increasing the well width. Moreover it is observed that the effect of built-in electric field gains the oscillator strength.

It is found that the radiative life time of exciton monotonically increases with the well width due to the enhanced exciton oscillator strength in narrow wells [31]. The effect of built-in electric field enhances radiative life time for all the well width. The large internal field separates the electron-hole pair, hence drastically reduces their overlap integral, the oscillator strength and increases the radiative lifetime eventually [32]. Our results agree with the earlier investigations quantitatively [32–34]. Hall et al. [32] have taken the band offset value of ZnO/ZnMgO quantum well as 70:30 and found the radiative life time which is 10 times lesser than our values whereas Chuanwei Cheng et al. [34] measured the transition life time around 70ps in ZnCdO⧸ZnO multi-quantum wells (15–20Å) at low temperature.

The inset figure shows the variation of radiative life time with the Mg concentration in ZnO⧸ZnMgO quantum well for two different well widths. Higher Mg concentration will lead to higher internal field eventually enhances the radiative life time of exciton. Further, we observe that the increase in Mg concentration enhances the excitonic oscillator strength leading higher internal field eventually enhancing the radiative life time of exciton. When the well width is decreased the overlap of electron and hole wave functions reduces the exciton life time and increases the optical oscillator strength whereas a large internal field (with the Mg composition) again leads to the enhancement of radiative life time of exciton. Thus, the excitonic radiative lifetime is attributed to the alteration of overlap integral.

                      quantum well as a function of photon energy for various well width. Here, we observe that the variation of magnitude of absorption coefficient increases when the well width is decreased. It is because the exciton binding energy increases when the well width decreases. Hence it is concluded that intensity dependent nonlinear absorption coefficients near the resonant frequencies are important and it should be taken into account in studying the optical properties of exciton in the quantum well. It is observed that the absorption coefficient peak moves to the higher photon energy as the well width is decreased and it is due to the quantum confinement. As the well width decreases, the total absorption coefficient shifts toward higher energies and the magnitude also increases. It implies that the change in well width blue shifts the absorption resonance coefficients in a quantum well. It is because that the spacing between the energy levels increases due to decrease in the well width. The reason for the blue-shift is due to the higher transition energy (E
                     2−E
                     1) when the well size is decreased [35]. Further, we notice that the resonant absorption peak value is found to be linearly increasing with the decrease in well width and the energy levels are separated largely with the reduction of overlap integral due to the increase in dipole matrix. It is because there occurs a competition between the energy interval and the dipole matrix element which determines these features. Thus by decreasing the well width a remarkable blue -shift of the absorption resonant peak is induced, leading to a higher energy interval.

                      as a function of incident energy for different values of Mg concentration with the constant incident optical intensity. It is observed that as the Mg incorporation increases, the total refractive index changes shift towards the higher values and the magnitude of total refractive index increases. This is because the increase in exciton binding energy occurs with the Mg-composition. Also, it is noticed from Eq. (27) that the third order relative change in refractive index changes with photon intensity and it varies quadratically with the matrix element of the electric dipole moment of the transition. Thus, the nonlinear term must be considered when calculating the refractive index changes of quantum well systems in which the incident light propagates along the z-axis [36]. Thus, the nonlinear term must be considered when calculating the refractive index changes in low dimensional semiconductor systems.

                     O strained quantum well. The interband emission energy as functions of well width and Mg concentration has been computed. Some nonlinear optical properties such as absorption coefficients and the changes in refractive index as a function of photon energy have been discussed. The quantum size effect has been demonstrated by the blue shift of the absorption spectrum with decreasing well width and the increase in Mg composition leads to the enhancement of exciton binding energy due to the decrease in spatial separation between electron and hole. The interband optical transitions are significantly affected by the piezoelectric polarization and the spontaneous polarization in the wurtzite structure. This investigation together with the a larger exciton binding energy suggests that internal field induced excitons play an important role in the linear and nonlinear optical response of Mg based ZnO-based quantum wells. However, it is imperative to have an exact description of the excitonic properties in order to understand some of the relevant optoelectronic phenomena of interest for modern technology, e.g., lasing, optical modulation and nonlinear switching. We hope that the obtained results are useful for the design of some opto-photoelectronic devices.

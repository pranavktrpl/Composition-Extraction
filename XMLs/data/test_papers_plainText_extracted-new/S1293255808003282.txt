Title:
Self-lubricating Ti–C–N nanocomposite coatings prepared by double magnetron sputtering

Abstract:
This paper is devoted to the development of Ti(C,N)-based nanocomposite protective coatings consisting of nanocrystals of a hard phase (TiN or TiC

                     ) embedded in an amorphous carbon-based matrix (a-C or a-CN
                        x
                     ). The objective here is the achievement of a good compromise between the mechanical and tribological properties by the appropriate control of the hard/soft phase ratio and the microstructural characteristics of the film. To achieve this purpose, dual magnetron sputtering technique was employed following two different strategies. In the first one, we use Ti and graphite targets and Ar/N2 gas mixtures, while in the second case, TiN and graphite targets are sputtered in an Ar atmosphere. By changing the sputtering power applied to each magnetron, different sets of samples are prepared for each route. The effect of the bias voltage applied to the substrate is also studied in some selected cases. The mechanical and tribological properties of the films are characterized and correlated with the microstructure, crystallinity and phase composition. The establishment of correlations enables the development of advanced coatings with tailored mechanical and tribological properties for desired applications.

Introduction:
In recent years, nanocomposite protective films have gained popularity among researchers because of their superior mechanical properties compared to the traditional single-phase films. Superhard nanocomposites based on the combination of various transition metal nitrides have been reported in the last decade, displaying hardness values ranging from 40 to 60GPa, typically with excellent thermal stability (e.g. nc-TiN/a-Si3N4, nc-TiN/a-Si3N4/a- and nc-TiSi2, nc-(Ti1−x
                     Al
                        x
                     )N/a-Si3N4, nc-TiN/TiB2, nc-TiN/BN, etc.) [1–9]. These materials are excellent candidates for protective applications on cutting or drilling tools; however, they exhibit reduced ductility as a consequence of their inhibition of dislocation generation and motion. For tribological applications, other properties, such as low friction, wear resistance, toughness and load capacity, are also needed in order to prevent brittle fracture. In addition, the risk of delamination exists due to the high internal stress levels of the coating, especially under severe conditions. One way to improve the composite toughness is to combine the hard nanocrystalline phase with a soft matrix. This design maintains the crystallite size of the hard phase at the nanometric level (5–20nm) separated by a second soft phase with a thickness in the nanometer range in order to relax the incoherence stress. This configuration presents a large volume of grain boundaries, which restricts the initial crack sizes and helps to deflect and terminate the growing cracks. Also, the presence of an amorphous boundary phase facilitates grain boundary sliding, thereby introducing ductility and preventing fracture under severe loading conditions. If this soft matrix has good tribological properties, we can simultaneously obtain a continuous supply of lubricant at the contact, which increases the tribo-mechanical performance in dry lubricated conditions. These investigations illustrate how the mechanical and tribological properties can be optimized by the appropriate combination of crystallite size, distribution of crystals in the matrix, and phase composition.
One of the most studied nanocomposites is the nc-TiC/a-C(H) system [10–18] after Voevodin reported a fourfold increase in the toughness in comparison with nanocrystalline single-phase TiC [19]. Although comparatively to a lesser extent, other groups have synthesized nanocomposite coatings by replacing the TiC by TiN and TiCN phases inside a lubricant matrix [20–22]. For example, Gilmore mixed TiN with MoS2 to achieve a friction around 0.1 and a hardness of 20GPa. Barshilia et al. described the growth of TiN/a-C nanocomposites by reactive magnetron sputtering of Ti and C targets with a hardness optimum at 17at.% of C.
In the present work, nanocomposite coatings based on the combination of Ti(C,N) phases in a carbonaceous matrix are prepared in two different ways: by reactive sputtering with Ar+N2 plasma of a Ti target or direct sputtering of a TiN target. The carbon concentrations in the films are modified by controlling the power ratio applied to the Ti(N) and graphite targets. Both sets of coatings are investigated in terms of microstructure and phase composition by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction (ED), and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). The tribological and mechanical properties are comparatively evaluated by pin-on-disk and ultramicroindentation tests, in order to obtain information about the relationship between the observed practical performance and the film composition.

Experimental details:
Ti(C,N) coatings were prepared on AISI M2 polished steel (H
                     =16GPa), Si (100) and NaCl substrates by co-sputtering of titanium (Goodfellow, 99.99% purity) or titanium nitride (Goodfellow, 99% purity) and graphite (Goodfellow, 99.9995% purity) targets (2″ diameter) in Ar or Ar/N2 discharges. The magnetrons were connected to d.c. (graphite) and r.f. (Ti or TiN) sources, respectively. The pressure of the vacuum chamber was measured before deposition at 6.5×10−4
                     Pa, and was at about 0.75Pa while growing. Two sets of samples were prepared using the Ti target and Ar/N2 (7% N2 in volumetric flow) in the gas phase (samples G) or the TiN target and Ar (samples T) with different powers applied to each magnetron. A hybrid sample (TG) was prepared combining nitrogen in the plasma and TiN target. The substrates were mounted in a rotary sample holder (10rpm) to ensure homogeneity. A negative d.c. bias of 100V was applied to the substrate holder for specific samples. The temperature was found to vary in the range of 150–200°C under the effect of the plasma. No additional heating of the substrates was done.
The sputtering conditions and the chemical compositions determined by EELS and XPS are summarized in Table 1
                     . The denomination of the samples follows the general form G/T-R(b), where the G or T prefix indicates the source employed for the nitrogen introduction (G for gas phase; T for sputtering target), R means the power ratio applied to the magnetron (W
                     C/W
                     Ti(N)), and b denotes bias (when applied). A titanium or titanium nitride underlayer of 200nm in thickness has been previously deposited to enhance the adhesion to the substrates. The film thicknesses varied typically between 0.6 and 1μm. Deposition time of the whole process was 4h.
The TEM, ED and EELS measurements were carried out with a Philips CM200 microscope operating at 200kV and equipped with a parallel detection EELS spectrometer from Gatan (766-2K). For their observation, the films grown on the NaCl substrates were floated off in water and supported on a holey carbon grid. The C, N, O and Ti core-loss edges were recorded in the diffraction mode with a camera length of 470mm. The use of a 2mm spectrometer entrance aperture yielded an energy resolution at the zero-loss peak of 1.4eV. The spectra were recorded for dark current and channel-to-channel gain variation. Low-loss spectra were also recorded with the same illumination area (≈1μm in diameter). Commercial TiN powder and an amorphous a-CN
                        x
                      film [23] were measured under the same conditions as reference compounds. After the subtraction of the background by a standard power-law function, the spectra were deconvoluted for plural scattering with the Fourier-ratio method and normalized to the jump. All of these treatments were performed within the EL/P program (Gatan). For quantification, the sensitivity factors supplied by the software were corrected using the reference compounds.
The XRD measurements were carried out using Cu Kα radiation (1.54Å) in a Siemens D5000 diffractometer at an incidence angle of 1°.
The XPS equipment was a VG-Escalab 210 Spectrometer working in the constant analyzer energy mode with a pass energy of 50eV and non-monochromatic Mg Kα radiation (1253.6eV) as the excitation source. Unless it is clearly stated, the chemical analysis corresponds to the sample surface after exposure to air without prior ion etching process.
The tribological properties of the coatings were evaluated by ball-on-disk friction tests in unlubricated sliding against AISI52100 6-mm steel balls in ambient air at a relative humidity between 40 and 50%. The test parameters were set to 5N of applied load (maximum initial Hertzian contact pressure of 1.12GPa), 10cm/s of linear speed, and 1000m of sliding distance. Normalized wear rates (mm3/Nm) were evaluated from cross-sectional profiles taken across the disk-wear track, after testing by means of stylus profilometry.
The microhardness was measured on coated M2 steel disks with a Fischerscope H100 dynamic microprobe instrument using a conventional Vickers indenter with loads up to 10mN. The maximum load was selected in such a way that the maximum indentation depth did not exceed 10–15% of the coating thickness, in order to avoid the influence of the substrate. The test parameters were fixed to an initial load of 0.4mN up to a maximum load of 10mN, in 40 load steps, with a time between two load steps of 0.5s and a test cycle with loading and unloading. The hardness and reduced Young's modulus were calculated from the load–unload displacement curves by the Fischerscope software.
To calculate the values of stress, the Stoney's equation was employed. The curvature was estimated by measuring 20-mm profiles on coatings deposited over silicon substrates.

                     Chemical composition
                     The chemical composition of the samples was determined by the quantitative EELS technique and the obtained results are presented in Table 1, together with the sputtering powers used during the deposition. The Ti/N ratio measured by EELS is compared with the Ti/N ratio obtained by the XPS analysis. The samples were not submitted to Ar etching to avoid the alteration of the chemical composition by preferential sputtering. Accordingly, the surfaces are affected by adventitious carbon and oxygen contaminations, and only the Ti/N ratio can be taken into account in comparing the samples. Thus, both series agree that the ratio of Ti/N is close to unity except when N2 gas is present in the sputtering plasma together with the carbon species. The most plausible explanation for this effect is that the N2
                        + ions promote the formation of CN
                           x
                         compounds, as has been observed in many previous papers reporting the synthesis of CN
                           x
                         films [23–25].
                     
                        Fig. 1
                         shows the chemical composition of the samples obtained by quantitative EELS plotted in a ternary diagram. In respect to the procedure used for the synthesis, the T samples are aligned in a vertical line equidistant from Ti and N (ratio Ti/N≈1), whereas the G samples are situated in a parallel line shifted to the right (ratio Ti/N<1). This influence of the nitrogen used in the sputtering gas is also demonstrated in a special sample (TG0.5), where N2 was employed simultaneously with the TiN target as nitrogen source. The effect of introducing nitrogen in the gas phase is manifested in the horizontal displacement of the chemical composition of the sample T0.5 towards the N region. The G0.5 sample is situated in the same vertical line than TG0.5 but immediately below. This means that the replacement of the TiN target by reactive sputtering of Ti reduces the C in the samples but maintains a constant Ti/N ratio. In both series, the carbon contents increase as the power ratio increases. The samples from the T family can be described as a combination of near-stoichiometric TiN and C. In the G samples, the excess of N might be linked to C in the form of CN

3.2
                     Crystalline structure
                     The crystalline phases present in the coatings have been evaluated by means of grazing incidence XRD. Fig. 2
                         shows a selected region of the XRD patterns where the peak position for the TiC, TiN and TiC
                           x
                        N
                           y
                         phases are marked. Peaks from metallic Ti and Fe are observed in some cases, due to the underlayers used for improving the adhesion and the M2 steel substrate, respectively. The main peak at 61–62° (2θ angle) is situated in the vicinity of TiN, although its position can be affected by the presence of other Ti(C,N) phases and the residual stress in the coatings. The residual stress, as it is shown later, is only significant for the G0b and T0b samples prepared with bias assistance. In the remaining cases, the shift towards lower angles can be interpreted by the formation of ternary TiC
                           x
                        N
                           y
                         (TiN0.3C0.7 and/or TiN0.7C0.3), whose lattice parameter is between the TiN and TiC phases. This effect is clearly manifested in sample T0.5. The Ti/N ratio measured by XPS for this sample is 1.3, which is indicative of the existence of TiN
                           x
                        C
                           y
                        .
                     A peak broadening is also observed simultaneously with the increment of the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio, indicating a diminution of the coherent diffraction domains. Higher power ratios promote higher carbon incorporation and therefore a higher proportion of amorphous phases (a-C and a-CN
                           x
                        ). This trend is more evident in the G samples, whose crystallinities are poorer than the T samples, and the formation of amorphous CN
                           x
                         phase by the nitrogen gas used for sputtering is possible. This amorphization trend is demonstrated in Fig. 2c by the comparison of the samples prepared at a ratio of 0.5 in different configurations. An increment of the peak intensity is observed in parallel with the removal of N2 from the gas phase and the employment of the TiN target. These differences can be explained as a result of the higher energy transfer to the N atoms by the non-reactive process. In the case of reactive sputtering, energy is also needed to dissociate the molecular nitrogen gas and the surface diffusivity of the adatoms is reduced by the adsorbed gas atom (N) [26].

                     Microstructure
                     
                        Fig. 3
                         shows the TEM micrographs of coatings prepared at a ratio of 0, with and without bias, together with their associated electron diffraction patterns. The film microstructure is rather crystalline in all cases, as can be deduced from the TEM pictures and the presence of well-defined electron diffraction rings. Their associated d-spacings are in agreement with cubic TiN phase. The films are constituted by crystals of irregular shape and size (3–20nm), although the average value is smaller in the G series. The microstructure of the T films appears to be unaffected by the application of substrate bias, while in the case of G sample, the lack of bias leads to a film microstructure formed by very fine grains (below 10nm). Fig. 4
                         denotes the influence of carbon incorporation, with pictures taken of samples deposited at increasing power ratios. The increment of the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) sputtering power ratio led to a more amorphous structure, as denoted by the presence of finer grains (1–10nm) and more diffuse diffraction rings.
3.4
                     Chemical bonding
                     In order to investigate the chemical bonding structure, EELS and XPS techniques were applied to these series of nanocomposite coatings. These techniques do not require the long-range order that XRD needs and, thus, information concerning the chemical state of the elements inside the matrix can be obtained.
                     
                        Fig. 5
                         shows the energy-loss spectra for the samples under study together with several references of pure TiC and TiN powders, and amorphous C and CN
                           x
                         films prepared by magnetron sputtering. In the case of C K-edge and N K-edge, the near-edge fine structure (ELNES) of TiC and TiN is dominated by well-separated strong π and σ peaks of approximately equal intensity situated at 283 and 292eV (TiC) and 395 and 405eV (TiN), respectively [27,28]. On the other side, the references for the amorphous carbon-based compounds are characterized by the existence of a narrow π peak (285eV) and a broad σ peak centered at 295eV. The contribution of the 1s→π* transitions appear more resolved and intense in the CN
                           x
                         compounds than in amorphous C, due to the participation of the lone electron pair of nitrogen in the π bonding states [29]. The comparison of the ELNES spectra obtained for the nanostructured films demonstrates that the carbon nature is essentially amorphous, a-CN
                           x
                         and a-C, except for the T0.5 sample, where the change in shape seems to point out the presence of certain carbide species. The shape of the N K-edge does not change very much among different samples and looks very similar to TiN, although the contribution of N in the amorphous CN
                           x
                         compounds begins to be relevant for the highest ratio. This is particularly the case of the G series in agreement with what was observed by the XPS and the peak broadening by XRD.
                     XPS analysis was carried out with the aim of obtaining further information on the chemical bonding. Fig. 6
                         depicts the Ti2p, N1s and C1s photoelectron peaks for both series of samples. The Ti2p signals are ordered by increasing power ratio, as this parameter is controlling the Ti incorporation inside the coating. Two components are clearly identified at 458.5eV and 455.5eV, due to the TiO2 and TiN phases. A third component is usually situated in the middle of both peaks due to the oxynitride species (Ti–ON) and/or a satellite shake-up peak [30]. This latter appears more intense in the G series where N2 gas is used as the N-source. By fitting the analysis of Ti 2p3/2, the TiN/TiON area ratios are found to be 0.66 and 1.07 for the G and T series, respectively. Considering that the amount of Ti incorporated in the films is approximately the same for similar ratios in both series, this can be interpreted as a higher concentration of Ti–N bonds in the T samples together with a higher presence of Ti–ON species in the G samples. Three signals are observed in the N1s peak, due to the TiN (∼397.0eV), CN
                           x
                         (∼399.3 and ∼400.8eV) and N–O (∼403.0eV, only in the sample B0b) components [31,32]. In the T series, the major contribution arises from TiN, in agreement with the Ti2p analysis, and its intensity decreases in parallel with the increment of the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio. In this series, the presence of CN
                           x
                         is minimal when compared with the G samples. The content of the CN
                           x
                         species grows with the increment of the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio, with a maximum in the G2 sample (W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N)
                        =2). The main contribution of the C1s appears at 285.2eV, due to C–C bonds, while the shoulder towards the higher energies is attributed to the CN
                           x
                         species [29,32]. Nevertheless, the existence of the adventitious hydrocarbon contamination layer on the surface of the sample makes the deeper study on the C1s peaks difficult. Sample T0.5 exhibits a small contribution at ∼282eV, indicative of carbide bonds [19]. This correlates with the formation of the ternary compound TiN
                           x

                           y
                        , as suggested by XRD and EELS analyses.
                     To have a clearer insight on the species present in this particular sample, the XPS spectra after Ar+ ion etching are presented in Fig. 7
                        . The Ti2p, N1s and C1s photoelectron peaks appear deconvoluted into the different components stated previously. The predominance of Ti–N species is demonstrated from the position and intensity of this bonding type in the Ti2p and N1s peaks at 455.5 and 397eV, respectively [30,31]. The removal of carbon adventitious layer allows to distinguish two different contributions in the C1s peak at 282.2 and 284.6eV that can be assigned to C–Ti and C–C bonds. These results make plausible the assumption of ternary TiN

                     Tribological properties
                     
                        Fig. 8
                         shows the tribological properties (friction coefficient and wear resistance) for both series of samples. The increment of the sputtering W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio influences the tribological properties, as it controls the microstructure and phase composition of the coatings. The higher the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio, the lower the friction and wear values, although the G samples always gave worse performance. The friction coefficient exhibits a drastic decrease from 0.6–0.7 to values below 0.3 when combining the sputtering of the Ti(N) target with graphite. This supports that the introduction of amorphous carbon-based phases (a-C and a-CN
                           x
                        ) into the film has occurred, which can play the role of lubricants. The high friction response corresponds, therefore, to a predominance of the hard crystalline TiN phase.
                     Regarding the wear rate the trends are similar. The coatings exhibit higher wear resistance as the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio increases although the improvement in the T series is more noteworthy. This latter can be correlated with the crystallinity of the TiN phase as shown by XRD (cf. Fig. 2). The diffractograms provide evidences of higher crystalline domain sizes for the T series compared to those obtained by reactive sputtering. It is also worthy to consider the higher relative amount of TiN phase versus titanium oxinitride phases detected by XPS for these samples. Although both aspects, microstructure and phase composition, are responsible for the observed tribological behavior, it appears that the friction is mainly controlled by the kind of carbon-based lubricant phase and the wear response by the crystallinity of the hard TiN phase. The sample TG, prepared in hybrid conditions, serves as a good example to illustrate this fact. Its friction coefficient is similar to that of the G series but its wear resistance is closer in value to that of the T films. As it has been shown before, the TG sample exhibits an amorphous phase similar to the G phase (CN
                           x
                        ) but a crystalline phase typical of the T series. The CN
                           x
                         amorphous phase formed inside the Ti–C–N nanocomposites is a less efficient lubricant in comparison with the amorphous C. Besides, the wear resistance is improved if the TiN is introduced by direct sputtering of the TiN target instead of employing reactive sputtering with nitrogen on a Ti target. It is, therefore, clearly inferred that employing nitrogen in the plasma sputtering process yields coatings with worse tribological performance, both in friction and wear rates.

                     Mechanical properties
                     
                        Fig. 9
                         summarizes the Young's moduli, hardness and residual stress values of the different coatings. Again, an improvement is observed in the properties when using the TiN target, with a higher hardness and reduced elastic modulus values resulting. If we do not use bias substrate polarization, the H and E
                        ∗ values vary around 10–20GPa and 90–220GPa, respectively, with compressive stresses below 1.5GPa. However, when bias is applied, the hardness can be improved in both series, particularly for the sample T0b (45GPa), although at the expense of an increase in residual compressive stresses. Nevertheless, it must be highlighted that the improvement in hardness cannot be attributed to the residual stress. Both samples prepared with bias exhibit similar values of stress, but the hardness is significantly higher for the T0b film. In addition to hardness, recent papers emphasized the significance of the elastic strain to failure (related to H/E*), resistance to plastic deformation (related to H
                        3/E
                        ∗2) and fracture toughness (i.e. resistance to crack propagation) on having good tribological performance (particularly in abrasion, impact and erosive wear). The expressions H/E
                        ∗ and H
                        3/E
                        ∗2 (resilience) have often been used to correlate with the wear behavior [33–35], whilst the experimental determination of toughness remains a challenging task in thin films due to their limited thickness and the influence of the substrate [36,37]. By considering the equation of the “critical strain energy release for fast fracture” (G
                        c
                        =
                        πaσ
                        c/E) [37], with a as the length of a pre-existing crack, it is concluded that fracture toughness would also be improved by both a low Young's modulus and a high critical stress for fracture (σ
                        c), which implies the need for a high hardness. Similarly, using the equation for fracture toughness (K
                        IC) measured by the crack length induced by indentation, the equation contains the ratio E/H under the applied indentation load [37]. Therefore, in an attempt to correlate H/E and H
                        3/E
                        ∗2 with toughness and wear behavior, we have calculated them from the measured values of H and E∗ for the coatings deposited under different conditions.
                     
                        Fig. 10a displays the effective hardness as a function of the Young's modulus for the nanostructured Ti–C–N films investigated in this work and a reference coating of amorphous carbon. A linear relationship between H and E* is noticed for Ti–C–N nanocomposites (prepared at W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratios of 0.5, 1 and 2) as well as the TiN films (W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio of 0, with or without bias). The calculated H/E
                        ∗ values are displayed in Table 3
                        . They range from 0.08 to 0.1 providing evidence of the possibility of controlling the film hardness as a function of the effective elastic modulus by the choice of the film's chemical composition. In general, a low E
                        ∗ becomes desirable, as it allows the given load to be distributed over a wider area. However, this argument (although valid) is in contradiction to conventional fracture mechanics theory, which predicates a high modulus to prevent crack growth [38].
                     
                        Fig. 10b illustrates how the resilience H
                        3/E
                        ∗2 increases continuously with H, since the ratio H/E
                        ∗ is approximately constant in any of the two above-mentioned types of coatings. Thus, for each family of samples, it stands that the highest resistance to plastic deformation corresponds to those displaying the highest hardness properties. However, it has been stated that these films did not provide the best tribological performance.
                     The elastic recovery (W
                        e %) is plotted in Fig. 10c against the estimated H/E
                        ∗ values. This parameter is calculated from the area under the unloading portion of a typical loading/unloading curve. The most important finding that follows is the fact that high elastic recoveries are not necessarily obtained by the hardest films. In a similar way to H/E
                        ∗ and H
                        3/E
                        ∗2, the elastic recoveries are grouped into the same two families. Thus, the highest elastic recoveries (between 60 and 80%) are obtained with the group of samples with carbon (Ti–C–N nanocomposite samples and pure a-C), while the remaining samples (TiN films) gave inferior value, around 40–50%. Among the samples with C, it is observed that the greater incorporation of carbon (higher power ratios) yields higher W
                        e values. Consequently, it can be concluded that it is possible to tailor the elastic recovery properties while maintaining a similar H/E
                        ∗ value by adequately selecting the parameters used for the deposition.
                     In an attempt to compare these parameters for both groups of samples as a function of the phase composition, an estimation of the amorphous phase was performed. It is assumed that the titanium atoms are predominantly in the form of the TiN compound and that the remaining N is bonded to C as CN
                           x
                        . Otherwise, a simple correlation using the Ti content would not be correct since the nature of the amorphous phases present in both sets of films is not the same. A similar approach has been followed in a recent paper [39]. The expression used is the following:

                        Fig. 11 illustrates the correlation between the mechanical and tribological properties versus the content of the amorphous carbon (a-C and/or a-CN
                           x
                        ) inside the coatings. Fig. 11a shows that the hardness values exhibit a reduction at around 50–55% of amorphous phase, although lower values are always observed for the G samples when comparing both series in pairs. Fig. 11b plots the dependence of the resistance to plastic deformation H3/E∗2 versus the amorphous phase content. As pointed out previously, high values of H/E and H
                        3/E
                        ∗2 are of interest because they have a good ability to resist cracking during large elastic deformation; however, once this regime is overcome, they exhibit brittle fracture. In a similar way as hardness, a transition point is found between 50 and 55%. If we compare these results with the wear resistance (Fig. 11c), it is clear that the best results are not obtained from the hardest samples (i.e. the most resistant to plastic deformation). In fact, a significant improvement is obtained for the samples prepared at ratios above 1, which possess a lubricant phase content beyond 65%. The samples prepared at lower ratios (0.5 and 0) exhibit little or no amorphous lubricant content and their tribological performance is worse despite enhanced hardness properties. It is therefore concluded that the tribological performance is more affected by the predominance of an amorphous lubricant phase than the mechanical properties of the film. These results differ from previous publications, where the correlation between wear resistance and H/E ratios is emphasized [33,40]. This is the likely consequence of the tribological behavior being controlled by the friction-induced phenomena at the contact, as we showed in a recent paper of Raman analysis of the counterfaces [18].
                     In the last graph (Fig. 11d), it is observed how the values for elastic work show a continuous increase as the content of the amorphous phase does, as it was pointed out in the discussion of Fig. 10c. Interpolating the optimum range for the mechanical properties, we are situated at around 60%, whilst the region giving the best tribological performance corresponds to 70–80% of elastic work. According to the previous data [39,41], this region corresponds to an optimum toughness, as reported by Voevodin et al. as having a pseudoplastic behavior [10].
                     In summary, if the foreseen application requires low friction and wear rates, it will be necessary to increase the content of the amorphous lubricant above a threshold of 65%. A similar conclusion was obtained for a set of TiC/a-C(H) nanocomposite samples [18]. These samples correspond to film deposition carried out at W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratios of higher than 0.5. It is worth mentioning that these samples represent the transition point between these two regimes, combining good mechanical properties (moderate hardness, optimum resilience and elastic work) with a significant improvement in tribological properties. The proportion between the nanocrystalline and amorphous phases reaches an adequate balance, being close to the maximum in hardness with sufficient lubricant amorphous phase to reasonably reduce the friction and wear. Therefore, it represents a good compromise between both aspects, combining the hard nanocrystalline TiN phase with 50–65% of amorphous a-C(N) matrix that provides lubricity and toughness.

Chemical composition:
The chemical composition of the samples was determined by the quantitative EELS technique and the obtained results are presented in Table 1, together with the sputtering powers used during the deposition. The Ti/N ratio measured by EELS is compared with the Ti/N ratio obtained by the XPS analysis. The samples were not submitted to Ar etching to avoid the alteration of the chemical composition by preferential sputtering. Accordingly, the surfaces are affected by adventitious carbon and oxygen contaminations, and only the Ti/N ratio can be taken into account in comparing the samples. Thus, both series agree that the ratio of Ti/N is close to unity except when N2 gas is present in the sputtering plasma together with the carbon species. The most plausible explanation for this effect is that the N2
                        + ions promote the formation of CN
                           x
                         compounds, as has been observed in many previous papers reporting the synthesis of CN
                           x
                         films [23–25].
Fig. 1
                         shows the chemical composition of the samples obtained by quantitative EELS plotted in a ternary diagram. In respect to the procedure used for the synthesis, the T samples are aligned in a vertical line equidistant from Ti and N (ratio Ti/N≈1), whereas the G samples are situated in a parallel line shifted to the right (ratio Ti/N<1). This influence of the nitrogen used in the sputtering gas is also demonstrated in a special sample (TG0.5), where N2 was employed simultaneously with the TiN target as nitrogen source. The effect of introducing nitrogen in the gas phase is manifested in the horizontal displacement of the chemical composition of the sample T0.5 towards the N region. The G0.5 sample is situated in the same vertical line than TG0.5 but immediately below. This means that the replacement of the TiN target by reactive sputtering of Ti reduces the C in the samples but maintains a constant Ti/N ratio. In both series, the carbon contents increase as the power ratio increases. The samples from the T family can be described as a combination of near-stoichiometric TiN and C. In the G samples, the excess of N might be linked to C in the form of CN
                           x
                        .

Crystalline structure:
The crystalline phases present in the coatings have been evaluated by means of grazing incidence XRD. Fig. 2
                         shows a selected region of the XRD patterns where the peak position for the TiC, TiN and TiC
                           x
                        N
                           y
                         phases are marked. Peaks from metallic Ti and Fe are observed in some cases, due to the underlayers used for improving the adhesion and the M2 steel substrate, respectively. The main peak at 61–62° (2θ angle) is situated in the vicinity of TiN, although its position can be affected by the presence of other Ti(C,N) phases and the residual stress in the coatings. The residual stress, as it is shown later, is only significant for the G0b and T0b samples prepared with bias assistance. In the remaining cases, the shift towards lower angles can be interpreted by the formation of ternary TiC
                           x
                        N
                           y
                         (TiN0.3C0.7 and/or TiN0.7C0.3), whose lattice parameter is between the TiN and TiC phases. This effect is clearly manifested in sample T0.5. The Ti/N ratio measured by XPS for this sample is 1.3, which is indicative of the existence of TiN
                           x
                        C
                           y
                        .
A peak broadening is also observed simultaneously with the increment of the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio, indicating a diminution of the coherent diffraction domains. Higher power ratios promote higher carbon incorporation and therefore a higher proportion of amorphous phases (a-C and a-CN
                           x
                        ). This trend is more evident in the G samples, whose crystallinities are poorer than the T samples, and the formation of amorphous CN
                           x
                         phase by the nitrogen gas used for sputtering is possible. This amorphization trend is demonstrated in Fig. 2c by the comparison of the samples prepared at a ratio of 0.5 in different configurations. An increment of the peak intensity is observed in parallel with the removal of N2 from the gas phase and the employment of the TiN target. These differences can be explained as a result of the higher energy transfer to the N atoms by the non-reactive process. In the case of reactive sputtering, energy is also needed to dissociate the molecular nitrogen gas and the surface diffusivity of the adatoms is reduced by the adsorbed gas atom (N) [26].

Microstructure:
Fig. 3
                         shows the TEM micrographs of coatings prepared at a ratio of 0, with and without bias, together with their associated electron diffraction patterns. The film microstructure is rather crystalline in all cases, as can be deduced from the TEM pictures and the presence of well-defined electron diffraction rings. Their associated d-spacings are in agreement with cubic TiN phase. The films are constituted by crystals of irregular shape and size (3–20nm), although the average value is smaller in the G series. The microstructure of the T films appears to be unaffected by the application of substrate bias, while in the case of G sample, the lack of bias leads to a film microstructure formed by very fine grains (below 10nm).

Chemical bonding:
In order to investigate the chemical bonding structure, EELS and XPS techniques were applied to these series of nanocomposite coatings. These techniques do not require the long-range order that XRD needs and, thus, information concerning the chemical state of the elements inside the matrix can be obtained.
Fig. 5
                         shows the energy-loss spectra for the samples under study together with several references of pure TiC and TiN powders, and amorphous C and CN
                           x
                         films prepared by magnetron sputtering. In the case of C K-edge and N K-edge, the near-edge fine structure (ELNES) of TiC and TiN is dominated by well-separated strong π and σ peaks of approximately equal intensity situated at 283 and 292eV (TiC) and 395 and 405eV (TiN), respectively [27,28]. On the other side, the references for the amorphous carbon-based compounds are characterized by the existence of a narrow π peak (285eV) and a broad σ peak centered at 295eV. The contribution of the 1s→π* transitions appear more resolved and intense in the CN
                           x
                         compounds than in amorphous C, due to the participation of the lone electron pair of nitrogen in the π bonding states [29]. The comparison of the ELNES spectra obtained for the nanostructured films demonstrates that the carbon nature is essentially amorphous, a-CN
                           x
                         and a-C, except for the T0.5 sample, where the change in shape seems to point out the presence of certain carbide species. The shape of the N K-edge does not change very much among different samples and looks very similar to TiN, although the contribution of N in the amorphous CN
                           x
                         compounds begins to be relevant for the highest ratio. This is particularly the case of the G series in agreement with what was observed by the XPS and the peak broadening by XRD.
XPS analysis was carried out with the aim of obtaining further information on the chemical bonding. Fig. 6
                         depicts the Ti2p, N1s and C1s photoelectron peaks for both series of samples. The Ti2p signals are ordered by increasing power ratio, as this parameter is controlling the Ti incorporation inside the coating. Two components are clearly identified at 458.5eV and 455.5eV, due to the TiO2 and TiN phases. A third component is usually situated in the middle of both peaks due to the oxynitride species (Ti–ON) and/or a satellite shake-up peak [30]. This latter appears more intense in the G series where N2 gas is used as the N-source. By fitting the analysis of Ti 2p3/2, the TiN/TiON area ratios are found to be 0.66 and 1.07 for the G and T series, respectively. Considering that the amount of Ti incorporated in the films is approximately the same for similar ratios in both series, this can be interpreted as a higher concentration of Ti–N bonds in the T samples together with a higher presence of Ti–ON species in the G samples. Three signals are observed in the N1s peak, due to the TiN (∼397.0eV), CN
                           x
                         (∼399.3 and ∼400.8eV) and N–O (∼403.0eV, only in the sample B0b) components [31,32]. In the T series, the major contribution arises from TiN, in agreement with the Ti2p analysis, and its intensity decreases in parallel with the increment of the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio. In this series, the presence of CN
                           x
                         is minimal when compared with the G samples. The content of the CN
                           x
                         species grows with the increment of the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio, with a maximum in the G2 sample (W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N)
                        =2). The main contribution of the C1s appears at 285.2eV, due to C–C bonds, while the shoulder towards the higher energies is attributed to the CN
                           x
                         species [29,32]. Nevertheless, the existence of the adventitious hydrocarbon contamination layer on the surface of the sample makes the deeper study on the C1s peaks difficult. Sample T0.5 exhibits a small contribution at ∼282eV, indicative of carbide bonds [19]. This correlates with the formation of the ternary compound TiN
                           x
                        C

                        , as suggested by XRD and EELS analyses.
To have a clearer insight on the species present in this particular sample, the XPS spectra after Ar+ ion etching are presented in Fig. 7
                        . The Ti2p, N1s and C1s photoelectron peaks appear deconvoluted into the different components stated previously. The predominance of Ti–N species is demonstrated from the position and intensity of this bonding type in the Ti2p and N1s peaks at 455.5 and 397eV, respectively [30,31]. The removal of carbon adventitious layer allows to distinguish two different contributions in the C1s peak at 282.2 and 284.6eV that can be assigned to C–Ti and C–C bonds. These results make plausible the assumption of ternary TiN

                         compound in this sample. As a summary of the chemical information obtained by means of XPS and EELS techniques, Table 2
                         collects the most significant bonding types identified for the analysed coatings.

Tribological properties:
Fig. 8
                         shows the tribological properties (friction coefficient and wear resistance) for both series of samples. The increment of the sputtering W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio influences the tribological properties, as it controls the microstructure and phase composition of the coatings. The higher the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio, the lower the friction and wear values, although the G samples always gave worse performance. The friction coefficient exhibits a drastic decrease from 0.6–0.7 to values below 0.3 when combining the sputtering of the Ti(N) target with graphite. This supports that the introduction of amorphous carbon-based phases (a-C and a-CN
                           x
                        ) into the film has occurred, which can play the role of lubricants. The high friction response corresponds, therefore, to a predominance of the hard crystalline TiN phase.
Regarding the wear rate the trends are similar. The coatings exhibit higher wear resistance as the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio increases although the improvement in the T series is more noteworthy. This latter can be correlated with the crystallinity of the TiN phase as shown by XRD (cf. Fig. 2). The diffractograms provide evidences of higher crystalline domain sizes for the T series compared to those obtained by reactive sputtering. It is also worthy to consider the higher relative amount of TiN phase versus titanium oxinitride phases detected by XPS for these samples. Although both aspects, microstructure and phase composition, are responsible for the observed tribological behavior, it appears that the friction is mainly controlled by the kind of carbon-based lubricant phase and the wear response by the crystallinity of the hard TiN phase. The sample TG, prepared in hybrid conditions, serves as a good example to illustrate this fact. Its friction coefficient is similar to that of the G series but its wear resistance is closer in value to that of the T films. As it has been shown before, the TG sample exhibits an amorphous phase similar to the G phase (CN
                           x
                        ) but a crystalline phase typical of the T series. The CN
                           x
                         amorphous phase formed inside the Ti–C–N nanocomposites is a less efficient lubricant in comparison with the amorphous C. Besides, the wear resistance is improved if the TiN is introduced by direct sputtering of the TiN target instead of employing reactive sputtering with nitrogen on a Ti target. It is, therefore, clearly inferred that employing nitrogen in the plasma sputtering process yields coatings with worse tribological performance, both in friction and wear rates.

Mechanical properties:
Fig. 9
                         summarizes the Young's moduli, hardness and residual stress values of the different coatings. Again, an improvement is observed in the properties when using the TiN target, with a higher hardness and reduced elastic modulus values resulting. If we do not use bias substrate polarization, the H and E
                        ∗ values vary around 10–20GPa and 90–220GPa, respectively, with compressive stresses below 1.5GPa. However, when bias is applied, the hardness can be improved in both series, particularly for the sample T0b (45GPa), although at the expense of an increase in residual compressive stresses. Nevertheless, it must be highlighted that the improvement in hardness cannot be attributed to the residual stress. Both samples prepared with bias exhibit similar values of stress, but the hardness is significantly higher for the T0b film. In addition to hardness, recent papers emphasized the significance of the elastic strain to failure (related to H/E*), resistance to plastic deformation (related to H
                        3/E
                        ∗2) and fracture toughness (i.e. resistance to crack propagation) on having good tribological performance (particularly in abrasion, impact and erosive wear). The expressions H/E
                        ∗ and H
                        3/E
                        ∗2 (resilience) have often been used to correlate with the wear behavior [33–35], whilst the experimental determination of toughness remains a challenging task in thin films due to their limited thickness and the influence of the substrate [36,37]. By considering the equation of the “critical strain energy release for fast fracture” (G
                        c
                        =
                        πaσ
                        c/E) [37], with a as the length of a pre-existing crack, it is concluded that fracture toughness would also be improved by both a low Young's modulus and a high critical stress for fracture (σ
                        c), which implies the need for a high hardness. Similarly, using the equation for fracture toughness (K
                        IC) measured by the crack length induced by indentation, the equation contains the ratio E/H under the applied indentation load [37]. Therefore, in an attempt to correlate H/E and H
                        3/E
                        ∗2 with toughness and wear behavior, we have calculated them from the measured values of H and E∗ for the coatings deposited under different conditions.
Fig. 10a displays the effective hardness as a function of the Young's modulus for the nanostructured Ti–C–N films investigated in this work and a reference coating of amorphous carbon. A linear relationship between H and E* is noticed for Ti–C–N nanocomposites (prepared at W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratios of 0.5, 1 and 2) as well as the TiN films (W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio of 0, with or without bias). The calculated H/E
                        ∗ values are displayed in Table 3
                        . They range from 0.08 to 0.1 providing evidence of the possibility of controlling the film hardness as a function of the effective elastic modulus by the choice of the film's chemical composition. In general, a low E
                        ∗ becomes desirable, as it allows the given load to be distributed over a wider area. However, this argument (although valid) is in contradiction to conventional fracture mechanics theory, which predicates a high modulus to prevent crack growth [38].
Fig. 10b illustrates how the resilience H
                        3/E
                        ∗2 increases continuously with H, since the ratio H/E
                        ∗ is approximately constant in any of the two above-mentioned types of coatings. Thus, for each family of samples, it stands that the highest resistance to plastic deformation corresponds to those displaying the highest hardness properties. However, it has been stated that these films did not provide the best tribological performance.
The elastic recovery (W
                        e %) is plotted in Fig. 10c against the estimated H/E
                        ∗ values. This parameter is calculated from the area under the unloading portion of a typical loading/unloading curve. The most important finding that follows is the fact that high elastic recoveries are not necessarily obtained by the hardest films. In a similar way to H/E
                        ∗ and H
                        3/E
                        ∗2, the elastic recoveries are grouped into the same two families. Thus, the highest elastic recoveries (between 60 and 80%) are obtained with the group of samples with carbon (Ti–C–N nanocomposite samples and pure a-C), while the remaining samples (TiN films) gave inferior value, around 40–50%. Among the samples with C, it is observed that the greater incorporation of carbon (higher power ratios) yields higher W
                        e values. Consequently, it can be concluded that it is possible to tailor the elastic recovery properties while maintaining a similar H/E
                        ∗ value by adequately selecting the parameters used for the deposition.
In an attempt to compare these parameters for both groups of samples as a function of the phase composition, an estimation of the amorphous phase was performed. It is assumed that the titanium atoms are predominantly in the form of the TiN compound and that the remaining N is bonded to C as CN
                           x
                        . Otherwise, a simple correlation using the Ti content would not be correct since the nature of the amorphous phases present in both sets of films is not the same. A similar approach has been followed in a recent paper [39]. The expression used is the following:

Fig. 11 illustrates the correlation between the mechanical and tribological properties versus the content of the amorphous carbon (a-C and/or a-CN
                           x
                        ) inside the coatings. Fig. 11a shows that the hardness values exhibit a reduction at around 50–55% of amorphous phase, although lower values are always observed for the G samples when comparing both series in pairs. Fig. 11b plots the dependence of the resistance to plastic deformation H3/E∗2 versus the amorphous phase content. As pointed out previously, high values of H/E and H
                        3/E
                        ∗2 are of interest because they have a good ability to resist cracking during large elastic deformation; however, once this regime is overcome, they exhibit brittle fracture. In a similar way as hardness, a transition point is found between 50 and 55%. If we compare these results with the wear resistance (Fig. 11c), it is clear that the best results are not obtained from the hardest samples (i.e. the most resistant to plastic deformation). In fact, a significant improvement is obtained for the samples prepared at ratios above 1, which possess a lubricant phase content beyond 65%. The samples prepared at lower ratios (0.5 and 0) exhibit little or no amorphous lubricant content and their tribological performance is worse despite enhanced hardness properties. It is therefore concluded that the tribological performance is more affected by the predominance of an amorphous lubricant phase than the mechanical properties of the film. These results differ from previous publications, where the correlation between wear resistance and H/E ratios is emphasized [33,40]. This is the likely consequence of the tribological behavior being controlled by the friction-induced phenomena at the contact, as we showed in a recent paper of Raman analysis of the counterfaces [18].
In the last graph (Fig. 11d), it is observed how the values for elastic work show a continuous increase as the content of the amorphous phase does, as it was pointed out in the discussion of Fig. 10c. Interpolating the optimum range for the mechanical properties, we are situated at around 60%, whilst the region giving the best tribological performance corresponds to 70–80% of elastic work. According to the previous data [39,41], this region corresponds to an optimum toughness, as reported by Voevodin et al. as having a pseudoplastic behavior [10].
In summary, if the foreseen application requires low friction and wear rates, it will be necessary to increase the content of the amorphous lubricant above a threshold of 65%. A similar conclusion was obtained for a set of TiC/a-C(H) nanocomposite samples [18]. These samples correspond to film deposition carried out at W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratios of higher than 0.5. It is worth mentioning that these samples represent the transition point between these two regimes, combining good mechanical properties (moderate hardness, optimum resilience and elastic work) with a significant improvement in tribological properties. The proportion between the nanocrystalline and amorphous phases reaches an adequate balance, being close to the maximum in hardness with sufficient lubricant amorphous phase to reasonably reduce the friction and wear. Therefore, it represents a good compromise between both aspects, combining the hard nanocrystalline TiN phase with 50–65% of amorphous a-C(N) matrix that provides lubricity and toughness.

Conclusions:
Nanocomposite coatings combining nanocrystalline Ti–C–N and amorphous carbon-based phases have been prepared by a double magnetron sputtering technique with two different approaches: pure sputtering of separate targets (T series) and reactive sputtering with nitrogen in the gas phase (G series). By controlling the power ratio applied to each target (W
                     C/W
                     Ti(N)), it was possible to prepare coatings with tailored mechanical and tribological properties. The key parameters were the degree of crystallinity of the hard phase and the amorphous phase content within the film. The samples prepared by the sputtering of TiN and graphite targets were consistently better in the tribological and mechanical properties. This behavior was attributed to a higher crystallinity of the TiN or TiC

                      phases. The correlation of the tribo-mechanical properties with the amorphous phase content allowed the establishment of the best composition to achieve tailored properties. An agreement between H/E

                     ∗2 ratios and wear resistance is not found in these self-lubricant nanocomposites. Instead, the tribological performance is rather controlled by the structural characteristics and the phase ratio of the nanocrystalline hard and amorphous lubricant phases. In this sense, searching for optimized mechanical properties (hardness, resilience and elastic work), the optimum composition range is found for 50–55% of amorphous phase. Harder coatings can be obtained by growing a TiN layer with bias conditions, although this is at the expense of an increase in the compressive stress and poor tribological properties. The introduction of a certain amount of amorphous carbon matrix can provide good lubricant properties to the contact, significantly decreasing the friction and the wear rate. To accomplish this goal, the content of this soft carbon-based component should be shifted to 60–65%. Further enrichment in the amorphous carbon phase can help to decrease the friction coefficient and the wear rate, but will have a hardness reduction.

Body:
In recent years, nanocomposite protective films have gained popularity among researchers because of their superior mechanical properties compared to the traditional single-phase films. Superhard nanocomposites based on the combination of various transition metal nitrides have been reported in the last decade, displaying hardness values ranging from 40 to 60GPa, typically with excellent thermal stability (e.g. nc-TiN/a-Si3N4, nc-TiN/a-Si3N4/a- and nc-TiSi2, nc-(Ti1−x
                     Al
                        x
                     )N/a-Si3N4, nc-TiN/TiB2, nc-TiN/BN, etc.) [1–9]. These materials are excellent candidates for protective applications on cutting or drilling tools; however, they exhibit reduced ductility as a consequence of their inhibition of dislocation generation and motion. For tribological applications, other properties, such as low friction, wear resistance, toughness and load capacity, are also needed in order to prevent brittle fracture. In addition, the risk of delamination exists due to the high internal stress levels of the coating, especially under severe conditions. One way to improve the composite toughness is to combine the hard nanocrystalline phase with a soft matrix. This design maintains the crystallite size of the hard phase at the nanometric level (5–20nm) separated by a second soft phase with a thickness in the nanometer range in order to relax the incoherence stress. This configuration presents a large volume of grain boundaries, which restricts the initial crack sizes and helps to deflect and terminate the growing cracks. Also, the presence of an amorphous boundary phase facilitates grain boundary sliding, thereby introducing ductility and preventing fracture under severe loading conditions. If this soft matrix has good tribological properties, we can simultaneously obtain a continuous supply of lubricant at the contact, which increases the tribo-mechanical performance in dry lubricated conditions. These investigations illustrate how the mechanical and tribological properties can be optimized by the appropriate combination of crystallite size, distribution of crystals in the matrix, and phase composition.

One of the most studied nanocomposites is the nc-TiC/a-C(H) system [10–18] after Voevodin reported a fourfold increase in the toughness in comparison with nanocrystalline single-phase TiC [19]. Although comparatively to a lesser extent, other groups have synthesized nanocomposite coatings by replacing the TiC by TiN and TiCN phases inside a lubricant matrix [20–22]. For example, Gilmore mixed TiN with MoS2 to achieve a friction around 0.1 and a hardness of 20GPa. Barshilia et al. described the growth of TiN/a-C nanocomposites by reactive magnetron sputtering of Ti and C targets with a hardness optimum at 17at.% of C.

In the present work, nanocomposite coatings based on the combination of Ti(C,N) phases in a carbonaceous matrix are prepared in two different ways: by reactive sputtering with Ar+N2 plasma of a Ti target or direct sputtering of a TiN target. The carbon concentrations in the films are modified by controlling the power ratio applied to the Ti(N) and graphite targets. Both sets of coatings are investigated in terms of microstructure and phase composition by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction (ED), and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). The tribological and mechanical properties are comparatively evaluated by pin-on-disk and ultramicroindentation tests, in order to obtain information about the relationship between the observed practical performance and the film composition.

Ti(C,N) coatings were prepared on AISI M2 polished steel (H
                     =16GPa), Si (100) and NaCl substrates by co-sputtering of titanium (Goodfellow, 99.99% purity) or titanium nitride (Goodfellow, 99% purity) and graphite (Goodfellow, 99.9995% purity) targets (2″ diameter) in Ar or Ar/N2 discharges. The magnetrons were connected to d.c. (graphite) and r.f. (Ti or TiN) sources, respectively. The pressure of the vacuum chamber was measured before deposition at 6.5×10−4
                     Pa, and was at about 0.75Pa while growing. Two sets of samples were prepared using the Ti target and Ar/N2 (7% N2 in volumetric flow) in the gas phase (samples G) or the TiN target and Ar (samples T) with different powers applied to each magnetron. A hybrid sample (TG) was prepared combining nitrogen in the plasma and TiN target. The substrates were mounted in a rotary sample holder (10rpm) to ensure homogeneity. A negative d.c. bias of 100V was applied to the substrate holder for specific samples. The temperature was found to vary in the range of 150–200°C under the effect of the plasma. No additional heating of the substrates was done.

The sputtering conditions and the chemical compositions determined by EELS and XPS are summarized in Table 1
                     . The denomination of the samples follows the general form G/T-R(b), where the G or T prefix indicates the source employed for the nitrogen introduction (G for gas phase; T for sputtering target), R means the power ratio applied to the magnetron (W
                     C/W
                     Ti(N)), and b denotes bias (when applied). A titanium or titanium nitride underlayer of 200nm in thickness has been previously deposited to enhance the adhesion to the substrates. The film thicknesses varied typically between 0.6 and 1μm. Deposition time of the whole process was 4h.

The TEM, ED and EELS measurements were carried out with a Philips CM200 microscope operating at 200kV and equipped with a parallel detection EELS spectrometer from Gatan (766-2K). For their observation, the films grown on the NaCl substrates were floated off in water and supported on a holey carbon grid. The C, N, O and Ti core-loss edges were recorded in the diffraction mode with a camera length of 470mm. The use of a 2mm spectrometer entrance aperture yielded an energy resolution at the zero-loss peak of 1.4eV. The spectra were recorded for dark current and channel-to-channel gain variation. Low-loss spectra were also recorded with the same illumination area (≈1μm in diameter). Commercial TiN powder and an amorphous a-CN
                        x
                      film [23] were measured under the same conditions as reference compounds. After the subtraction of the background by a standard power-law function, the spectra were deconvoluted for plural scattering with the Fourier-ratio method and normalized to the jump. All of these treatments were performed within the EL/P program (Gatan). For quantification, the sensitivity factors supplied by the software were corrected using the reference compounds.

The XRD measurements were carried out using Cu Kα radiation (1.54Å) in a Siemens D5000 diffractometer at an incidence angle of 1°.

The XPS equipment was a VG-Escalab 210 Spectrometer working in the constant analyzer energy mode with a pass energy of 50eV and non-monochromatic Mg Kα radiation (1253.6eV) as the excitation source. Unless it is clearly stated, the chemical analysis corresponds to the sample surface after exposure to air without prior ion etching process.

The tribological properties of the coatings were evaluated by ball-on-disk friction tests in unlubricated sliding against AISI52100 6-mm steel balls in ambient air at a relative humidity between 40 and 50%. The test parameters were set to 5N of applied load (maximum initial Hertzian contact pressure of 1.12GPa), 10cm/s of linear speed, and 1000m of sliding distance. Normalized wear rates (mm3/Nm) were evaluated from cross-sectional profiles taken across the disk-wear track, after testing by means of stylus profilometry.

The microhardness was measured on coated M2 steel disks with a Fischerscope H100 dynamic microprobe instrument using a conventional Vickers indenter with loads up to 10mN. The maximum load was selected in such a way that the maximum indentation depth did not exceed 10–15% of the coating thickness, in order to avoid the influence of the substrate. The test parameters were fixed to an initial load of 0.4mN up to a maximum load of 10mN, in 40 load steps, with a time between two load steps of 0.5s and a test cycle with loading and unloading. The hardness and reduced Young's modulus were calculated from the load–unload displacement curves by the Fischerscope software.

To calculate the values of stress, the Stoney's equation was employed. The curvature was estimated by measuring 20-mm profiles on coatings deposited over silicon substrates.

The chemical composition of the samples was determined by the quantitative EELS technique and the obtained results are presented in Table 1, together with the sputtering powers used during the deposition. The Ti/N ratio measured by EELS is compared with the Ti/N ratio obtained by the XPS analysis. The samples were not submitted to Ar etching to avoid the alteration of the chemical composition by preferential sputtering. Accordingly, the surfaces are affected by adventitious carbon and oxygen contaminations, and only the Ti/N ratio can be taken into account in comparing the samples. Thus, both series agree that the ratio of Ti/N is close to unity except when N2 gas is present in the sputtering plasma together with the carbon species. The most plausible explanation for this effect is that the N2
                        + ions promote the formation of CN
                           x
                         compounds, as has been observed in many previous papers reporting the synthesis of CN
                           x
                         films [23–25].

Fig. 1
                         shows the chemical composition of the samples obtained by quantitative EELS plotted in a ternary diagram. In respect to the procedure used for the synthesis, the T samples are aligned in a vertical line equidistant from Ti and N (ratio Ti/N≈1), whereas the G samples are situated in a parallel line shifted to the right (ratio Ti/N<1). This influence of the nitrogen used in the sputtering gas is also demonstrated in a special sample (TG0.5), where N2 was employed simultaneously with the TiN target as nitrogen source. The effect of introducing nitrogen in the gas phase is manifested in the horizontal displacement of the chemical composition of the sample T0.5 towards the N region. The G0.5 sample is situated in the same vertical line than TG0.5 but immediately below. This means that the replacement of the TiN target by reactive sputtering of Ti reduces the C in the samples but maintains a constant Ti/N ratio. In both series, the carbon contents increase as the power ratio increases. The samples from the T family can be described as a combination of near-stoichiometric TiN and C. In the G samples, the excess of N might be linked to C in the form of CN
                           x
                        .

The crystalline phases present in the coatings have been evaluated by means of grazing incidence XRD. Fig. 2
                         shows a selected region of the XRD patterns where the peak position for the TiC, TiN and TiC
                           x
                        N
                           y
                         phases are marked. Peaks from metallic Ti and Fe are observed in some cases, due to the underlayers used for improving the adhesion and the M2 steel substrate, respectively. The main peak at 61–62° (2θ angle) is situated in the vicinity of TiN, although its position can be affected by the presence of other Ti(C,N) phases and the residual stress in the coatings. The residual stress, as it is shown later, is only significant for the G0b and T0b samples prepared with bias assistance. In the remaining cases, the shift towards lower angles can be interpreted by the formation of ternary TiC
                           x
                        N
                           y
                         (TiN0.3C0.7 and/or TiN0.7C0.3), whose lattice parameter is between the TiN and TiC phases. This effect is clearly manifested in sample T0.5. The Ti/N ratio measured by XPS for this sample is 1.3, which is indicative of the existence of TiN
                           x
                        C
                           y
                        .

A peak broadening is also observed simultaneously with the increment of the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio, indicating a diminution of the coherent diffraction domains. Higher power ratios promote higher carbon incorporation and therefore a higher proportion of amorphous phases (a-C and a-CN
                           x
                        ). This trend is more evident in the G samples, whose crystallinities are poorer than the T samples, and the formation of amorphous CN
                           x
                         phase by the nitrogen gas used for sputtering is possible. This amorphization trend is demonstrated in Fig. 2c by the comparison of the samples prepared at a ratio of 0.5 in different configurations. An increment of the peak intensity is observed in parallel with the removal of N2 from the gas phase and the employment of the TiN target. These differences can be explained as a result of the higher energy transfer to the N atoms by the non-reactive process. In the case of reactive sputtering, energy is also needed to dissociate the molecular nitrogen gas and the surface diffusivity of the adatoms is reduced by the adsorbed gas atom (N) [26].

Fig. 3
                         shows the TEM micrographs of coatings prepared at a ratio of 0, with and without bias, together with their associated electron diffraction patterns. The film microstructure is rather crystalline in all cases, as can be deduced from the TEM pictures and the presence of well-defined electron diffraction rings. Their associated d-spacings are in agreement with cubic TiN phase. The films are constituted by crystals of irregular shape and size (3–20nm), although the average value is smaller in the G series. The microstructure of the T films appears to be unaffected by the application of substrate bias, while in the case of G sample, the lack of bias leads to a film microstructure formed by very fine grains (below 10nm). Fig. 4
                         denotes the influence of carbon incorporation, with pictures taken of samples deposited at increasing power ratios. The increment of the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) sputtering power ratio led to a more amorphous structure, as denoted by the presence of finer grains (1–10nm) and more diffuse diffraction rings.

In order to investigate the chemical bonding structure, EELS and XPS techniques were applied to these series of nanocomposite coatings. These techniques do not require the long-range order that XRD needs and, thus, information concerning the chemical state of the elements inside the matrix can be obtained.

Fig. 5
                         shows the energy-loss spectra for the samples under study together with several references of pure TiC and TiN powders, and amorphous C and CN
                           x
                         films prepared by magnetron sputtering. In the case of C K-edge and N K-edge, the near-edge fine structure (ELNES) of TiC and TiN is dominated by well-separated strong π and σ peaks of approximately equal intensity situated at 283 and 292eV (TiC) and 395 and 405eV (TiN), respectively [27,28]. On the other side, the references for the amorphous carbon-based compounds are characterized by the existence of a narrow π peak (285eV) and a broad σ peak centered at 295eV. The contribution of the 1s→π* transitions appear more resolved and intense in the CN
                           x
                         compounds than in amorphous C, due to the participation of the lone electron pair of nitrogen in the π bonding states [29]. The comparison of the ELNES spectra obtained for the nanostructured films demonstrates that the carbon nature is essentially amorphous, a-CN
                           x
                         and a-C, except for the T0.5 sample, where the change in shape seems to point out the presence of certain carbide species. The shape of the N K-edge does not change very much among different samples and looks very similar to TiN, although the contribution of N in the amorphous CN
                           x
                         compounds begins to be relevant for the highest ratio. This is particularly the case of the G series in agreement with what was observed by the XPS and the peak broadening by XRD.

XPS analysis was carried out with the aim of obtaining further information on the chemical bonding. Fig. 6
                         depicts the Ti2p, N1s and C1s photoelectron peaks for both series of samples. The Ti2p signals are ordered by increasing power ratio, as this parameter is controlling the Ti incorporation inside the coating. Two components are clearly identified at 458.5eV and 455.5eV, due to the TiO2 and TiN phases. A third component is usually situated in the middle of both peaks due to the oxynitride species (Ti–ON) and/or a satellite shake-up peak [30]. This latter appears more intense in the G series where N2 gas is used as the N-source. By fitting the analysis of Ti 2p3/2, the TiN/TiON area ratios are found to be 0.66 and 1.07 for the G and T series, respectively. Considering that the amount of Ti incorporated in the films is approximately the same for similar ratios in both series, this can be interpreted as a higher concentration of Ti–N bonds in the T samples together with a higher presence of Ti–ON species in the G samples. Three signals are observed in the N1s peak, due to the TiN (∼397.0eV), CN
                           x
                         (∼399.3 and ∼400.8eV) and N–O (∼403.0eV, only in the sample B0b) components [31,32]. In the T series, the major contribution arises from TiN, in agreement with the Ti2p analysis, and its intensity decreases in parallel with the increment of the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio. In this series, the presence of CN
                           x
                         is minimal when compared with the G samples. The content of the CN
                           x
                         species grows with the increment of the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio, with a maximum in the G2 sample (W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N)
                        =2). The main contribution of the C1s appears at 285.2eV, due to C–C bonds, while the shoulder towards the higher energies is attributed to the CN
                           x
                         species [29,32]. Nevertheless, the existence of the adventitious hydrocarbon contamination layer on the surface of the sample makes the deeper study on the C1s peaks difficult. Sample T0.5 exhibits a small contribution at ∼282eV, indicative of carbide bonds [19]. This correlates with the formation of the ternary compound TiN
                           x
                        C
                           y
                        , as suggested by XRD and EELS analyses.

To have a clearer insight on the species present in this particular sample, the XPS spectra after Ar+ ion etching are presented in Fig. 7
                        . The Ti2p, N1s and C1s photoelectron peaks appear deconvoluted into the different components stated previously. The predominance of Ti–N species is demonstrated from the position and intensity of this bonding type in the Ti2p and N1s peaks at 455.5 and 397eV, respectively [30,31]. The removal of carbon adventitious layer allows to distinguish two different contributions in the C1s peak at 282.2 and 284.6eV that can be assigned to C–Ti and C–C bonds. These results make plausible the assumption of ternary TiN
                           x

                           y
                         compound in this sample. As a summary of the chemical information obtained by means of XPS and EELS techniques, Table 2
                         collects the most significant bonding types identified for the analysed coatings.

Fig. 8
                         shows the tribological properties (friction coefficient and wear resistance) for both series of samples. The increment of the sputtering W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio influences the tribological properties, as it controls the microstructure and phase composition of the coatings. The higher the W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio, the lower the friction and wear values, although the G samples always gave worse performance. The friction coefficient exhibits a drastic decrease from 0.6–0.7 to values below 0.3 when combining the sputtering of the Ti(N) target with graphite. This supports that the introduction of amorphous carbon-based phases (a-C and a-CN
                           x
                        ) into the film has occurred, which can play the role of lubricants. The high friction response corresponds, therefore, to a predominance of the hard crystalline TiN phase.

Regarding the wear rate the trends are similar. The coatings exhibit higher wear resistance as the W

                        Ti(N) ratio increases although the improvement in the T series is more noteworthy. This latter can be correlated with the crystallinity of the TiN phase as shown by XRD (cf. Fig. 2). The diffractograms provide evidences of higher crystalline domain sizes for the T series compared to those obtained by reactive sputtering. It is also worthy to consider the higher relative amount of TiN phase versus titanium oxinitride phases detected by XPS for these samples. Although both aspects, microstructure and phase composition, are responsible for the observed tribological behavior, it appears that the friction is mainly controlled by the kind of carbon-based lubricant phase and the wear response by the crystallinity of the hard TiN phase. The sample TG, prepared in hybrid conditions, serves as a good example to illustrate this fact. Its friction coefficient is similar to that of the G series but its wear resistance is closer in value to that of the T films. As it has been shown before, the TG sample exhibits an amorphous phase similar to the G phase (CN
                           x
                        ) but a crystalline phase typical of the T series. The CN
                           x
                         amorphous phase formed inside the Ti–C–N nanocomposites is a less efficient lubricant in comparison with the amorphous C. Besides, the wear resistance is improved if the TiN is introduced by direct sputtering of the TiN target instead of employing reactive sputtering with nitrogen on a Ti target. It is, therefore, clearly inferred that employing nitrogen in the plasma sputtering process yields coatings with worse tribological performance, both in friction and wear rates.

Fig. 9
                         summarizes the Young's moduli, hardness and residual stress values of the different coatings. Again, an improvement is observed in the properties when using the TiN target, with a higher hardness and reduced elastic modulus values resulting. If we do not use bias substrate polarization, the H and E
                        ∗ values vary around 10–20GPa and 90–220GPa, respectively, with compressive stresses below 1.5GPa. However, when bias is applied, the hardness can be improved in both series, particularly for the sample T0b (45GPa), although at the expense of an increase in residual compressive stresses. Nevertheless, it must be highlighted that the improvement in hardness cannot be attributed to the residual stress. Both samples prepared with bias exhibit similar values of stress, but the hardness is significantly higher for the T0b film. In addition to hardness, recent papers emphasized the significance of the elastic strain to failure (related to H/E*), resistance to plastic deformation (related to H
                        3/E
                        ∗2) and fracture toughness (i.e. resistance to crack propagation) on having good tribological performance (particularly in abrasion, impact and erosive wear). The expressions H/E
                        ∗ and H
                        3/E
                        ∗2 (resilience) have often been used to correlate with the wear behavior [33–35], whilst the experimental determination of toughness remains a challenging task in thin films due to their limited thickness and the influence of the substrate [36,37]. By considering the equation of the “critical strain energy release for fast fracture” (G
                        c
                        =
                        πaσ
                        c/E) [37], with a as the length of a pre-existing crack, it is concluded that fracture toughness would also be improved by both a low Young's modulus and a high critical stress for fracture (σ
                        c), which implies the need for a high hardness. Similarly, using the equation for fracture toughness (K
                        IC) measured by the crack length induced by indentation, the equation contains the ratio E/H under the applied indentation load [37]. Therefore, in an attempt to correlate H/E and H
                        3/E
                        ∗2 with toughness and wear behavior, we have calculated them from the measured values of H and E∗ for the coatings deposited under different conditions.

Fig. 10a displays the effective hardness as a function of the Young's modulus for the nanostructured Ti–C–N films investigated in this work and a reference coating of amorphous carbon. A linear relationship between H and E* is noticed for Ti–C–N nanocomposites (prepared at W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratios of 0.5, 1 and 2) as well as the TiN films (W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratio of 0, with or without bias). The calculated H/E
                        ∗ values are displayed in Table 3
                        . They range from 0.08 to 0.1 providing evidence of the possibility of controlling the film hardness as a function of the effective elastic modulus by the choice of the film's chemical composition. In general, a low E
                        ∗ becomes desirable, as it allows the given load to be distributed over a wider area. However, this argument (although valid) is in contradiction to conventional fracture mechanics theory, which predicates a high modulus to prevent crack growth [38].

Fig. 10b illustrates how the resilience H
                        3/E
                        ∗2 increases continuously with H, since the ratio H/E
                        ∗ is approximately constant in any of the two above-mentioned types of coatings. Thus, for each family of samples, it stands that the highest resistance to plastic deformation corresponds to those displaying the highest hardness properties. However, it has been stated that these films did not provide the best tribological performance.

The elastic recovery (W
                        e %) is plotted in Fig. 10c against the estimated H/E
                        ∗ values. This parameter is calculated from the area under the unloading portion of a typical loading/unloading curve. The most important finding that follows is the fact that high elastic recoveries are not necessarily obtained by the hardest films. In a similar way to H/E
                        ∗ and H
                        3/E
                        ∗2, the elastic recoveries are grouped into the same two families. Thus, the highest elastic recoveries (between 60 and 80%) are obtained with the group of samples with carbon (Ti–C–N nanocomposite samples and pure a-C), while the remaining samples (TiN films) gave inferior value, around 40–50%. Among the samples with C, it is observed that the greater incorporation of carbon (higher power ratios) yields higher W
                        e values. Consequently, it can be concluded that it is possible to tailor the elastic recovery properties while maintaining a similar H/E
                        ∗ value by adequately selecting the parameters used for the deposition.

In an attempt to compare these parameters for both groups of samples as a function of the phase composition, an estimation of the amorphous phase was performed. It is assumed that the titanium atoms are predominantly in the form of the TiN compound and that the remaining N is bonded to C as CN
                           x
                        . Otherwise, a simple correlation using the Ti content would not be correct since the nature of the amorphous phases present in both sets of films is not the same. A similar approach has been followed in a recent paper [39]. The expression used is the following:

Fig. 11 illustrates the correlation between the mechanical and tribological properties versus the content of the amorphous carbon (a-C and/or a-CN
                           x
                        ) inside the coatings. Fig. 11a shows that the hardness values exhibit a reduction at around 50–55% of amorphous phase, although lower values are always observed for the G samples when comparing both series in pairs. Fig. 11b plots the dependence of the resistance to plastic deformation H3/E∗2 versus the amorphous phase content. As pointed out previously, high values of H/E and H
                        3/E
                        ∗2 are of interest because they have a good ability to resist cracking during large elastic deformation; however, once this regime is overcome, they exhibit brittle fracture. In a similar way as hardness, a transition point is found between 50 and 55%. If we compare these results with the wear resistance (Fig. 11c), it is clear that the best results are not obtained from the hardest samples (i.e. the most resistant to plastic deformation). In fact, a significant improvement is obtained for the samples prepared at ratios above 1, which possess a lubricant phase content beyond 65%. The samples prepared at lower ratios (0.5 and 0) exhibit little or no amorphous lubricant content and their tribological performance is worse despite enhanced hardness properties. It is therefore concluded that the tribological performance is more affected by the predominance of an amorphous lubricant phase than the mechanical properties of the film. These results differ from previous publications, where the correlation between wear resistance and H/E ratios is emphasized [33,40]. This is the likely consequence of the tribological behavior being controlled by the friction-induced phenomena at the contact, as we showed in a recent paper of Raman analysis of the counterfaces [18].

In the last graph (Fig. 11d), it is observed how the values for elastic work show a continuous increase as the content of the amorphous phase does, as it was pointed out in the discussion of Fig. 10c. Interpolating the optimum range for the mechanical properties, we are situated at around 60%, whilst the region giving the best tribological performance corresponds to 70–80% of elastic work. According to the previous data [39,41], this region corresponds to an optimum toughness, as reported by Voevodin et al. as having a pseudoplastic behavior [10].

In summary, if the foreseen application requires low friction and wear rates, it will be necessary to increase the content of the amorphous lubricant above a threshold of 65%. A similar conclusion was obtained for a set of TiC/a-C(H) nanocomposite samples [18]. These samples correspond to film deposition carried out at W
                        C/W
                        Ti(N) ratios of higher than 0.5. It is worth mentioning that these samples represent the transition point between these two regimes, combining good mechanical properties (moderate hardness, optimum resilience and elastic work) with a significant improvement in tribological properties. The proportion between the nanocrystalline and amorphous phases reaches an adequate balance, being close to the maximum in hardness with sufficient lubricant amorphous phase to reasonably reduce the friction and wear. Therefore, it represents a good compromise between both aspects, combining the hard nanocrystalline TiN phase with 50–65% of amorphous a-C(N) matrix that provides lubricity and toughness.

Nanocomposite coatings combining nanocrystalline Ti–C–N and amorphous carbon-based phases have been prepared by a double magnetron sputtering technique with two different approaches: pure sputtering of separate targets (T series) and reactive sputtering with nitrogen in the gas phase (G series). By controlling the power ratio applied to each target (W
                     C/W
                     Ti(N)), it was possible to prepare coatings with tailored mechanical and tribological properties. The key parameters were the degree of crystallinity of the hard phase and the amorphous phase content within the film. The samples prepared by the sputtering of TiN and graphite targets were consistently better in the tribological and mechanical properties. This behavior was attributed to a higher crystallinity of the TiN or TiC

                      phases and the better lubricant properties of an a-C matrix than the a-CN
                        x
                      phases. The correlation of the tribo-mechanical properties with the amorphous phase content allowed the establishment of the best composition to achieve tailored properties. An agreement between H/E
                     ∗, H
                     3/E
                     ∗2 ratios and wear resistance is not found in these self-lubricant nanocomposites. Instead, the tribological performance is rather controlled by the structural characteristics and the phase ratio of the nanocrystalline hard and amorphous lubricant phases. In this sense, searching for optimized mechanical properties (hardness, resilience and elastic work), the optimum composition range is found for 50–55% of amorphous phase. Harder coatings can be obtained by growing a TiN layer with bias conditions, although this is at the expense of an increase in the compressive stress and poor tribological properties. The introduction of a certain amount of amorphous carbon matrix can provide good lubricant properties to the contact, significantly decreasing the friction and the wear rate. To accomplish this goal, the content of this soft carbon-based component should be shifted to 60–65%. Further enrichment in the amorphous carbon phase can help to decrease the friction coefficient and the wear rate, but will have a hardness reduction.

Influence of addition of different concentrations of aluminum and chromium in LiGe2(PO4)3 glass-ceramic was investigated.

The glass–ceramics were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Complex Impedance Spectroscopy (CIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The highest lithium ion conductivity of 6.65×10−3

Introduction:
Safety and high power density are two important challenges in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) production industry. Common LIBs contain organic flammable solvents (such as ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate and ethyl methyl carbonate) and are not appropriate for specific use of transportation industry because charge and discharge processes of batteries in hybrid and electrical vehicles are in high current rate that it can cause explosion in these batteries [1]. Moreover, fabrication costs of batteries, when using organic electrolytes are high. These drawbacks limit their application in large-scale batteries, which require low cost, high safety, and high power density [2]. Recently, aqueous and solid electrolytes as safe, environmentally friendly and cheap electrolytes have been investigated by different researchers [3–6]. All-solid-state and aqueous lithium-air batteries are two new types of LIBs which use these electrolyte and are recently investigated by researchers for safety and power density improvement respectively without common problems of organic solvents. Both of these batteries need solid lithium ion conductors as electrolytes or anode protector [7,8]. Solid electrolytes that are used in these types of batteries must have some properties such as low electron conduction (electronic conductivity), high lithium ion conduction and electrochemical stability in contact with anode and cathode or wide potential window [9–12]. Moreover, these solid electrolytes or lithium ion conductors must have other properties except those that were mentioned above such as stability in contact with lithium metal and no permeability for water and air molecules when used for lithium-air batteries [13]. Perovskite-type, Garnet-type, NASICON-type and LISICON are four main crystalline inorganic lithium ion conductors [14]. NASICON-type has general formula of LiM2(PO4)3 where M can be Ti4+ or Ge4+. Crystals with Ti4+ are unstable in contact with lithium metal because of reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+. Only Ge4+ can make a crystalline structure with high lithium ion conduction and all properties that were mentioned above [15–18].

                     ) which has appropriate channels for Li ions (Li+) migration. In this crystal, two types of polyhedrons contain: GeO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra which are attached by their corners to form [Ge(PO4)]− frame with 3D interconnected channels and two types of interstitial cavities, A1 and A2. Li ions migrate in channels of this frame [19]. Li ions can occupy in A1 and A2 sites. In LiGe2(PO4)3 with no dopant, A2 sites are vacant when A1 sites are occupied by Li ions. Partial substitution of Ge4+ ions by trivalent cations such as Al3+ and Cr3+ ions increases the unit cell dimensions and residual negative charges are neutralized by additional Li ion that occupy A2 sites. The change in unit cell dimensions and Li ion concentration in crystal leads to increase of ionic conductivity [19–23].
The effect of Al as dopant on ionic conductivity of LiGe2(PO4)3 (LGP) was investigated by researchers and it was proved that highest lithium ion conductivity is obtained when only 25% of Ge4+ ions were replaced by Al3+ ions in LiGe2(PO4)3 crystal structure (x=0.5 in overall formula of Li1

                     xAlxGe2−x(PO4)3) [24,25]. Other researchers investigated the effect of chromium dopant on lithium conduction improvement of LiGe2(PO4)3 
                     [26,27]. Recently, chromium and aluminum co-doped NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) were synthesized by Zhang et al. and simultaneous replacement of Ti4+ ions by aluminum and chromium ions showed good improvement on ionic conduction of LTP glass–ceramics [28].
The NASICON-type lithium ion conductors were prepared by powder sintering route [29,30], Sol–gel method [13,31,32] and glass–ceramic process (melt quenching) [33–35]. Glass–ceramic method produces homogeneous microstructure without porosity with high Li+ ion conductivity which is better for lithium-air batteries. Therefore, in this research the last method was applied for preparation of lithium ion conductors.
In this research for the first time, the influence of addition of aluminum and chromium as dopants on crystal structure and ionic conductivity of LiGe2(PO4)3 NASICON-type glass–ceramics were investigated simultaneously. In this new glass–ceramics (Li1

These five samples with y=0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4 and 0.5 are labeled as #Cr0, Cr0.1, Cr0.25, Cr0.4 and Cr0.5, respectively. In addition crystallization process is an important phenomenon that affects ionic conductivity strongly and recently the effects of crystallization time and temperature have been studied by authors in another work for achievement of maximum ionic conduction in Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass–ceramics (under review). These optimum conditions were used for crystallization of synthesized aluminum and chromium co-doped NASICON-type LiGe2(PO4)3.

Then they were heated in electrical furnace at 700°C for 2h in order to release ammonia, carbon dioxide and water vapor compounds. Then, the puff shape materials were crushed in agate mortar and pestle and were transformed in platinum crucible and heated in electrical furnace at 1450°C for 1h. The homogeneous melted glass was pressed and quenched by two preheated (300°C) stainless steel plates. The transparent thin glass disks were transferred to another furnace and were annealed at 500°C for 2h to release the thermal stresses. Then, the annealed thin disks were cut to ~1×1cm specimens and were crystallized at 850°C for 8h.

Results and discussion:
Fig. 1
                      shows the crystallization temperature (TC) graph of fine glass powder for Cr0, Cr0.1, Cr0.25, Cr0.4 and Cr0.5 (heating rate of 5°C/min). As seen in the figure, increasing the chromium concentration increases the TC (Comparison between Cr0 and Cr0.5) but for specimen with no aluminum (Cr0.5), TC is increased sharply and is around 787°C. The glass transition and strong exothermic crystallization peak are appeared at around 533 and 628°C, respectively for specimen with no chromium dopant (Cr0). Crystallization at temperature above the TC ensures the perfect and homogeneous crystallization [34].
Fig. 2
                      shows the XRD patterns of specimens crystallized at 850°C for 8h. In all samples, the main peaks are related to NASICON-type structure LiGe2(PO4)3 space group (

                     ) according to JCPDS 80-1924 index file. There is no Al3+ or Cr3+ ions in LiGe2(PO4)3 structure but the aluminum and chromium make a solid solution with this structure and Ge4+ ions were partially replaced by Al3+ and Cr3+ ions because the radii of these ions are close to each other [20] (Ge4+
                     =0.53A°, Al3+
                     =0.54A° and Cr3+
                     =0.61A°) solid solution forms and NASICON-type was retained as main phase in XRD pattern. Moreover these substitutions induce more lithium ions in NASICON-type structure in A2 vacant sites and increase the cell volume. Increasing the chromium concentration in crystal structure leads to forming secondary CrPO4 phase in grain boundary during the crystallization process that it prevents from lithium ions migration between grains. Only in XRD pattern of Cr0.1 sample, peaks are related to LiGe2(PO4)3 structure with no CrPO4 phase and minimum peak intensity of GeO2. Addition of more chromium in crystal structure leads to formation of higher CrPO4 and GeO2 in grain boundaries. Diffraction peaks due to CrPO4 and GeO2 phases in the XRD pattern of Cr0.5 show highest intensity among other specimens.
As mentioned above, the ionic radii of Al3+, Cr3+ and Ge4+ are close to each other and it leads to partial substitution of Ge4+ by these ions and formation of a solid solution with NASICON-type structure as main phase but slight difference between radii of these ions changes the crystal cell parameters with changing the composition. Fig. 3a and b show lattice parameters (a and c axis) dependence to initial stoichiometry calculated by XRD data and UnitCell software. By increasing of Cr3+ in crystal structure, these parameters increase because of higher ionic radii of Cr3+ rather than Al3+ and these increments in cell axis, increase the cell volume. This expansion is beneficial for lithium ions migration but according to XRD patterns higher addition of Cr3+ in crystals, leads to secondary phases (or nonconductive phases) formation in grain boundaries which is not beneficial for lithium ions conduction.
Fig. 4
                      reveals fractured surfaces observed by FESEM for microstructure investigation of C0.25 glass and Cr0 to Cr0.5 glass–ceramics. Fig. 4a is related to Cr0.25 glass (amorphous) specimen that was only annealed at 500°C (<Tg) for thermal stresses release. There was no crystal or grain that is an effect of fast cooling the melt and this homogenous and dense structure with no pore are the properties which are obtained by melt-quenching method. In all samples (except 4a) regular and large crystals with lesser grain boundaries and cubic shape were appeared. In Fig. 4b, secondary phases were not visible for Cr0 specimen in grain boundaries but related XRD pattern showed slight peaks of GeO2. In Fig. 4c, there was no secondary phase in Cr0.1 sample and it was in accordance to XRD pattern of Cr0.1. Both of these figures show tight contact and compactness between grains with average size of 2–3μm for grains. Fig. 4d, e and f, reveal developed crystals and GeO2 or CrPO4 phases formed in grain boundaries for Cr0.25, Cr0.4 and Cr0.5, respectively and more evident for Cr0.5 specimen. Observation of these phases in grain boundaries is completely in accordance to XRD data of Cr0.25, Cr0.4 and Cr0.5. These secondary phases prevent from lithium ions migration between grains in other words these phases have blocking effect and decrease the ionic conductivity. Phase elemental analysis of specimens by EDX illustrated composition of the grain and secondary phases formed in grain boundaries.
Fig. 5
                      shows EDX elemental analysis of glass and crystallized specimens. Analysis of different points or surface on grains (shaped crystals) has good agreement with initial stoichiometry of Li1.5AlxCryGe2−x−y(PO4)3 for each specimen. But for Cr0.25, Cr0.4 and Cr0.5 specimens, analysis for specified points in grain boundaries reveals formation of GeO2 or CrPO4 or mix of them. EDX cannot calculate the wt% of Li and other alkali metals, but Li has only less than 2.5wt% in overall formula of Li1.5AlxCryGe2−x−y(PO4)3 which does not have significant effect on analysis of other elements of specimens. Table 1
                      shows elemental analysis of specified points or surface on Fig. 5. These results confirm the cause of GeO2 and CrPO4 peaks appearance in XRD patterns. According to obtained results analysis on grain surfaces in Fig. 5b, c and d is related to C0, Cr0.1 and C0.25, respectively and analysis on secondary phases formed in grain boundary in Fig. 5e, f and g is related to GeO2, an unknown phase similar to 1mol GeO2
                     +2mol CrPO4 and CrPO4 respectively.
Complex impedance spectroscopy for glass–ceramics has two semicircles (one at high frequency related to bulk resistance and another at mid frequency related to grain boundary resistance) and a linear Warburg-type impedance correspond to ionic conductive materials with blocking electrode but around room temperature because of high ionic conductivity of grain and limitation of frequency range of the apparatus only one semicircle was appeared in the plots of samples. The total (Rb
                     +Rgb) and the bulk resistance (Rb) of the samples were obtained from the right and left intercepts of this semicircle with the real axis in the plots, respectively. The value of the grain boundary resistance (Rgb) was simply the difference between (Rb
                     +Rgb) and Rb 
                     [27,35–40]. These fitting and calculation of semicircles diameters were done by using the FRA (Frequency Response Analyzer) software. After polishing and painting the silver on both sides, specimens were placed between two blocking electrodes in cell fixture and Rb, Rgb and Rt were calculated from impedance data in frequency range of 1–106
                     Hz. Ionic conductivity (bulk, grain boundary and total conductivity) was calculated from Eq. (1):

                     where R, S and d are resistance (bulk or grain boundary or total resistance), painted surface and thickness of specimen respectively [29]. Fig. 6a and b shows complex impedance profile measured at −20°C for Cr0.1 specimen and complex impedance profiles at 26°C for Cr0, Cr0.1, Cr0.25, Cr0.4 and Cr0.5 specimens, crystallized at 850°C for 8h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6a two depressed semicircles attributed to bulk and grain boundary were appeared in impedance profile at low temperature but at room temperature only one semicircle attributed to grain boundary was appeared as shown in Fig. 6b. Also, addition of chromium into crystal structure up to 0.1 in overall formula decreases the total resistance of specimen. This specimen also showed lowest grain boundary resistance. But more increase in chromium concentration increased the grain boundary resistance because of GeO2 and CrPO4 formation in grain boundaries which has blocking effect and prevents from easy lithium ions migration from one grain to another. XRD patterns and EDX analysis showed these impure phases in grain boundaries for Cr0.25, Cr0.4 and Cr0.5 specimens.

Activation energy of lithium ion migration in NASICON-type crystal phase was calculated by measuring of conductivity of each specimen at different temperatures and fitting of these data by Arrhenius equation.

Fig. 9
                      shows the temperature dependence of the conductivity of Cr0.1 specimen in temperature range of 20–60°C. The data in the figure are found to be linear with correlation factor of 0.998, and data well fit the Arrhenius equation. The linearity demonstrates that there was no phase or structure change for specimen in the testing temperature range. Activation energy for this specimen with highest ionic conductivity in room temperature was obtained 0.292eV from slop of this figure.
Activation energy for specimen with different amount of aluminum and chromium crystallized at 850°C for 8h was calculated by above method and is shown in Fig. 10
                     . By comparison of this figure with Fig. 7, the Cr0.1 specimen with maximum conductivity of 6.65×10−3
                     S/cm showed minimum activation energy of 0.292eV.

No other reactions are observed in the potential range up to 7V versus Li/Li+, indicating stability of this specimen in contact with lithium metal foil and a wide stability window for Li1.5Al0.4Cr0.1Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass–ceramics.
When lithium ions pass from LAGP 3D network some phenomena such as secondary phase formation in grain boundaries or microcracks formation in grain and grain boundaries makes a tortuous path for lithium ions migration and therefore leads to decreasing the ionic conductivity the specimen with highest ionic conductivity showed minimum activation energy. Activation energy is a key factor in modeling and calculation of ionic conductivity for a specific temperature in battery experiments. Table 3
                      compares ionic conductivity and activation energy for two main groups of NASICON-type glass–ceramics. Some of Titanium based (Crystals with TiO6 octahedra group) crystals have good ionic conductibility but they are not stable in contact with lithium metal and in case of lithium-air batteries these conductors are not appropriate. Therefore, research on LiGe2(PO4)3 group for synthesis of new compound or optimization of crystallization condition are necessary. As mentioned in introduction section these crystals are stable in contact with lithium metal and water solution and also have good lithium ion conductivity and low electronic conductivity.

Conclusions:
NASICON-type glass–ceramics with addition of aluminum and chromium dopants as a novel fast lithium ion conductor were synthesized by conventional melt-quenching method and crystallized in optimum crystallization time and temperature. In overall formula of Li1

On one hand, it increases the cell parameter which improves conductivity and on the other hand formation of secondary phases in grain boundaries which decreases the conductivity. Formation of these phases was observed in XRD patterns and FESEM images and also was proved by EDX analysis. Measuring the ionic conductivity of samples in 26°C by complex impedance spectroscopy showed the maximum lithium ion conduction of 6.65×10−3
                     S/cm obtained for Li1.5Al0.4Cr0.1Ge1.5(PO4)3 sample. Measuring the conductivity for each sample in temperature range of 20 to 60°C for calculation of activation energy by Arrhenius equation showed minimum activation energy for Li1.5Al0.4Cr0.1Ge1.5(PO4)3 sample about 0.292 eV with highest ionic conductivity. Also, the cyclic voltammetry of this specimen showed good stability in contact with lithium foil.

Body:
Safety and high power density are two important challenges in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) production industry. Common LIBs contain organic flammable solvents (such as ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate and ethyl methyl carbonate) and are not appropriate for specific use of transportation industry because charge and discharge processes of batteries in hybrid and electrical vehicles are in high current rate that it can cause explosion in these batteries [1]. Moreover, fabrication costs of batteries, when using organic electrolytes are high. These drawbacks limit their application in large-scale batteries, which require low cost, high safety, and high power density [2]. Recently, aqueous and solid electrolytes as safe, environmentally friendly and cheap electrolytes have been investigated by different researchers [3–6]. All-solid-state and aqueous lithium-air batteries are two new types of LIBs which use these electrolyte and are recently investigated by researchers for safety and power density improvement respectively without common problems of organic solvents. Both of these batteries need solid lithium ion conductors as electrolytes or anode protector [7,8]. Solid electrolytes that are used in these types of batteries must have some properties such as low electron conduction (electronic conductivity), high lithium ion conduction and electrochemical stability in contact with anode and cathode or wide potential window [9–12]. Moreover, these solid electrolytes or lithium ion conductors must have other properties except those that were mentioned above such as stability in contact with lithium metal and no permeability for water and air molecules when used for lithium-air batteries [13]. Perovskite-type, Garnet-type, NASICON-type and LISICON are four main crystalline inorganic lithium ion conductors [14]. NASICON-type has general formula of LiM2(PO4)3 where M can be Ti4+ or Ge4+. Crystals with Ti4+ are unstable in contact with lithium metal because of reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+. Only Ge4+ can make a crystalline structure with high lithium ion conduction and all properties that were mentioned above [15–18]. LiGe2(PO4)3 NASICON-type crystallizes in 3D network structure (rhombohedral crystal system, space group

                        c
                     ) which has appropriate channels for Li ions (Li+) migration. In this crystal, two types of polyhedrons contain: GeO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra which are attached by their corners to form [Ge(PO4)]− frame with 3D interconnected channels and two types of interstitial cavities, A1 and A2. Li ions migrate in channels of this frame [19]. Li ions can occupy in A1 and A2 sites. In LiGe2(PO4)3 with no dopant, A2 sites are vacant when A1 sites are occupied by Li ions. Partial substitution of Ge4+ ions by trivalent cations such as Al3+ and Cr3+ ions increases the unit cell dimensions and residual negative charges are neutralized by additional Li ion that occupy A2 sites. The change in unit cell dimensions and Li ion concentration in crystal leads to increase of ionic conductivity [19–23].

The effect of Al as dopant on ionic conductivity of LiGe2(PO4)3 (LGP) was investigated by researchers and it was proved that highest lithium ion conductivity is obtained when only 25% of Ge4+ ions were replaced by Al3+ ions in LiGe2(PO4)3 crystal structure (x=0.5 in overall formula of Li1

                     xAlxGe2−x(PO4)3) [24,25]. Other researchers investigated the effect of chromium dopant on lithium conduction improvement of LiGe2(PO4)3 
                     [26,27]. Recently, chromium and aluminum co-doped NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) were synthesized by Zhang et al. and simultaneous replacement of Ti4+ ions by aluminum and chromium ions showed good improvement on ionic conduction of LTP glass–ceramics [28].

The NASICON-type lithium ion conductors were prepared by powder sintering route [29,30], Sol–gel method [13,31,32] and glass–ceramic process (melt quenching) [33–35]. Glass–ceramic method produces homogeneous microstructure without porosity with high Li+ ion conductivity which is better for lithium-air batteries. Therefore, in this research the last method was applied for preparation of lithium ion conductors.

In this research for the first time, the influence of addition of aluminum and chromium as dopants on crystal structure and ionic conductivity of LiGe2(PO4)3 NASICON-type glass–ceramics were investigated simultaneously. In this new glass–ceramics (Li1

These five samples with y=0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4 and 0.5 are labeled as #Cr0, Cr0.1, Cr0.25, Cr0.4 and Cr0.5, respectively. In addition crystallization process is an important phenomenon that affects ionic conductivity strongly and recently the effects of crystallization time and temperature have been studied by authors in another work for achievement of maximum ionic conduction in Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass–ceramics (under review). These optimum conditions were used for crystallization of synthesized aluminum and chromium co-doped NASICON-type LiGe2(PO4)3.

The stoichiometric amounts of Germanium dioxide GeO2 (Merck), Lithium carbonate Li2CO3 (Merck), Aluminum oxide Al2O3 (Sigma Aldrich), Chromium(III) oxide Cr2O3 (Merck) and Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4)H2PO4 (Merck) were weighted and mixed for 20min in agate mortar and pestle to prepare (Li1

Then they were heated in electrical furnace at 700°C for 2h in order to release ammonia, carbon dioxide and water vapor compounds. Then, the puff shape materials were crushed in agate mortar and pestle and were transformed in platinum crucible and heated in electrical furnace at 1450°C for 1h. The homogeneous melted glass was pressed and quenched by two preheated (300°C) stainless steel plates. The transparent thin glass disks were transferred to another furnace and were annealed at 500°C for 2h to release the thermal stresses. Then, the annealed thin disks were cut to ~1×1cm specimens and were crystallized at 850°C for 8h.

Thermal behavior of the glass (glass transition temperature Tg and crystallization temperature TC) was analyzed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC, NETZSCH 404 F1 Pegasus-High Temperature DSC, Germany) on the fine powdered glass and heating rate of 5°C/min. Determination of phase formation during heat treatment process were done by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Xmd300 Unisantis, Germany) using Cu Kα radiation in 2θ range from 0 to 70°. Crystallized specimens were fractured and microstructure of glass–ceramics specimens were investigated from fractured section by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM, Sigma-vp Zeiss, Germany), elemental analysis of phases were done by Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), ionic conductivity of polished and silver painted specimens were determined using Complex Impedance Spectroscopy (CIS, Metrohm Autolab PGST302, Netherlands) in frequency range of 1–106
                        Hz. Furthermore, electrochemical stability of specimens in contact with lithium metal foil for corrosion investigation was determined using cyclic voltammetry method (CV, Metrohm Autolab PGST302, Netherlands) at scanning rate of 0.5mV/s between −0.6 and 7V. silver paint and lithium foil on specimen faces, were counter and working electrodes, respectively. The test was done in argon filled glovebox.

As seen in the figure, increasing the chromium concentration increases the TC (Comparison between Cr0 and Cr0.5) but for specimen with no aluminum (Cr0.5), TC is increased sharply and is around 787°C. The glass transition and strong exothermic crystallization peak are appeared at around 533 and 628°C, respectively for specimen with no chromium dopant (Cr0). Crystallization at temperature above the TC ensures the perfect and homogeneous crystallization [34].

                      shows the XRD patterns of specimens crystallized at 850°C for 8h. In all samples, the main peaks are related to NASICON-type structure LiGe2(PO4)3 space group (

                     ) according to JCPDS 80-1924 index file. There is no Al3+ or Cr3+ ions in LiGe2(PO4)3 structure but the aluminum and chromium make a solid solution with this structure and Ge4+ ions were partially replaced by Al3+ and Cr3+ ions because the radii of these ions are close to each other [20] (Ge4+
                     =0.53A°, Al3+
                     =0.54A° and Cr3+
                     =0.61A°) solid solution forms and NASICON-type was retained as main phase in XRD pattern. Moreover these substitutions induce more lithium ions in NASICON-type structure in A2 vacant sites and increase the cell volume. Increasing the chromium concentration in crystal structure leads to forming secondary CrPO4 phase in grain boundary during the crystallization process that it prevents from lithium ions migration between grains. Only in XRD pattern of Cr0.1 sample, peaks are related to LiGe2(PO4)3 structure with no CrPO4 phase and minimum peak intensity of GeO2. Addition of more chromium in crystal structure leads to formation of higher CrPO4 and GeO2 in grain boundaries. Diffraction peaks due to CrPO4 and GeO2 phases in the XRD pattern of Cr0.5 show highest intensity among other specimens.

As mentioned above, the ionic radii of Al3+, Cr3+ and Ge4+ are close to each other and it leads to partial substitution of Ge4+ by these ions and formation of a solid solution with NASICON-type structure as main phase but slight difference between radii of these ions changes the crystal cell parameters with changing the composition. Fig. 3a and b show lattice parameters (a and c axis) dependence to initial stoichiometry calculated by XRD data and UnitCell software. By increasing of Cr3+ in crystal structure, these parameters increase because of higher ionic radii of Cr3+ rather than Al3+ and these increments in cell axis, increase the cell volume. This expansion is beneficial for lithium ions migration but according to XRD patterns higher addition of Cr3+ in crystals, leads to secondary phases (or nonconductive phases) formation in grain boundaries which is not beneficial for lithium ions conduction.

                      reveals fractured surfaces observed by FESEM for microstructure investigation of C0.25 glass and Cr0 to Cr0.5 glass–ceramics. Fig. 4a is related to Cr0.25 glass (amorphous) specimen that was only annealed at 500°C (<Tg) for thermal stresses release. There was no crystal or grain that is an effect of fast cooling the melt and this homogenous and dense structure with no pore are the properties which are obtained by melt-quenching method. In all samples (except 4a) regular and large crystals with lesser grain boundaries and cubic shape were appeared. In Fig. 4b, secondary phases were not visible for Cr0 specimen in grain boundaries but related XRD pattern showed slight peaks of GeO2. In Fig. 4c, there was no secondary phase in Cr0.1 sample and it was in accordance to XRD pattern of Cr0.1. Both of these figures show tight contact and compactness between grains with average size of 2–3μm for grains. Fig. 4d, e and f, reveal developed crystals and GeO2 or CrPO4 phases formed in grain boundaries for Cr0.25, Cr0.4 and Cr0.5, respectively and more evident for Cr0.5 specimen. Observation of these phases in grain boundaries is completely in accordance to XRD data of Cr0.25, Cr0.4 and Cr0.5. These secondary phases prevent from lithium ions migration between grains in other words these phases have blocking effect and decrease the ionic conductivity. Phase elemental analysis of specimens by EDX illustrated composition of the grain and secondary phases formed in grain boundaries.

Fig. 5
                      shows EDX elemental analysis of glass and crystallized specimens. Analysis of different points or surface on grains (shaped crystals) has good agreement with initial stoichiometry of Li1.5AlxCryGe2−x−y(PO4)3 for each specimen. But for Cr0.25, Cr0.4 and Cr0.5 specimens, analysis for specified points in grain boundaries reveals formation of GeO2 or CrPO4 or mix of them. EDX cannot calculate the wt% of Li and other alkali metals, but Li has only less than 2.5wt% in overall formula of Li1.5AlxCryGe2−x−y(PO4)3 which does not have significant effect on analysis of other elements of specimens. Table 1
                      shows elemental analysis of specified points or surface on Fig. 5. These results confirm the cause of GeO2 and CrPO4 peaks appearance in XRD patterns. According to obtained results analysis on grain surfaces in Fig. 5b, c and d is related to C0, Cr0.1 and C0.25, respectively and analysis on secondary phases formed in grain boundary in Fig. 5e, f and g is related to GeO2, an unknown phase similar to 1mol GeO2
                     +2mol CrPO4 and CrPO4 respectively.

Complex impedance spectroscopy for glass–ceramics has two semicircles (one at high frequency related to bulk resistance and another at mid frequency related to grain boundary resistance) and a linear Warburg-type impedance correspond to ionic conductive materials with blocking electrode but around room temperature because of high ionic conductivity of grain and limitation of frequency range of the apparatus only one semicircle was appeared in the plots of samples. The total (Rb
                     +Rgb) and the bulk resistance (Rb) of the samples were obtained from the right and left intercepts of this semicircle with the real axis in the plots, respectively. The value of the grain boundary resistance (Rgb) was simply the difference between (Rb
                     +Rgb) and Rb 
                     [27,35–40]. These fitting and calculation of semicircles diameters were done by using the FRA (Frequency Response Analyzer) software. After polishing and painting the silver on both sides, specimens were placed between two blocking electrodes in cell fixture and Rb, Rgb and Rt were calculated from impedance data in frequency range of 1–106
                     Hz. Ionic conductivity (bulk, grain boundary and total conductivity) was calculated from Eq. (1):

                     where R, S and d are resistance (bulk or grain boundary or total resistance), painted surface and thickness of specimen respectively [29]. Fig. 6a and b shows complex impedance profile measured at −20°C for Cr0.1 specimen and complex impedance profiles at 26°C for Cr0, Cr0.1, Cr0.25, Cr0.4 and Cr0.5 specimens, crystallized at 850°C for 8h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6a two depressed semicircles attributed to bulk and grain boundary were appeared in impedance profile at low temperature but at room temperature only one semicircle attributed to grain boundary was appeared as shown in Fig. 6b. Also, addition of chromium into crystal structure up to 0.1 in overall formula decreases the total resistance of specimen. This specimen also showed lowest grain boundary resistance. But more increase in chromium concentration increased the grain boundary resistance because of GeO2 and CrPO4 formation in grain boundaries which has blocking effect and prevents from easy lithium ions migration from one grain to another. XRD patterns and EDX analysis showed these impure phases in grain boundaries for Cr0.25, Cr0.4 and Cr0.5 specimens.

                     . These data were calculated from specimen dimension and bulk, grain boundary and total resistance extracted from impedance profile by use of Eq. (1). Highest total conductivity was obtained for Cr0.1 crystallized at 850°C for 8h as shown in Fig. 7.

Activation energy of lithium ion migration in NASICON-type crystal phase was calculated by measuring of conductivity of each specimen at different temperatures and fitting of these data by Arrhenius equation.

                      shows complex impedance spectroscopy profile for Cr0.1 specimen measured in temperature range of 20–60°C.

Fig. 9
                      shows the temperature dependence of the conductivity of Cr0.1 specimen in temperature range of 20–60°C. The data in the figure are found to be linear with correlation factor of 0.998, and data well fit the Arrhenius equation. The linearity demonstrates that there was no phase or structure change for specimen in the testing temperature range. Activation energy for this specimen with highest ionic conductivity in room temperature was obtained 0.292eV from slop of this figure.

Activation energy for specimen with different amount of aluminum and chromium crystallized at 850°C for 8h was calculated by above method and is shown in Fig. 10
                     . By comparison of this figure with Fig. 7, the Cr0.1 specimen with maximum conductivity of 6.65×10−3
                     S/cm showed minimum activation energy of 0.292eV.

                     +e→Li) and dissolution (Li→Li+
                     +e) are observed in the potential range from −0.53 to 0.44V versus Li/Li+. No other reactions are observed in the potential range up to 7V versus Li/Li+, indicating stability of this specimen in contact with lithium metal foil and a wide stability window for Li1.5Al0.4Cr0.1Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass–ceramics.

When lithium ions pass from LAGP 3D network some phenomena such as secondary phase formation in grain boundaries or microcracks formation in grain and grain boundaries makes a tortuous path for lithium ions migration and therefore leads to decreasing the ionic conductivity the specimen with highest ionic conductivity showed minimum activation energy. Activation energy is a key factor in modeling and calculation of ionic conductivity for a specific temperature in battery experiments. Table 3
                      compares ionic conductivity and activation energy for two main groups of NASICON-type glass–ceramics. Some of Titanium based (Crystals with TiO6 octahedra group) crystals have good ionic conductibility but they are not stable in contact with lithium metal and in case of lithium-air batteries these conductors are not appropriate. Therefore, research on LiGe2(PO4)3 group for synthesis of new compound or optimization of crystallization condition are necessary. As mentioned in introduction section these crystals are stable in contact with lithium metal and water solution and also have good lithium ion conductivity and low electronic conductivity.

NASICON-type glass–ceramics with addition of aluminum and chromium dopants as a novel fast lithium ion conductor were synthesized by conventional melt-quenching method and crystallized in optimum crystallization time and temperature. In overall formula of Li1

                     yAlxCryGe2−x−y(PO4)3, addition of chromium increased the crystal cell dimension but addition of more than y=0.1 leads to formation of GeO2 and CrPO4 impure phases in grain boundaries which has blocking effect and prevents from lithium ion migration in other words chromium addition has dual effect on the ionic conductivity of LiGe2(PO4)3 glass-ceramic. On one hand, it increases the cell parameter which improves conductivity and on the other hand formation of secondary phases in grain boundaries which decreases the conductivity. Formation of these phases was observed in XRD patterns and FESEM images and also was proved by EDX analysis. Measuring the ionic conductivity of samples in 26°C by complex impedance spectroscopy showed the maximum lithium ion conduction of 6.65×10−3
                     S/cm obtained for Li1.5Al0.4Cr0.1Ge1.5(PO4)3 sample. Measuring the conductivity for each sample in temperature range of 20 to 60°C for calculation of activation energy by Arrhenius equation showed minimum activation energy for Li1.5Al0.4Cr0.1Ge1.5(PO4)3 sample about 0.292 eV with highest ionic conductivity. Also, the cyclic voltammetry of this specimen showed good stability in contact with lithium foil.

Title:
Effect of Calcium on Nd:GdVO

Abstract:
The Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal and Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals were grown by the Czochralski method; the lattice parameters of the crystals were determined by XRD. The results showed that substituting Nd3+ caused an increase in lattice parameter; the segregation coefficient of Nd3+ ions in the crystal is lower than that of Nd:GdVO4 crystal; the absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra, absorption cross-section and the emission cross-section of the Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal were investigated at room temperature; furthermore, the Raman performance of Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal was improved.

Introduction:
Laser diode pumped solid-state lasers have a variety of applications such as in militaries, industries, medical treatments, and scientific research, due to their high level of stability, compactness, efficiency, and longevity. The Nd:GdVO4 crystal has excellent laser properties in high-power laser systems. It is better than that of Nd:YVO4. Many laser experiments have shown that Nd:GdVO4 crystal is an efficient LD pumped solid-state laser crystal [1–6]. However, the intensity of Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) is quite weak for the GdVO4 crystal. In order to improve its Raman performance, the Ca-doped GdVO4 crystals have been grown and investigated in our laboratory. This paper deals with the effect of Calcium on Nd:GdVO4 single crystal.

                     Materials synthesis
                     The raw material, GdVO4, was prepared by liquid-phase reaction. At first, NH4VO3 (≥99% analytically pure) powder was dissolved in the heated distilled water, and then filtrated to clarify the solution. Secondly, Gd2O3 (≥99.999% spectroscopic pure) powder was dissolved in the heated dilute nitric acid. Finally, the solutions of NH4VO3 and Gd(NO3)3 were mixed in a container equipped with a stirrer, and adjusted to pH=7 by using ammonia. The chemical reaction equations are as follows:

                     The deposit of GdVO4 was washed by the distilled water, centrifugated, dried, pressed to sheet and sintered to obtained white polycrystalline materials. The synthesis method of NdVO4 is the same as GdVO4 (The starting materials, Nd2O3, is spectroscopic pure).
                     Another material, Ca3(VO4)2, was synthesized with NH4VO3 and CaCO3(≥99% analytically pure) by solid-phase reaction. The chemical reaction equations are as follows:
                           
                              2NH4VO3

                     The well-proportioned admixture was pressed to sheet and sintered for 8 h at 850 °C, and then sintered at 1000 °C for 8 h. Finally we obtained white Ca3(VO4)2.

                     Crystal growth
                     All the crystals in this paper were grown by the Czochralski method with a radio frequency furnace heating an iridium crucible (50 mm in diameter and 45 mm in height) [7,8].The growth atmosphere is N2 (purity: 99.99%, pressure: 0.14 MPa); in order to avoid the formation of the polycrystals in the process of crystal growth, it is necessary to remain at a temperature of 50–100 °C higher than the melting point of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 polycrystalline materials for an hour. The pulling rate was 0.5 mm/h and the rotating velocity was 15–20 r/min. After crystallization, the crystals were pulled out of the melt and cooled down to room temperature at a speed of 8–100 °C/h. In the process of cooling, the atmosphere was supplied with 3–5 vol.% oxygen after the melt surface froze. Fig. 1
                         showed us the crystals and the wafer of the Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal.
2.3
                     Nd-doped concentration in the crystal
                     The dopant concentration in the crystal was measured by JY-ULTIMA-2 (type)-ICP emission spectrum apparatus using the solution samples prepared previously. In the table, C
                        l was calculated according to the quantity of GdVO4, Ca3(VO4)2, NdVO4 in the melt, which is added to the iridium crucible at the beginning of crystal growth.
2.4
                     X-ray powder diffraction of the crystal
                     The XRD patterns of Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals was taken with a computer-automated diffractometer (Rigaku D/max-3C).The lattice parameters of the crystals were calculated by X-pert plus program.
2.5
                     Polarized absorption spectrum measurement
                     The polarized absorption spectrum of Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 was mensurated by Perkin–Elmer Lambda 35 UV/VIS spectrum apparatus in the wavelength range of 400 nm–1200 nm.
2.6
                     The Raman spectra of the crystal
                     The Raman spectra of the crystal was measured by RERKZN-ELMER 2000 Raman spectra apparatus. Excitation wavelength is 1064 nm, power is 100 mW, and resolving power is 4.0 cm−1.

The deposit of GdVO4 was washed by the distilled water, centrifugated, dried, pressed to sheet and sintered to obtained white polycrystalline materials. The synthesis method of NdVO4 is the same as GdVO4 (The starting materials, Nd2O3, is spectroscopic pure).
Another material, Ca3(VO4)2, was synthesized with NH4VO3 and CaCO3(≥99% analytically pure) by solid-phase reaction. The chemical reaction equations are as follows:
                           
                              2NH4VO3
                                 =V2O5
                                 +2NH3↑+H2O↑; 3CaCO3
                                 +V2O5
                                 =Ca3(VO4)2
                                 +3CO2↑
The well-proportioned admixture was pressed to sheet and sintered for 8 h at 850 °C, and then sintered at 1000 °C for 8 h. Finally we obtained white Ca3(VO4)2.

Crystal growth:
All the crystals in this paper were grown by the Czochralski method with a radio frequency furnace heating an iridium crucible (50 mm in diameter and 45 mm in height) [7,8].The growth atmosphere is N2 (purity: 99.99%, pressure: 0.14 MPa); in order to avoid the formation of the polycrystals in the process of crystal growth, it is necessary to remain at a temperature of 50–100 °C higher than the melting point of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 polycrystalline materials for an hour. The pulling rate was 0.5 mm/h and the rotating velocity was 15–20 r/min. After crystallization, the crystals were pulled out of the melt and cooled down to room temperature at a speed of 8–100 °C/h. In the process of cooling, the atmosphere was supplied with 3–5 vol.% oxygen after the melt surface froze. Fig. 1
                         showed us the crystals and the wafer of the Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal.

Nd-doped concentration in the crystal:
The dopant concentration in the crystal was measured by JY-ULTIMA-2 (type)-ICP emission spectrum apparatus using the solution samples prepared previously. In the table, C
                        l was calculated according to the quantity of GdVO4, Ca3(VO4)2, NdVO4 in the melt, which is added to the iridium crucible at the beginning of crystal growth.

X-ray powder diffraction of the crystal:
The XRD patterns of Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals was taken with a computer-automated diffractometer (Rigaku D/max-3C).The lattice parameters of the crystals were calculated by X-pert plus program.

Polarized absorption spectrum measurement:
The polarized absorption spectrum of Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 was mensurated by Perkin–Elmer Lambda 35 UV/VIS spectrum apparatus in the wavelength range of 400 nm–1200 nm.

The Raman spectra of the crystal:
There is a sharp contrast of the Raman spectra between the GdVO4 crystal and the Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal through Figs. 8–11
                        
                        
                        
                        . After choosing Ca as a substitute for gadolinium, the peak intensity of the Raman spectra of Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal was clearly stronger than the GdVO4 crystal at near 890 cm−1.This result indicates the Raman performance of Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal was improved.

                     Segregation coefficient
                     The formula of the segregation coefficient is as follows [9]: k
                        
                           e
                        
                        =
                        C
                        s
                        /Cl,in which, C
                        s is the doped-ion concentration in the crystal and C
                        l is the doped-ion concentration in the melt. The segregation coefficients of Nd3+ and Ca2+ are shown in Table 1
                        .
                     From Table 1, the segregation coefficient of Nd3+ in Ca
                           x
                        Gd1−
                           x
                        VO4 crystals increases with the increasing of the Nd3+-doped concentration, and the value of k
                        Nd in the Ca
                           x
                        Gd1−
                           x
                        VO4 crystal is less than 1.00, so C
                        l increases in growth process and C
                        s increases accordingly. Thus, the dopant concentration increases by degrees along the growth axis of the crystal. In order to reduce the concentration gradient of the doped ions in the crystal, it is an accepted method to descend the pulling rate and increase the rotative velocity step by step. The segregation coefficient (0.71) of Nd3+ in Ca
                           x
                        Gd1−
                           x
                        VO4 crystals is lower than that of GdVO4 crystals (0.78) [10]. According to k
                        
                           e
                         (Ca2+), we adjusted the value of C
                        l to keep the quantity of Ca2+ constant. Thus, the different Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals can be grown.
3.2
                     Lattice parameters
                     The XRD pattern of Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals are shown in Fig. 2
                        .The lattice parameters of Nd: Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals are listed in Table 3. The indexing data of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals are listed in Table 2
                        .
                     From Fig. 2 and Table 3
                        , the lattice parameters of Gd0.08V0.92O4 crystal are close to that of pure GdVO4 crystal [11].Contrasted with the X-ray pattern of pure GdVO4 crystal [12], there is no other diffraction peak. It indicates that substituting Ca2+ is well-proportioned in GdVO4.
                     As Table 3 shows, after the Nd3+ replaced Gd3+ in Gd0.08V0.92O4 crystal, the lattice parameters become bigger. The probable reason is the radius of Nd3+ ion is bigger than that of Gd3+ ion. But the crystal structure was markedly not changed. Fig. 3
                         shows the relation of the lattice volume (nm3
                        ×10−3) versus the concentration of Nd3+-doped ions (at.%). With the increasing of Nd3+-doped concentration, the lattice volume of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals increases accordingly.
3.3
                     Polarized absorption spectrum
                     The absorption spectrograms are as follows (Figs. 4–7
                        
                        
                        
                        ).
                     As a result, there is visible polarization in the absorption spectrogram of each sample. From Table 4
                         we know that ∏-polarization absorption is stronger than σ-polarization absorption of each crystal, especially to 1.48 at.% Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal.
                     The formulas of calculating the absorption cross-section are as follows:

                     Thus it can be seen, the absorption cross-section of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals is big at 808 nm. It is fit to be pumped by LD.

                     Fluorescence lifetime
                     The fluorescence lifetime of the crystals at 1064 nm are listed in Table 6
                        . The excitation wavelength is 808 nm.
                     From Table 6, with the increase of the concentration of Nd3+ ions, the lifetime of energy transition (4

So substituting Ca2+ benefits increasing the Nd-doped concentration in Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal, and the absorption of LD pumped lamp is enhanced.

                     Emission cross-section
                     Based on the Judd–Ofelt theory, the emission cross-sections in this crystal were calculated.
                     The emission cross-sections of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals are listed in Table 7
                        .
                     Through the Table 7, we can know the value of σ

                        ·
                        τ, the more advantageous is the formation and output of laser. So 1.48 at.% Nd3+-doped concentration is fittest in Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal. Although the emission cross-section of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal are lower than it of Nd:GdVO4 
                        [14,15], there is no great effect of spectral parameter of the crystal. It is easy to realize laser output.

                     The Raman spectra of the crystal
                     There is a sharp contrast of the Raman spectra between the GdVO4 crystal and the Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal through Figs. 8–11
                        
                        
                        
                        . After choosing Ca as a substitute for gadolinium, the peak intensity of the Raman spectra of Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal was clearly stronger than the GdVO4 crystal at near 890 cm−1.This result indicates the Raman performance of Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal was improved.

Segregation coefficient:
The formula of the segregation coefficient is as follows [9]: k
                        
                           e
                        
                        =
                        C
                        s
                        /Cl,in which, C
                        s is the doped-ion concentration in the crystal and C
                        l is the doped-ion concentration in the melt. The segregation coefficients of Nd3+ and Ca2+ are shown in Table 1
                        .
From Table 1, the segregation coefficient of Nd3+ in Ca
                           x
                        Gd1−
                           x
                        VO4 crystals increases with the increasing of the Nd3+-doped concentration, and the value of k
                        Nd in the Ca
                           x
                        Gd1−
                           x
                        VO4 crystal is less than 1.00, so C
                        l increases in growth process and C
                        s increases accordingly. Thus, the dopant concentration increases by degrees along the growth axis of the crystal. In order to reduce the concentration gradient of the doped ions in the crystal, it is an accepted method to descend the pulling rate and increase the rotative velocity step by step. The segregation coefficient (0.71) of Nd3+ in Ca
                           x
                        Gd1−
                           x
                        VO4 crystals is lower than that of GdVO4 crystals (0.78) [10]. According to k
                        
                           e
                         (Ca2+), we adjusted the value of C
                        l to keep the quantity of Ca2+ constant. Thus, the different Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals can be grown.

Lattice parameters:
The XRD pattern of Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals are shown in Fig. 2
                        .The lattice parameters of Nd: Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals are listed in Table 3. The indexing data of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals are listed in Table 2
                        .
From Fig. 2 and Table 3
                        , the lattice parameters of Gd0.08V0.92O4 crystal are close to that of pure GdVO4 crystal [11].Contrasted with the X-ray pattern of pure GdVO4 crystal [12], there is no other diffraction peak. It indicates that substituting Ca2+ is well-proportioned in GdVO4.
As Table 3 shows, after the Nd3+ replaced Gd3+ in Gd0.08V0.92O4 crystal, the lattice parameters become bigger. The probable reason is the radius of Nd3+ ion is bigger than that of Gd3+ ion. But the crystal structure was markedly not changed. Fig. 3
                         shows the relation of the lattice volume (nm3
                        ×10−3) versus the concentration of Nd3+-doped ions (at.%). With the increasing of Nd3+-doped concentration, the lattice volume of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals increases accordingly.

Polarized absorption spectrum:
The absorption spectrograms are as follows (Figs. 4–7
                        
                        
                        
                        ).
As a result, there is visible polarization in the absorption spectrogram of each sample. From Table 4
                         we know that ∏-polarization absorption is stronger than σ-polarization absorption of each crystal, especially to 1.48 at.% Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal.
The formulas of calculating the absorption cross-section are as follows:

Conclusions:
(1)
                           The average value of the segregation coefficient of Nd3+ ions in Nd: Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals is 0.71 which is lower than that of Nd:GdVO4 crystals. This indicates that substituting Ca2+ in Nd:GdVO4 crystals decreases the segregation coefficient of Nd3+ ions.

                           A 1.48 at.% Nd3+-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal has wider absorption peak at 809 nm. Its FWHM (10 nm) is bigger than FWHM (1.6 nm) [16] of the Nd:GdVO4 crystal. It makes for GaAlAs laser diode pumped and debases the need of temperature of LD.

                           When Ca substituted for gadolinium, the Raman performance of Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal was improved.

Laser diode pumped solid-state lasers have a variety of applications such as in militaries, industries, medical treatments, and scientific research, due to their high level of stability, compactness, efficiency, and longevity. The Nd:GdVO4 crystal has excellent laser properties in high-power laser systems. It is better than that of Nd:YVO4. Many laser experiments have shown that Nd:GdVO4 crystal is an efficient LD pumped solid-state laser crystal [1–6]. However, the intensity of Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) is quite weak for the GdVO4 crystal. In order to improve its Raman performance, the Ca-doped GdVO4 crystals have been grown and investigated in our laboratory. This paper deals with the effect of Calcium on Nd:GdVO4 single crystal.

The raw material, GdVO4, was prepared by liquid-phase reaction. At first, NH4VO3 (≥99% analytically pure) powder was dissolved in the heated distilled water, and then filtrated to clarify the solution. Secondly, Gd2O3 (≥99.999% spectroscopic pure) powder was dissolved in the heated dilute nitric acid. Finally, the solutions of NH4VO3 and Gd(NO3)3 were mixed in a container equipped with a stirrer, and adjusted to pH=7 by using ammonia. The chemical reaction equations are as follows:

The deposit of GdVO4 was washed by the distilled water, centrifugated, dried, pressed to sheet and sintered to obtained white polycrystalline materials. The synthesis method of NdVO4 is the same as GdVO4 (The starting materials, Nd2O3, is spectroscopic pure).

Another material, Ca3(VO4)2, was synthesized with NH4VO3 and CaCO3(≥99% analytically pure) by solid-phase reaction. The chemical reaction equations are as follows:
                           
                              2NH4VO3
                                 =V2O5
                                 +2NH3↑+H2O↑; 3CaCO3
                                 +V2O5
                                 =Ca3(VO4)2
                                 +3CO2↑

The well-proportioned admixture was pressed to sheet and sintered for 8 h at 850 °C, and then sintered at 1000 °C for 8 h. Finally we obtained white Ca3(VO4)2.

All the crystals in this paper were grown by the Czochralski method with a radio frequency furnace heating an iridium crucible (50 mm in diameter and 45 mm in height) [7,8].The growth atmosphere is N2 (purity: 99.99%, pressure: 0.14 MPa); in order to avoid the formation of the polycrystals in the process of crystal growth, it is necessary to remain at a temperature of 50–100 °C higher than the melting point of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 polycrystalline materials for an hour. The pulling rate was 0.5 mm/h and the rotating velocity was 15–20 r/min. After crystallization, the crystals were pulled out of the melt and cooled down to room temperature at a speed of 8–100 °C/h. In the process of cooling, the atmosphere was supplied with 3–5 vol.% oxygen after the melt surface froze. Fig. 1
                         showed us the crystals and the wafer of the Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal.

The dopant concentration in the crystal was measured by JY-ULTIMA-2 (type)-ICP emission spectrum apparatus using the solution samples prepared previously. In the table, C
                        l was calculated according to the quantity of GdVO4, Ca3(VO4)2, NdVO4 in the melt, which is added to the iridium crucible at the beginning of crystal growth.

The XRD patterns of Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals was taken with a computer-automated diffractometer (Rigaku D/max-3C).The lattice parameters of the crystals were calculated by X-pert plus program.

The polarized absorption spectrum of Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 was mensurated by Perkin–Elmer Lambda 35 UV/VIS spectrum apparatus in the wavelength range of 400 nm–1200 nm.

The Raman spectra of the crystal was measured by RERKZN-ELMER 2000 Raman spectra apparatus. Excitation wavelength is 1064 nm, power is 100 mW, and resolving power is 4.0 cm−1.

The formula of the segregation coefficient is as follows [9]: k
                        
                           e

                        /Cl,in which, C
                        s is the doped-ion concentration in the crystal and C
                        l is the doped-ion concentration in the melt. The segregation coefficients of Nd3+ and Ca2+ are shown in Table 1
                        .

From Table 1, the segregation coefficient of Nd3+ in Ca
                           x
                        Gd1−
                           x
                        VO4 crystals increases with the increasing of the Nd3+-doped concentration, and the value of k
                        Nd in the Ca
                           x

                           x
                        VO4 crystal is less than 1.00, so C
                        l increases in growth process and C
                        s increases accordingly. Thus, the dopant concentration increases by degrees along the growth axis of the crystal. In order to reduce the concentration gradient of the doped ions in the crystal, it is an accepted method to descend the pulling rate and increase the rotative velocity step by step. The segregation coefficient (0.71) of Nd3+ in Ca
                           x
                        Gd1−

                        VO4 crystals is lower than that of GdVO4 crystals (0.78) [10]. According to k
                        
                           e
                         (Ca2+), we adjusted the value of C
                        l to keep the quantity of Ca2+ constant. Thus, the different Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals can be grown.

The XRD pattern of Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals are shown in Fig. 2
                        .The lattice parameters of Nd: Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals are listed in Table 3. The indexing data of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals are listed in Table 2
                        .

From Fig. 2 and Table 3
                        , the lattice parameters of Gd0.08V0.92O4 crystal are close to that of pure GdVO4 crystal [11].Contrasted with the X-ray pattern of pure GdVO4 crystal [12], there is no other diffraction peak. It indicates that substituting Ca2+ is well-proportioned in GdVO4.

As Table 3 shows, after the Nd3+ replaced Gd3+ in Gd0.08V0.92O4 crystal, the lattice parameters become bigger. The probable reason is the radius of Nd3+ ion is bigger than that of Gd3+ ion. But the crystal structure was markedly not changed. Fig. 3
                         shows the relation of the lattice volume (nm3
                        ×10−3) versus the concentration of Nd3+-doped ions (at.%). With the increasing of Nd3+-doped concentration, the lattice volume of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals increases accordingly.

The absorption spectrograms are as follows (Figs. 4–7
                        
                        
                        
                        ).

As a result, there is visible polarization in the absorption spectrogram of each sample. From Table 4
                         we know that ∏-polarization absorption is stronger than σ-polarization absorption of each crystal, especially to 1.48 at.% Nd-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal.

The formulas of calculating the absorption cross-section are as follows:

                        0, I are the intensity of incident light and transmitted light respectively, L is the thickness of crystal slice, N
                        0 is volume concentration of ion. The absorption cross-sections of the crystals are shown in Table 5
                        .

Thus it can be seen, the absorption cross-section of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals is big at 808 nm. It is fit to be pumped by LD.

The fluorescence lifetime of the crystals at 1064 nm are listed in Table 6
                        . The excitation wavelength is 808 nm.

From Table 6, with the increase of the concentration of Nd3+ ions, the lifetime of energy transition (4

                        3/2

                        11/2) of Nd3+ ions become smaller and smaller, and the fluorescence quenching effect of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal is weaker than Nd:YVO4/GdVO4 crystals [13]. So substituting Ca2+ benefits increasing the Nd-doped concentration in Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal, and the absorption of LD pumped lamp is enhanced.

Based on the Judd–Ofelt theory, the emission cross-sections in this crystal were calculated.

The emission cross-sections of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals are listed in Table 7
                        .

Through the Table 7, we can know the value of σ

                        τ of 1.48 at.% Nd3+-doped Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal is biggest. The threshold value of laser is in inverse proportion to the value of σ

                        ·
                        τ. That is to say, the bigger is the value of σ

                        τ, the more advantageous is the formation and output of laser. So 1.48 at.% Nd3+-doped concentration is fittest in Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal. Although the emission cross-section of Nd:Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal are lower than it of Nd:GdVO4 
                        [14,15], there is no great effect of spectral parameter of the crystal. It is easy to realize laser output.

There is a sharp contrast of the Raman spectra between the GdVO4 crystal and the Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal through Figs. 8–11
                        
                        
                        
                        . After choosing Ca as a substitute for gadolinium, the peak intensity of the Raman spectra of Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal was clearly stronger than the GdVO4 crystal at near 890 cm−1.This result indicates the Raman performance of Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystal was improved.

                           The average value of the segregation coefficient of Nd3+ ions in Nd: Ca0.08Gd0.92VO4 crystals is 0.71 which is lower than that of Nd:GdVO4 crystals. This indicates that substituting Ca2+ in Nd:GdVO4 crystals decreases the segregation coefficient of Nd3+ ions.

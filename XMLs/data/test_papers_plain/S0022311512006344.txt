                  Thorium dioxide doped with oxides of magnesium and calcium was prepared from deagglomerated mixed oxalates. The influence of the dopant oxide concentration (0.1, 0.25 and 0.5mol% MO, M=Mg, Ca) on the powder properties was studied. The dependence of bulk density, specific surface area, X-ray crystallite size, residual carbon content and distribution of particle size on the dopant concentrations was investigated in detail. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed that the powders comprised cuboidal agglomerates with a nanocrystalline substructure (10nm). It was found that 0.5mol% calcia doped thoria exhibits better sinterability than pure thoria and magnesia doped thoria at a temperature as low as 1673K. Further, it was demonstrated for the first time that doping nanocrystalline thoria with calcia helps reduce the de-sintering phenomena.

Tel.: +91 44 2748 0500x24069; fax: +91 44 2748 0065.     Thorium dioxide doped with oxides of magnesium and calcium was prepared from deagglomerated mixed oxalates. The influence of the dopant oxide concentration (0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mol% MO, M = Mg, Ca) on the powder properties was studied. The dependence of bulk density, specific surface area, X-ray crystallite size, residual carbon content and distribution of particle size on the dopant concentrations was investigated in detail. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed that the powders comprised cuboidal agglomerates with a nanocrystalline substructure (10 nm). It was found that 0.5 mol% calcia doped thoria exhibits better sinterability than pure thoria and magnesia doped thoria at a temperature as low as 1673 K. Further, it was demonstrated for the first time that doping nanocrystalline thoria with calcia helps reduce the de-sintering phenomena.    1 Introduction Thorium oxide (thoria) is an important ceramic oxide used in the nuclear industry. High density thoria pellets are used in pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs) for flux flattening and in the blankets of Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) [1] . It is one of the oxides that are being considered as a matrix for the selective partitioning and transmutation of plutonium and minor actinides [2,3] . The chemical inertness and high melting point (3573 K) [4]  of thoria make it suitable for applications in other industries as well. It is used as a stabilizer in tungsten electrodes in TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welding, and in the manufacture of electron tubes [5] . Yttria doped thoria (YDT) is used as an oxide ion conducting solid electrolyte in the construction of galvanic cells used in the measurement of oxygen partial pressures at high temperatures [6] . Most of the applications mentioned above require the use of thorium oxide bodies with a sintered density better than 95% TD. These are usually obtained by sintering at temperatures above 2073 K. Thus the fabrication of high density thoria is an expensive and energy intensive process. However, recent investigations on the citrate-gel-combustion synthesis of thoria have shown that nanocrystalline thoria could be sintered to a final density of 9.6 Mg m−3  at a temperature as low as 1573 K [7–10] . Further, it has also been demonstrated that doping aliovalent cations in nanocrystalline thoria enhances the cation diffusivity and brings about activated sintering [7,11] . Citrate gel-combustion is amenable for such a doping and ensures a homogeneous distribution of the dopant ion in the host matrix. In spite of these advantages, nanocrystalline thoria derived through the citrate-gel combustion was not found suitable for the fabrication of crucibles for it yielded products with a large fraction of microporosity [12]  that led to an undesirable reduction in density when sintered at a higher temperature (1873 K). A similar observation has been observed in sol–gel derived thoria, which was termed as de-sintering by Morgan and McCorckle [13] . Investigations carried out in our laboratory [14]  had revealed that the thoria powders derived from deagglomerated thorium oxalate are nanocrystalline and exhibit a better densification behaviour than those derived through gel-combustion. Another investigation [11]  also suggests that the de-sintering in combustion derived thoria could be brought down by doping it with calcia and magnesia. Thus it is expected that nanocrystalline thoria derived from thorium oxalate doped with calcia or magnesia would be most suitable for making high density thoria ceramics. Since, no systematic investigation has so far been reported on the sinterability of oxalate derived nanocrystalline thoria doped with calcia and magnesia, we investigated the sinterability of the same in this study. We have also investigated the effect of both the temperature (1473, 1673 and 1873 K) and the concentration (0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mol%) of the dopants (CaO, MgO) on the sinterability of nanocrystalline thoria.  2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals Nuclear grade thorium (IV) nitrate penta hydrate was obtained from M/s. Indian Rare Earths Ltd., Mumbai, India. Calcium nitrate (AR grade) was supplied by M/s. E. Merck (India) Ltd., Mumbai, India. Magnesium nitrate of purity better than 99% was obtained from M/s. Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland.  2.2 Experimental procedure In a typical experiment, about 50 g of thorium nitrate, appropriate quantities of magnesium nitrate (or calcium nitrate) and oxalic acid were dissolved separately in a minimum amount of distilled water (about 75 mL). The concentration of the dopants were so chosen as to correspond to a final composition of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mol%, MO (M = Ca, Mg). The mixed oxalates were quantitatively precipitated by the slow addition of oxalic acid solution to the solution of nitrates (at 298 K). The completion of the reaction was verified by ascertaining that no precipitation took place when an excess aliquot of oxalic acid solution was added to the filtrate. The precipitate was filtered under suction, through a sintered glass (G3) frit. Subsequently this precipitate was dispersed in propan-2-one with the help of ultrasonication (90 s) in order to obtain a homogeneous suspension. Once again this suspension was filtered as before. This procedure was repeated twice and the precipitate thus obtained was dried under an infrared (IR) lamp for about an hour. The mixed oxalate was decomposed by calcination in air at 923 K for 4 h in a furnace fitted with silicon carbide heating elements. The powders synthesized in this study were identified by using the following nomenclature. The oxalate powders were designated as O while the products obtained by their calcination were named T. The suffix P was used to denote pure thoria while thoria powders doped with calcia and magnesia were identified by suffices C and M respectively. Their labels were further appended with 0.1, 0.25 or 0.5 indicating the nominal concentration of the dopant in mole percent. These indices are used throughout this article. The calcined powders were compacted at 200 MPa in a die lined with tungsten carbide into pellets having a diameter of about 10 mm and a thickness of about 3 mm by using plungers made out of tungsten carbide. An automated double action hydraulic press (M/s. Bemco Ltd., India) was used for compaction. The green compacts were sintered in a furnace equipped with molybdenum di-silicide heating elements (M/s. Carbolite, UK), at 1473, 1673 or 1873 K in air for 4 h. A moderate rate of heating and cooling (300 K h−1 ) were employed in order to minimize the thermal shock experienced by these specimens.  2.3 Characterization of starting materials, powders and compacts The impurities present in the thorium nitrate used in the present investigation were analysed by using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICPMS, model Elan 250, supplied by M/s. Sciex, Toronto, Canada). The surface area of the powders was measured by using the BET (Brauner, Emmett, and Teller) isotherm method with nitrogen as the adsorbate (Monosorb-16, M/s. Quantachrome Inc., USA). The particle size analyses were carried out with the help of laser light scattering (Mastersizer, M/s. Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). An XPERT MPD X-ray diffractometer system supplied by M/s. Philips, Holland was used for recording the X-ray powder diffraction patterns. The lattice strain and the mean crystallite size were measured by using the Hall Williams method [15] . The instrumental broadening was obtained by using a silicon single crystal. The geometric density of the green compacts was estimated from their dimensions and weights while the density of the sintered specimens was measured by using the liquid immersion method with dibutyl phthalate as the pycnometric liquid. The residual carbon present in the powders and sintered pellets was determined by heating these samples in a stream of oxygen. The carbon dioxide thus evolved was measured by using an infrared detector. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used in order to examine the morphology and microstructure of these powders. A small quantity of the powder under investigation was suspended in methanol, deagglomerated by sonicating it in an ultrasonic bath and a drop of this suspension was placed on a copper grid coated with holey carbon film. A JEOL 2000 EX-II TEM with a top entry goniometer, operated at 200 kV was used to record the diffraction patterns as well as phase contrast images and diffraction. In order to record their microstructure, the sintered pellets were ground and polished by using a standard ceramographic procedure and were thermally etched at their sintering temperature. The microstructure was recorded by using a scanning electron microscope (ESEM, Philips XL 30, The Netherlands).   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Precipitation of the oxalate Particles of thorium oxide assume the shape of the precursor from which they are derived, a fact often referred to as pseudomorphism [16] . The precipitation process starts with a molecular precursor that subsequently grows through a nanosized state that agglomerates into a microcrystalline precipitate [17] . Further the conditions of precipitation (pH and temperature) could also influence the morphology of the precipitate [18] . Factors that significantly influence the nucleation and growth of the precursor precipitate would influence the distribution of sizes [19]  among the precursor particles. The agglomeration of nanocrystalline powders could be by washing the precipitate with a less polar solvent. Kaliszewski and Heuer [20]  demonstrated that the strength of these agglomerates stems from the polar interaction between the bridging water molecules and the surface hydroxyls that are hydrogen bonded. It has further been demonstrated that the strength of these agglomerates as well as the growth of crystallites in a ceramic powder could be effectively controlled by crystallizing the precursor in an organic solvent with lower surface tension [20] . Our earlier investigations demonstrated that higher degree of agitation during the precipitation tends to reduce the mean size of the precipitate particles [12] . Oktay and Yayli [18]  demonstrated that the size of thorium oxalate particles could be reduced by ultrasonication and that their size distribution has a bearing on their pyrolysis. The precipitation carried out by adding oxalic acid to the mixed nitrate solution was found to yield a free flowing and less agglomerated thorium oxalate powder than those obtained by reversing the order of addition of the reactants. XRD analysis of the dried precipitate showed that it comprised nanocrystalline thorium oxalate. Further the precipitation reaction was not influenced by the presence of the dopant cation. Thus powders of both pure and doped thorium oxalate were identical in their characteristics.  3.2 Characteristics of the powders The bulk densities of the thoria powders were found to lie between 1 and 1.2 Mg m−3  (Table 1   and Fig. 1  ). These values are comparable with those pertaining to pure [11]  and doped thoria [14]  reported in earlier investigations. Even though the bulk density does not show any dependence on the dopant concentration, a marginal increase in the same is observed with the concentration of calcia in the host matrix while the magnesia doped powders did not exhibit such behaviour. The values of specific surface area of these powders (Table 1  and Fig. 2  ) were not significantly affected by the concentration of the dopant. This observation is similar to the trend observed in Ref. [11]  and is in contrast to the results reported in an earlier study on thoria doped with cations of group VB [7] . Addition of dopants that are known to enhance the sinterability could result in substantial binding between the constituent particles in agglomerate and enhance the bulk density of that powder [10] . However this study does not reveal such a trend. Plausibly neither the conditions employed for calcination nor the concentration of dopants caused a significant growth of the crystallites or bonding between the agglomerates. The XRD patterns (Fig. 3  ) pertaining to the calcined powders ascertained their phase purity and that their constituent crystallites had a typical size of about 10 nm. The crystallite size of the thorium oxalate (primary) particles is governed by the precipitation conditions while that of thoria (secondary) particles depends upon on the size of the precursor as well as on the temperature and duration of calcination. Allred et al. [21]  reported that the X-ray crystallite size of thoria derived through the oxalate route varies exponentially with the temperature of calcination. An earlier investigation [14]  carried out in our laboratory revealed that a similar trend is observed with thoria derived through the oxalate de-agglomeration route. However, the latter powders were found to have a much smaller crystallite size than those reported in Ref. [17] . The X-ray crystallite sizes of the powders obtained in this study were comparable to those reported in Ref. [14]  and were not affected by the concentration of the dopant. This further substantiates the fact that the dopant did not cause any significant pre-sintering among the particles and augurs well with the dependence of bulk density on the concentration of the dopant discussed in the previous section. Yet another important observation is that the crystallite size of these powders was smaller than those derived through combustion synthesis, reported in an earlier study [6] . The distribution of particle sizes in the thoria powders are depicted in Fig. 4   and Table 2  . The size distribution of the agglomerates did not show any systematic dependence on the dopant concentration. This observation augurs well with the other characteristics discussed above. However, pure thoria powders exhibited an enhancement in the size fraction of the agglomerates with a mean size greater than 100 μm. This could be due to the agglomeration of the particulates in the dispersion medium during the particle size measurement. Ultrasonication of the suspension during the particle size measurement could lead to fracture of these particulates and introduce experimental artifacts. In view of the above it is reasonable to conclude that the dopants did not influence the size distribution significantly. All the thoria powders were free flowing and the green compacts (120 MPa) obtained from them had similar densities (about 50–52% TD), revealing that their constituent agglomerates had comparable strength.  3.3 Residual carbon The amounts of carbon residue in the powders obtained in this study are listed in Table 1 . The calcined powders had a residual carbon content of about 1000–1800 ppm. These values are much lower than those observed for the powders derived through gel-combustion [8] . The quantity of carbon residue did not show any systematic dependence on the concentration of the dopant.  3.4 Microstructure The SEM image of the powders obtained in this study is shown in Fig. 5  . From this figure it is evident that these particles possess irregular cuboidal morphology and do not possess any submicron porosity, unlike their combustion derived counterparts [11] . Further the EDAX analysis revealed that thorium was the major constituent and that no second phase was precipitated in the host matrix. It has been demonstrated [14]  that oxalate derived thoria possesses a cuboidal morphology, while deagglomerated thorium oxalate yields thoria platelets which are only about a few nanometers thick. No systematic variation in the morphology was discernible with the concentration of the dopants. Fig. 5 a, is a bright-field image of the 0.5 mol% CaO doped thorium oxalate revealing cuboids with a size of about 0.5 μm. The rough cuboids of the oxalate particles (not shown) composed of randomly oriented nanocrystallites got transformed into sharp cuboids upon doping with calcia. Higher resolution imaging showed that these cuboids are agglomerates of irregularly-shaped nanocrystallites with a size in the range 5–10 nm. A close inspection of the lattice planes along an edge of a cuboidal agglomerate (Fig. 5 b) where lattice planes with a spacing of about 0.3 nm are imaged shows that the nanocrystallites do not follow any systematic orientation relationships with the flat outer surface of the cuboids. Thoria powders derived from calcination of these agglomerates exhibiting an external cuboidal morphology also showed a similar morphology. The calcination process had the effect of smoothing out surface irregularities in the precursor particles resulting in sharp edges and corners. Fig. 6  a, is a lattice image from one such agglomerate of undoped thoria. It is evident from this figure that the agglomerates are composed of randomly oriented nanocrystallites with a size of about ∼10 nm. A small number of 1–2 nm sized voids were seen at some of the triple line junctions. Fig. 6 b is a higher magnification detail from a typical nanocrystallite in the [1 1 0] orientation where it is seen that the surface is facetted. Fig. 6 c shows a dark-field image from the calcia doped thoria recorded with a section of the (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) diffraction rings. The image shows a region of overlap of two cuboidal agglomerates. The nanocrystallites within are randomly oriented and no nano-sized voids could be detected in the regions observed. Fig. 6 d shows typical interfaces between the nanocrystallites where no structural evidence for segregation of dopant could be seen. The crystallite sizes are in agreement with the XRD derived values presented in Table 1 .  3.5 Characteristics of the pellets A compaction pressure of 200 MPa was required in order to obtain green pellets with a density better than 50% TD. This value is more than the critical compaction pressure of 120 MPa reported for thoria derived through the conventional oxalate route [22] . Nanocrystalline powders often require higher compaction pressures [23]  due to a higher magnitude of interparticle friction. Further it is reported that nanocrystalline powders need not be compacted to 50% TD in order to obtain a final product with a density higher than 90% TD [23] . Hence pellets with a lower density obtained by precompacting at 120 MPa, (that did not possess the desired handling strength) were crushed and re-compacted at a final compaction pressure of 200 MPa. The densities of these green pellets are given in Table 3  . There is no significant variation in the green densities of the pellets with an increase in dopant concentration. Almost all the green pellets exhibited a theoretical density of about 50% TD. This observation is consistent with the particle size distribution and bulk density data. The sintered densities of the pellets obtained from pure and doped thoria are listed in Table 3 . The dependence of the sintered densities of the pellets on the concentration of the dopants MgO and CaO are depicted in Figs. 7 and 8    respectively. The data reported in an earlier study [11]  on the sinterability of combustion derived nanocrystalline thoria doped with MgO and CaO are also shown in these figures for comparison. These data bring out the following facts. All the powders sinter to a density better than 95% TD at 1473 K. However, the densities of the pellets sintered at 1673 K are lower than those sintered at 1473 and 1873 K. Magnesia doped thoria sinters to lower densities at temperatures above 1473 K. These density values are comparable with that of pure thoria sintered under identical conditions. Compared to the combustion derived magnesia doped thoria [11]  the powders obtained in this study sinter better and exhibit lesser reduction in density when sintered at temperatures above 1473 K. Thoria doped with calcia sinters to higher densities than those doped with magnesia. In most cases a density better than 95% TD was observed. The sintering experiment carried out at 1473 K did not reveal any systematic dependence on the concentration of the dopant while the experiments carried out at 1673 and 1873 K showed a discernible trend. In the latter a threshold concentration of 0.25 mol% was found necessary in order to achieve a density better than 95% TD. Further pure thoria (TP) and TC0.10 were found to yield lesser densities when sintered at higher temperatures. Morgan and McCorkle [13]  reported that dense compacts (9.9 Mg m−1 ) of thorium dioxide obtained from sol–gel derived powder became less dense and the value of the density dropped to 8.9 Mg m−3  when reheated at 2073 K. This phenomenon is known as de-sintering and is believed to be due to coalescence of pores during resintering. The sintering behaviour of the powders TP and TC0.10 could be related to de-sintering. In the thorium oxide lattice, diffusion of Th4+  ions is many times slower than that of O2−  ions. Creation of point defects in this lattice enhances the rate of diffusion of the cation. These point defects could be created in two ways, viz., by additives and by controlling the sintering atmosphere. Doping a cation with a valence less than 4 (MgO, CaO) would create vacant oxygen sites while a cation with a valence more than four would create oxygen interstitials in the thoria lattice. Balakrishna et al. [24]  obtained densities in the range of 9.37–9.59 Mg m−3  for magnesium oxide doped, (oxalate derived) thorium dioxide sintered in pure hydrogen at 1973 K. The data presented here clearly demonstrates that the deagglomerated thoria powders doped with 0.25 mol% calcia (TC0.25) could be sintered to a density of 96.7% TD even at a temperature as low as 1473 K and is thus more sinteractive than the oxalate derived thoria that were physically doped with calcia [24] . From the foregoing it is evident that the addition of both calcia and magnesia does bring about a marginal increase in the sintered density of nanocrystalline thoria even at temperatures as low as 1473 K. Further it is also observed that the incorporation of calcia into the thorium dioxide lattice helps alleviate the problem of de-sintering observed in pure thoria pellets at temperatures above 1673 K. Balakrishna et al. [24]  reported that sintering in a reducing atmosphere enhances the sinterability of thoria doped with calcia and magnesia. Hence, it would be worthwhile to re-investigate the sinterability of these powders in a reducing ambience. In physical doping, the dopant oxide is interspersed between the particles of the host oxide (thoria). Thus a higher concentration of the dopant prevails in the vicinity of the grain boundaries at the start of the sintering. Hence, when the dopant is added by physical mixing, even a much lower concentration of the dopant could bring about accelerated sintering. However, if this dopant oxide is volatile, preferential vaporization could render the sintered compact porous [7] . In the physical doping procedure reported in Ref. [24]  a threshold concentration of 0.25 mol% MgO was necessary in order to bring about accelerated sintering in thoria. The present study reveals that the sinterability of nanocrystalline thoria is not altered significantly by doping with magnesia.  3.6 Analysis of microstructure From the SEM micrograph of sintered pellets obtained from TC0.50 shown in Fig. 9  , it is evident that this pellet has isolated closed pores. The energy dispersive X-ray analysis showed that thorium is the major constituent. No reflections pertaining to calcium could be discerned. The presence of porosity in the final product supports our surmise that calcium inhibits the elimination of the closed pores by coalescence in the final stages of sintering. Since de-sintering is a common phenomenon observed with the gel-combustion derived nanocrystalline powders, the observations made in this study are valuable in preventing the same. A sintered density as high as 98.8% TD, for thoria at a temperature as low as 1673 K is being reported for the first time.   4 Conclusions Nanocrystalline powders of pure thoria as well as thoria doped with calcia and magnesia were synthesized by using the oxalate de-agglomertion method. It was observed that the concentration of the dopant ion (Ca2+  and Mg2+ ) had a marginal influence on the bulk density and specific surface area while it did not affect the crystallite size of these powders. The residual carbon content was found to be of the same order in all the powders irrespective of the concentration of the dopant. Complex surface phenomena are at play during the precipitation of cuboidal nanocrystallite oxalate agglomerates from solution where the role of calcia is found to be significant. The reduction in the triple line defects in the doped oxide powder suggests that the dopant species has a beneficial effect on the consolidation process even at temperatures far below the sintering temperature. The TEM investigations of these powders reaffirmed that the dopants were uniformly distributed into the host matrix. Thus, this method is a novel procedure for synthesizing nanocrystalline thoria homogenously doped with cations of Group 2 elements at relatively low temperatures. The powders were irregular nanocrystallites agglomerated as cuboidal particles pseudomorphic with the oxalate precursor. These powders exhibited good compactibility and yielded green compacts with a density as high as 50% TD. A density as high as 98.8% TD could be obtained by doping calcia into thoria and at a temperature as low as 1673 K. This is so far the highest density reported in calcia doped thoria. Further calcium doping was found to prevent de-sintering, a common behaviour observed with most nanocrystalline powders.    References [1] K. Anantharaman  V. Shivakumar  D. Saha    J. Nucl.

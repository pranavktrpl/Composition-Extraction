              Journal of Solid State Chemistry Journal fla 00224596 255 219 224 219-224 text/plain 2017-11-30 November 2017 © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Elsevier Inc. Denisenko, Yu.G. Khritokhin, N.A. Andreev, O.V. Basova, S.A. Sal’nikova, E.I. Polkovnikov, A.A. 
                  Reactions of europium sulfates Eu2(SO4)3·8H2O and EuSO4 complete decomposition were studied by Simultaneous Thermal Analysis. It was revealed that one-step dehydratation of Eu2(SO4)3·8H2O crystallohydrate is accompanied by the formation of amorphous anhydrous europium sulfate Eu2(SO4)3. Crystallization of amorphous europium (III) sulfate occurs at 381.1°С (in argon) and 391.3°C (in air). The average enthalpy values for dehydratation reaction of Eu2(SO4)3·8H2O (ΔH° = 141.1kJ/mol), decomposition reactions of Eu2(SO4)3 (ΔH = 463.1kJ/mol), Eu2O2SO4 (ΔH = 378.4kJ/mol) and EuSO4 (ΔH = 124.1kJ/mol) were determined. The step process mechanisms of thermal decomposition of europium (III) sulfate in air and europium (II) sulfate in inert atmosphere were established and justified. The kinetic parameters of complete thermal decomposition of europium (III) sulfate octahydrate were calculated by Kissinger model. The standard enthalpies of compound formation were calculated using thermal effects and formation enthalpy data for binary compounds.

Institute of Chemistry, Tyumen State University Perekopskaya Str. 15a Tyumen 625003 Russia       Reactions of europium sulfates Eu2 (SO4 )3 ·8H2 O and EuSO4  complete decomposition were studied by Simultaneous Thermal Analysis. It was revealed that one-step dehydratation of Eu2 (SO4 )3 ·8H2 O crystallohydrate is accompanied by the formation of amorphous anhydrous europium sulfate Eu2 (SO4 )3 . Crystallization of amorphous europium (III) sulfate occurs at 381.1 °С (in argon) and 391.3 °C (in air). The average enthalpy values for dehydratation reaction of Eu2 (SO4 )3 ·8H2 O (ΔH° = 141.1 kJ/mol), decomposition reactions of Eu2 (SO4 )3  (ΔH = 463.1 kJ/mol), Eu2 O2 SO4  (ΔH = 378.4 kJ/mol) and EuSO4  (ΔH = 124.1 kJ/mol) were determined. The step process mechanisms of thermal decomposition of europium (III) sulfate in air and europium (II) sulfate in inert atmosphere were established and justified. The kinetic parameters of complete thermal decomposition of europium (III) sulfate octahydrate were calculated by Kissinger model. The standard enthalpies of compound formation were calculated using thermal effects and formation enthalpy data for binary compounds.

The network structure of europium sulfates crystallohydrates Eu2 (SO4 )3 ·nH2 O (n = 1, 4, 8) allows to consider them as catalysts for chemoselective oxidation of organic sulfides [1,2] , as well as radioactive waste recultivation agents [3]  and gas adsorption hosts [4] . Rare earth elements (REE) oxysulfates are precursors for obtaining Ln2 O2 S compounds [4–6] . Systems containing oxysulfates are practically important as a phosphorescent materials. Besides, they can be used in X-ray computed tomography and radioactive emission detectors [7–10] . The structural and chemical properties of REE oxysulfates allow to consider them as perspective materials for chemical adsorption and gaseous oxygen storage [11–14] . Europium (II) sulfate forms at the first stage of Eu2 (SO4 )3  reduction by hydrogen [4] . Eu2+  ion possesses properties similar to these of alkaline earth metals ions [15,16]  and, especially, the ion is similar to Sr2+  (r(Eu2+ ) = 0.131 nm, r(Sr2+ ) = 0.132 nm) [17] . Europium (II) sulfate is isomorphous to strontium and barium sulfates, and the similarity of the ions can also be noticed in non-aqueous solutions chemistry [18] . The reduction of MeSO4  (Me = Ca, Sr, Ba) compounds by hydrogen leads to sulfides MeS formation [19,20] , while reduction of europium sulfate by carbon monoxide [21]  and hydrogen [4]  leads to europium oxysulfate formation. In the literature, there was no information found about the europium (II) sulfate transformation upon heating. However, it is assumed that transformation will be significantly different to process typical for alkaline earth metals sulfates [22] :(1) MeSO4  → MeO + SO3     The research of thermal stability of europium sulfate crystallohydrates was performed in the range of papers ( Table 1 .) The data given in this researches are not consistent with each other. In work [24]  the formation of intermediate verified only by spectral analyses, and on DTA curves doesn’t appear at any way. The temperature ranges of reactions behavior were given only in paper [23] . The mentioned above researches doesn’t contain calculations of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of decomposition processes. Also, the causes of appearence of heat emission effects after complete dehydratation were not revealed, despite the fact that this effects were registered. The processes appeared during thermal decomposition of europium sulfates, thermal stability of the compounds and europium valence state persistence was not explored by thermal analysis methods with application of sensitive equipment. The present study is aimed at the investigation of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of europium sulfates Eu2 (SO4 )3 ·8H2 O and EuSO4  controlled thermal decomposition processes in inert (argon) and oxidative (air) atmosphere using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetry (TGA).  2 Methods and materials Europium sulfate octahydrate Eu2 (SO4 )3 ·8H2 O was obtained by crystallization from aqueous saturated solution under room temperature in vacuum desiccator under low pressure. The saturated solution was prepared from anhydrous europium sulfate (III) (99,99%, Ultrapure). 2.5 g of Eu2 (SO4 )3  was dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water at 20 °С. The crystallized solid product was separated from stock solution. Then, it was squeezed dry by filter paper and finally aged to reaching constant mass in desiccator with calcined silica gel on clock glass under room temperature. As the result, white shiny crystals of europium sulfate octahydrate (III) were obtained. Europium (II) sulfate was obtained by the procedure described in [4] . According this procedure, europium (III) sulfate was reduced by hydrogen under temperature of 500 °С. The X-ray powder diffraction data of synthesized sulfates and products of their thermal decomposition were collected with diffractometer DRON-7 in CuKα  – radiation with Ni-filter. The obtained X-ray diffraction patterns were analyzed accounting data from card index PDF-2. Thermal analysis in argon flow was carried out at Simultaneous Thermal Analysis (STA) equipment 499 F5 Jupiter NETZSCH (Germany). The powder samples were inserted into alumina crucibles. The heating rate was 3 °С/min. For enthalpy determination, the equipment was calibrated with use of standard substances, such as In, Sn, Bi, Zn, Al, Ag, Au, Ni. The heat effect peaks were determined with package "Proteus 6 2012". The peak temperatures and areas in parallel experiments were reproduced with inaccuracy lower than 3%. The kinetic parameters determination was based on Kissinger formula [26]  in linearized form:1  T    = 1  E    ·  R ln  b  T  2     −  R  E    ln  AR  E        where T is the temperature with maximum reaction rate; b – the heating rate, dps; E - activation energy; A - preexponential factor. The examples of the formula application to topochemical processes can be found elsewhere [27–29] . Electron-microscopic analysis was carried out on electron microscope JEOL JSM-6510LV. X-ray energy-dispersive analyzer was used to register X-rays at element spectrum plotting in selected sample surface areas. The inaccuracy in element content determination was equal to±0.2%.  3 Discussion Eu2 (SO4 )3 ·8H2 O thermal dehydratation in argon flow ( Fig. 1 a,  Table 2 ) proceeds in one step despite of crystallohydrate inequivalency of water molecules in the compound. The mass loss is well related to loss of all 8 water molecules according to reaction:(2) Eu2 (SO4 )3 ·8H2 O → Eu2 (SO4 )3  + 8H2 O↑    The dehydratation onset temperature is equal to 97.0 °С. The complete dehydratation takes place over the temperature range of 97.0–153.2 °С. The dehydratation enthalpy, which was calculated from peak area is equal to − 139.4 kJ/mol. Eu2 (SO4 )3 ·8H2 O thermal dehydratation in constant air atmosphere (Fig. 1 b) also proceeds in one step, however, nature of DSC curve indicates that crystallohydrate water molecules are inequival to each other. The dehydratation takes place over the temperature range of 98.4–179.6 °С. The dehydratation enthalpy is equal − 142.7 kJ/mol. In both cases shown in Fig. 1 , the low-intensity heat development peaks were registered where sample mass variation was not observed. To evaluate the reason for the effects, the isothermal exposures of europium sulfate octahydrate at T = 200 and 500 °С were implemented. In both the cases, mass losses are conformal to complete dehydratation of Eu2 (SO4 )3 ·8H2 O. According to XRD analysis and electron-microscopic results ( Fig. 2 ), the sample heated to 200 °С is classified as X-ray amorphous powder. The sample heated to 500 °С is identified as a polycrystalline anhydrous europium (III) sulfate. Consequently, the appearance of heat development peaks in thermogramms was caused by crystallization of X-ray-amorphous anhydrous europium sulfate phase, which was formed by complete dehydratation of octahydrate. In both cases, the values of crystallization enthalpy are similar ( Table 3 ). The thermal decomposition of anhydrous europium (III) sulfate in Ar atmosphere ( Fig. 3 a) proceeds by two steps:(3) Eu2 (SO4 )3  → Eu2 O2 SO4  + 2SO2  + O2    (4) 2Eu2 O2 SO4  → 2Eu2 O3  + 2SO2  + O2     It can be assumed that anhydrous europium (III) sulfate thermal decomposition takes place according to the reaction scheme:(5) Eu2 (SO4 )3  → Eu2 O(SO4 )2  → Eu2 O2 SO4     However, the two-step process can be observed only on DSC curve recorded in the air atmosphere (Fig. 3 b). It can be concluded that oxygen presence in air resulted in the decomposition process retardation with emission of more oxygen and it induced the decomposition process differentiation. Hence, the europium (III) sulfate decomposition proceeds with europium oxydisulfate Eu2 O(SO4 )2  intermediate formation. The decomposition final product is europium dioxysulfate Eu2 O2 SO4 . The DSC curve points on following europium sulfate decomposition process mechanism:(6) Intermediate storage Eu2 (SO4 )3  → Eu2 O(SO4 )2  + SO2  +1 /2 O2    (7) Co-decomposition of initial product and intermediate to stable form Eu2 (SO4 )3  → Eu2 O2 SO4  + 2SO2  + O2    (8) Eu2 O(SO4 )2  → Eu2 O2 SO4  + SO2  + 1 /2 O2     The second peak on DSC curves can be attributed to oxysulfate decomposition, which takes place according the reaction:(9) Eu2 O2 SO4  → Eu2 O3  + SO2  +1 /2 O2     The decomposition proceeds in one step. Europium oxysulfate possesses higher stability in the air atmosphere that is indicated by noticeable decomposition temperature increase. This stability, apparently, is also induced by oxygen presence in the atmosphere. The oxygen is one of the reaction products and its additional formation shifts the equilibrium towards initial products. This factor may support the europium sulfate stability in the air. The reaction enthalpies, determined in this research can be correlated with the values ( Table 4 ). The kinetics of the europium sulfate octahydrate thermal decomposition was carried out under different heating rates: 3, 5, 10 и 15 °С/min. The europium (III) sulfate octahydrate thermal decomposition kinetic parameters were calculated based on DTA data recorded at different heating rates ( Table 5 ). The relation of heat-absorption efficiency maximum peak temperature with heating rate is linear. The energy activation barrier highly increases on passing from crystallohydrate dehydratation (Еа  = 71 kJ/mol) to decomposition processes of sulfates Eu2 (SO4 )3  (Еа  = 303 kJ/mol) and Eu2 O2 SO4  (Еа  = 400 kJ/mol), although it is partly compensated by preexponential factor increase. This indicates kinetic complexity of sulfate disrupture high-temperature processes in comparison with dehydratation and, on DSC-curves, it is shown up as a significant peak enlargement. Such relation can be used for characterization and forecasting of comparative simplicity of multistage process behavior of single stages in the plan of kinetic mechanism identification ( Fig. 4 ). The thermal decomposition of EuSO4 in argon flow proceeds in two steps, as evident from  Fig. 5 a. The first step corresponds to the EuSO4  decomposition up to oxysulfate EuO·3EuSO4 . The formation of similar oxysulfates is common in the case of decomposition of vitriol like compounds (FeSO4 , CuSO4 , CoSO4  etc.) [30–33] . The inert atmosphere is conductive to divalent state stabilization:(10) 4EuSO4  → 3EuSO4 ·EuO + SO2  + 1 /2 O2     The second step can be described by reaction scheme:(11) 2(EuO·3EuSO4 ) → 4Eu2 O2 SO4  + S + SO2     The decomposition enthalpies on the steps are equals 48.9 kJ/mol и 75.4 kJ/mol, respectively. The third peak on DSC-curve corresponds to europium oxysulfate decomposition. In the air atmosphere (Fig. 5 b), europium (II) sulfate is more stable and it decomposes in one step according to the following reaction:(12) 2EuSO4  → Eu2 O2 SO4  + SO2     The europium (II) sulfate decomposition enthalpy on air is approximately equals to sum of enthalpies of two decomposition steps in inert atmosphere ΔН = 123.8 kJ/mol. The second peak on DSC-curve corresponds to europium oxysulfate decomposition. The thermal and thermodynamic characteristics of europium oxysulfate decomposition are the same as those in case of oxysulfate decomposition which was formed as a result of europium (III) sulfate thermal decomposition. Consequently, having average values of reactions enthalpies, it is possible to compose the thermochemical reaction schemes:(13) Eu2 (SO4 )3 ·8H2 O (monoclinic)  → Eu2 (SO4 )3 (monoclinic)  + 8H2 O (gas) ; ΔH° = 141·1 kJ/mol   (14) Eu2 (SO4 )3 (monoclinic)  → Eu2 O2 SO4 (rhombic)  + 2SO2 (gas)  + O2 (gas) ; ΔH° = 463·1 kJ/mol   (15) Eu2 O2 SO4 (rhombic)  → Eu2 O3 (cubic)  + SO2 (gas)  + 1 /2 O2 (gas) ; ΔH° = 378·4 kJ/mol   (16) 2EuSO4 (rhombic)  → Eu2 O2 SO4 (rhombic)  + SO2 (gas) ; ΔH° = 124·1 kJ/mol    The europium sulfates formation enthalpies were calculated from thermochemical equations with use of information materials of binary compounds formation enthalpies and enthalpies collected in this research. The calculation was carried out in series: ΔH°f  (Eu2 O2 SO4 ) by reaction 15, ΔH°f  (Eu2 (SO4 )3 ) by reaction 14, ΔH°f  (Eu2 (SO4 )3 ·8H2 O) by reaction 13, ΔH°f  (EuSO4 ) by reaction 14 (  Tables 6 and 7 ). There is no information about Eu2 (SO4 )3  and Eu2 O2 SO4  formation enthalpies. The paper [37]  contain the following values of europium sulfates formation enthalpies: ΔH°f (Eu2 (SO4 )3 ·8H2 O) = − 6139 kJ/mol, ΔH°f (EuSO4 ) = − 1471 kJ/mol. The indicated data were obtained by dissolution calorimetry method. The data for EuSO4  were obtained by calorimetric researches of dissolution in sulfurous solutions. Unfortunately, solution processes (especially in acidic solutions) are conjugated with a vast amount of equilibria, which influence is very hard or even impossible to account. Also, the accuracy and repeatability of data carried out by applying DSC in comparison to dissolution calorimetry with use of Beckmann thermometer should not be overlooked. In reference with the above, the data collected in this research should be considered as more accurate.  4 Conclusion In this work, usage of simultaneous thermal analysis method allowed to calculate a considerable amount of energy and kinetic characteristics for a broad range of inter-related processes. The reasons of appearance of exothermic effects not accompanied with sample mass variation were elucidated by combining DSC, X-ray phase analysis and electron microscopy methods. Influence of atmosphere type on europium sulfates stability was also studied. The compounds which decompose with oxygen emission are more stable in air atmosphere. The inert atmosphere is conductive to europium divalent state stabilization in the intermediate compound formation at europium (II) sulfate thermal decomposition. For the europium (III) sulfate octahydrate dehydratation processes, the atmosphere type is insignificant. All data collected in present experiment are of fundamental importance, and, also, they can be useful for researchers who work with materials related to europium sulfates.    References [1] C.

                  The co-solvent effect of the three solvents, ethlyene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), and diethylene carbonate (DEC) on the composite electrolytes (CE) consisting of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polytetramethlyene glycol-based waterborne polyurethane [WPU(PTMG)] was investigated by using a mixture design approach. The conductivity data at temperatures of 5, 25, 45 and 65°C were fitted by employing a forward stepwise regression procedure. Unfortunately, as a result of negligible conductivity of EC at T
                     m (∼40°C), the test statistics gave values for R
                     2
                     adj as 0.69 and 0.71 for the regression equations at 5 and 25°C, respectively. The regression equations at 45 and 65°C were used to construct contour plots which facilitated the comparison of synergistic/antagonistic effects among the selected solvents. Molecular simulation was also made on the basis of the radius distribution function. The results obtained are used to interpret the results through contour plots and also using the physical properties of the solvents.

Co-solvent effect on conductivity of composite electrolytes comprising polyethylene oxide and polytetramethylene glycol-based waterborne polyurethane via a mixture design approach Ten-Chin Wen *  Hwang-Shin Tseng  Zhao-Bin Lu  Department of Chemical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan  * Corresponding author. Tel.: +886-6-275-7575, ext. 62656; fax: +886-6-234-4496      The co-solvent effect of the three solvents, ethlyene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), and diethylene carbonate (DEC) on the composite electrolytes (CE) consisting of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polytetramethlyene glycol-based waterborne polyurethane [WPU(PTMG)] was investigated by using a mixture design approach. The conductivity data at temperatures of 5, 25, 45 and 65°C were fitted by employing a forward stepwise regression procedure. Unfortunately, as a result of negligible conductivity of EC at T m  (∼40°C), the test statistics gave values for R 2 adj  as 0.69 and 0.71 for the regression equations at 5 and 25°C, respectively. The regression equations at 45 and 65°C were used to construct contour plots which facilitated the comparison of synergistic/antagonistic effects among the selected solvents. Molecular simulation was also made on the basis of the radius distribution function. The results obtained are used to interpret the results through contour plots and also using the physical properties of the solvents.   Keywords Composite electrolyte  Ionic conductivity  Co-solvent  Waterborne polyurethane  Polyethylene oxide  Mixture design    1 Introduction Solid polymer electrolytes have attracted considerable attention because of their potential applications in batteries, especially in lithium polymer batteries [1–4] . Polyethylene oxide (PEO) was earlier reported as the host matrix with a variety of inorganic salts having low-lattice energy [5–9] . Specifically, the LiX–PEO systems had low temperature conductivity as a result of formation of the partially crystalline polymer–salt complex. In recent reports [10,11] , room temperature ionic conductivities of the order of 10−3  S/cm have been achieved by suitable incorporation of polar solvents and lithium salts into the amorphous polymer matrix. In another modified method, plasticizers are introduced into polymers with high mechanical strength such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN) [12–14] , polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) [15,16] , and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) [17,18]  to produce polymer electrolyte matrixes of a different kind. In these systems, the ions mainly move in the plasticizer domain and the polymer merely serves as a host matrix. In this context, the use of mixed solvents can have the additional advantages in the construction of batteries. The use of mixed aprotic solvents gives higher conductivity than a single solvent. A large number of studies have been reported on the changes in conductivities while using mixed aprotic solvents [19–22] . It was known that the use of ethylene carbonate (EC) has many desirable properties for use as an electrolyte solvent for lithium batteries in comparison with propylene carbonate (PC) because EC has a higher dielectric constant and lower viscosity than PC. In our previous paper [23] , the PEO–WPU (PTMG) based electrolytes were reported to possess both good ion conductivity and mechanical strength. In this study, three solvents, PC, EC, and diethylene carbonate (DEC) were used for incorporation into the PEO–WPU (PTMG) electrolyte to investigate the co-solvent effect on conductivity. The possible solvation between lithium ions and various solvents was also investigated through molecular simulation which can be used to interpret the changes in conductivity. The mixture design approach [24–27]  as employed earlier in our laboratory; is now extended to multicomponent system. The experimental region is represented by a regular simplex. Since the sum of the component proportions is unity, the region is taken as a triangle. The experimental region is explored at a point of composition corresponding to an ordered arrangement. The mixture design method assumes that the conductivity (σ ) is a function of its component (LiClO4 –PC, LiClO4 –EC and LiClO4 –DEC) compositions. This relationship can be expressed asσ=f  (x1 , x2 , x3 )   where x 1 , x 2  and x 3  indicate the molar proportions of PC, EC and DEC, respectively, in the PEO–WPU(PTMG) based composite electrolyte.  2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of waterborne polyurethane (WPU) The raw materials employed in this study are listed in Table 1  . Polytetramethylene glycol (PTMG) was dried and degassed under vacuum at 70°C for 2 days. Dimethylol propionic acid (DMPA) was dried under vacuum at 120°C and then dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), distilled from anhydrous MgSO4  at low pressure and stored over 3-Å molecular sieves until use. Acetone was also dried by distilling over P2 O5  and stored over 3-Å molecular sieves until use. All other chemicals were used without any further treatment. An outline of our modified acetone process [25,28,29]  used in this study for preparation of PTMG based WPU noted as WPU(PTMG) dispersion is shown in Scheme 1  . To a 1000-ml four-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with an anchor-propeller stirrer of 7 cm in length and 2 cm in width, with a nitrogen inlet and outlet and a thermometer, PTMG (72 g, 0.072 mol) and DMPA/NMP (0.954 g/2.436 g) were charged under nitrogen gas atmosphere. Isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) (26.347 g) was then slowly added over a period of 10 min with gentle stirring (200 rpm). The mixture was then heated to 80–85°C until the theoretical NCO content of the prepolymer was reached. This was determined by the di-n -butylamine titration method [30] . The final NCO-terminated PU prepolymer solutions were adjusted to acetone:PU ratios of 3.65 by the addition of a suitable amount of acetone. LiOH (0.205 g), a neutralizing agent, and an ethylenediamine-based chain extender bearing sulfonate groups in aqueous solution (8.275 g, see preparation of chain extender ) were added immediately to the freshly prepared NCO-terminated PU prepolymer solution. The resulting mixture was then heated at the phase-inversion temperature (50°C) for 10 min to yield the PU anionomers in acetone. There exists a possibility for branching in the polymer structure which would arise from the multiplicity of reaction paths because of the use of the chain extender. The low and constant effective concentration maintained for the chain extender during the preparation would produce a polymer with similar properties that could then be used for studying the solvent effect. Double distilled water (≈232 g) was then added to the neutralized PU anionmer solutions at an agitation rate and water addition rate of 350 rpm and 2.0 ml/min, respectively. An aqueous dispersion of ∼30 wt.% solids was obtained on removal of acetone by rotary vacuum evaporation.  2.2 Preparation of the chain extender Ethylenediamine (6.0 g, 0.1 mol) was added dropwise to a solution of butane sultone, C2 H4 N2 H4−x  [(CH2 )4 SO3 Li] (13.6 g, 0.1 mol) and H2 O (25 g). The resulting mixture was heated at 80–85°C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature after which LiOH (2.4 g, 0.1 mol) was then added.  2.3 Preparation of PEO aqueous solution The aqueous solution of PEO was prepared by dissolving PEO powder (average molecular weight 4×105 , Aldrich) in doubly distilled water and then slowly stirred for 24 h.  2.4 Preparation of the composite electrolytes WPU(PTMG)–PEO film was prepared by adding the aqueous solution of PEO to the WPU dispersion, casting on PTFE disk and then drying at 100°C under vacuum for 3 days. Finally, the film was transferred into an argon filled dry box (Vacuum Atmosphere, USA) for assembling the cell. Lithium perchlorate (Aldrich) was dissolved in propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethylene carbonate (DEC) to form 1.0 M LiClO4 –PC, 1.0 M LiClO4 –EC, and 1.0 M LiClO4 –DEC solutions in the dry box. The three solutions were mixed in the desired proportion according to the design matrix in Table 2   to form sixteen solutions. The WPU(PTMG)–PEO composite electrolytes were prepared by dipping dried films in sixteen solutions (see Table 2 ) which were preweighed to have the desired 50% (w/o) liquid electrolyte in CEs.  2.5 Conductivity measurement The conductivities of the composite electrolytes were measured via impedance analysis with an electrochemical cell consisting of the electrolyte film sandwiched between two blocks of stainless steel, sealed with an O-ring in a tube and covered with a heating/cooling water circulation jacket. Temperature of the cell was controlled using a thermostat (Haake D8 and G) and calibrated using PT-100 thermocouple. The impedance analysis was performed from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz by using CMS300 EIS system (Gamry Instruments, USA) with an SR810 DSP lock-in amplifier (Standford Research Systems, USA) under an oscillation potential of 10 mV.   3 Results and discussion 3.1 AC impedance Co-solvents have commercial importance and the PEO–WPU(PTMG) composite electrolyte (CE) was reported to possess a high conductivity at room temperature [23] . The effect of LiClO4  solutions in the combined PC–EC–DEC ternary solvents on the conductivity of CE was investigated here by using the mixture design strategy. The ionic conductivity can be obtained by performing AC impedance measurements. The AC impedance measurements of these CEs with 50% 1 M LiClO4  in PC–EC–DEC sandwiched between stainless steel (SS) electrodes were carried out. Fig. 1   shows the typical Nyquist plots with an equivalent circuit for the CEs swelled with 50% 1.0 M LiClO4 –PC solution at 25 or 45°C. The profiles show a straight line in the high frequency region that could be simulated by an equivalent circuit of charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) and double-layer capacitor (C d ) parallel to each other and bulk resistance (R b ) in series. The mathematics for impedance (Z ) of this equivalent circuit can be expressed as(1) Z= Rb  +Rct   1+(Rct  ωd   )2      − R2 ct  ωCd   1+(Rct  ωCd  )2      j   where ω  is the angular frequency and j  represents the imaginary part of Z . Considering the factor in the denominator of Eq. (1) , the order of magnitude of this dimensionless group, R ct ωC d , in comparison to unity plays an important role in analyzing the physical system. According to engineering viewpoint, there are two extreme cases: (a) when R ct ωC d ≫1, then Z →R b , while (b) when R ct ωC d ≪1, then Z →R b +R ct . In this study, since the charge-transfer reaction is extremely difficult to occur under the oscillation potential at SS electrodes, the factor R ct C d  becomes too large to locate the R b +R ct . The straight line represents the response of a C d  parallel to a large R ct . Thus, on increasing ω , the straight line gives the intercept in the real axis which was used to find R b .  3.2 Conductivity analysis 3.2.1 (i) Unitary solvent The conductivity (σ ) value was calculated using R b  obtained from AC impedance employing σ =(1/R b )(l /A ), where l  and A  represent film thickness and surface area of an electrode, respectively. The lines 1–3 in Fig. 2   represent the Arrhenius plots of σ  for CEs containing of unitary solvent, PC, EC, and DEC, respectively. It is clear that σ  of CEs containing 50% (w/o) 1 M LiClO4  in PC and DEC obeys Arrhenius law and exhibits a straight line (lines 1 and 3) with activation energy (E a ) for CE1 and CE3 as 13.18 kJ/mol and 40.30 kJ/mol, respectively. This implies that the conductive environment of Li+  in CE1 and CE3 are all liquid-like and remain unchanged in the temperature region of investigation. However, CE3 is more sensitive to temperature and possesses the lower conductivity than CE1. This can be ascribed to the higher dielectric constant (ϵ ) of PC compared with DEC (list in Table 3  ), rendering more dissociation of LiClO4  in PC. On the other hand, CE containing 50% (w/o) 1 M LiClO4  in EC (CE2), gives Arrhenius plot with a two-segmental line (line 2) separated by a transition at 35–40°C, probably arising from T m  of EC (40°C). For temperatures >40°C, CE2 has slightly higher conductivity than CE1 due to its higher ϵ . On the other hand for temperatures <35°C, σ  of CE2 becomes very sensitive to temperature (E a =90.01 kJ/mol) and decreases with decreasing temperature. From the foregoing analysis, it seems that unitary solvent, especially EC and DEC, is not suitable to be used alone for room temperature applications.  3.2.2 (ii) Binary solvent The conductivity data (σ ) at various temperatures are listed together with the design matrix in Table 2 . σ  at 25°C(σ 25 ) for binary solvent is considered for discussion at the first instant. For PC–EC binary system, it is clear from Fig. 3  that there exists no obvious synergistic/antagonistic effect at 25°C. The largest peak for σ  appearing at 75% of EC is attributed to the addition of PC, which may have influences on reducing the T m  of EC. For DEC–EC binaries, a peak in σ  occurred at 75% of EC as shown in Fig. 3  . These two results reveal that the addition of a solvent with a low T m  (PC or DEC) to a solvent with high T m  and ϵ  (EC) will decrease its T m  and consequently can result in high room temperature conductivity. The PC–DEC binaries show the synergistic effect as shown in Fig. 4   as a result of mixing of the solvents with high and low having T m  values lower than room temperature (T m =−49°C for PC, −43°C for DEC [31] ).  3.2.3 (iii) Ternary solvent In order to investigate the ternary system at different temperatures, σ  data in Table 2  were fitted with a forward stepwise regression procedure to generate the following regression equations with statistical significance.(2) σ5 = 60.16x1 +51.56x2 +378.45x1 x2 −6 122 219.73x1 x2 x3 −940.28x1 x2 (x1 −x2 )   (50.43)    (50.43)  (253.26)  (2 637 199.73)   (556.71)   +6 132 527.72x1 2 x2 x3 +6 133 261.91x1 x2 2 x3 +6 116 947.53x1 x2 x3 2     (2 638 780.71)   (1 638 780.71)   (2 638 555.86)   R2 =0.84, R2 adj  =0.69      (3) σ25 = 211.25x1 +152.38x2 +457.209x1 x2 +30 038.66x1 x2 2 x3 −15 268.80×1 x2 x3 2    (91.68)  (93.33)  (488.03)   (11 774.42)   (11 106.91)   R2 =0.80, R2 adj  =0.71      (4) σ45 = 450.7x1 +439.6x2 +1227.8x1 x2 −2065.7x1 x2 (x1 −x2 )+14 875.7x1 x2 2 x3    (154.2)  (155.4)  (781.0)   (1578.5)     (13 727.6)   R2 =0.87, R2 adj  =0.81      (5) σ65 = 629.6x1 +796.2x2 +1099.9x1 x2 −2467.0x1 x2 (x1 −x2 )+33 166.9x1 2 x2 x3    (186.7)  (185.2)  (938.2)   (1896.2)     (16 490.4)   R2 =0.93, R2 adj  =0.90      where x 1 , x 2  and x 3 , respectively, represent the volume proportion of 1.0 M LiClO4  in PC, EC, and DEC, as well as the subscripts of σ  (5, 25, 45, 65) indicate the measured temperatures in degrees Celsius. The numbers in parenthesis below the coefficients are their standard errors based on error variance estimates. The analysis of variance of conductivities are summarized in Tables 4–7     . The test statistics, F  and R 2 adj , are defined asF=MSR/MSE , R2 adj  =1−[SSE /(N−P)]/[SST /(N−1)]   where MSR is the mean square of regression obtained by dividing the sum of squares of regression with the degree of freedom. MSE represents mean square error from the analysis of variance. If the calculated F  value is greater than the table F  (P −1, n , 1−α ) value, a statistically significant regression model is obtained, where n  is the degree of freedom of error and P  is the number of parameters. F  (P −1, n , 1−α ) is the F  value at the aprobability level. R 2 adj  is the adjusted correlation coefficient (R 2 ), with a value close to 1 forming a perfect fit to the experimental data. The regression Eqs. (2–5)  were used in constructing the contour plots on the compositional diagram of solvents (PC–EC–DEC) against conductivity at 5, 25, 45 and 65°C, respectively (Figs. 5–8     ). These contour lines facilitate a straightforward examination of the dependence of σ  on the composition of binary (PC–EC, PC–DEC, and DEC–EC) and ternary (PC–EC–DEC) solvents. However, the contour plots at 5 and 25°C shown in Figs. 5 and 6 , respectively, are only used here for comparison due to their insignificant statistics, R adj 2 =0.69 and 0.71. The insignificant regression equations at 5 and 25°C can be explained by the fact that the lowest σ  for the pure EC exists at the point X 2 . The sharp increase in σ  occurs thereafter due to the addition of PC in EC, resulting the discontinuity in σ  data at the surrounding point of X 2 . Although Figs 5 and 6  are not statistically significant, their maximum σ  values appear for the ternary region (x 1 =0.3, x 2 =0.5 and x 3 =0.2), give a clue that the ternary solvent provides the better CE environment for the movement of ions than the unitary/binary solvent. This can also be explained from the physical properties of solvents. From the above discussion about binary solvent at 25°C (Figs. 3 and 4 ), the addition of PC/DEC to EC makes higher room temperature conductivity due to the decrease in T m  of EC as a consequence of co-solvent effect. Additionally, the effect can manifest from high ϵ  and low viscosity of the ternary mixture. When the temperature was higher than the T m  of EC, R adj 2  values were found as 0.81 and 0.90 through Eqs. (4) and (5)  at 45 and 65°C, respectively. This suggests that the corresponding contour plots are reliable for further discussion. An examination of both Figs. 7 and 8  indicates that both contour plots possess similar trends which are summarized here for simplicity as follows: (i) the minimum σ  occurs at point X 3  (pure DEC) and (ii) the maximum σ  appears in the ternary region nearer to line X 1 −X 2  (binaries PC–EC). However, there exists still a discrepancy. At 45°C, point X 2  showed larger σ  than point X 1  whilst at 65°C, the opposite result was noticed. This can also be explained by the physical properties of the solvents. The closeness of T m  of EC to 45°C may be the reason for the former result. The later result can be the outcome of larger ϵ  for EC than PC (95.3 vs. 64.4). In fact, the solvation of salt by solvent might be another important reason that would determine the ionic conductivity and this can be evident from the molecular simulation.   3.3 Molecular simulation In order to further interpret the co-solvent effect, the molecular simulation for radius distribution function, G(r ), was performed by using a simulation software (discover  Biosym/MSI, USA). Fig. 9   indicates the G(r ) vs. r , where r  is the distance between Li+  and carbonyl oxygen of solvent. G(r ) is defined as(6) G (r)=D(r)/Dave     where D (r ) is the density of the molecular numbers of distance, r , and D ave  is the density of molecular numbers of overall space. An examination of Fig. 9  reveals that the maximum probability of distance between Li+  and carbonyl oxygen of PC and EC occurs at 3 Å (peak a1 and peak b1), which can be reasonably explained by their similarity in ring structure. On the other hand, the maximum probability of distance between Li+  and carbonyl oxygen of DEC appears at two sites, 2.7 and 7.8 Å (peak c1 and peak c2) which may be due to the presence of alkyl chain and lower ϵ  associated with DEC. It is conceivable that DEC dissociate LiClO4  by a double layer model, resulting in two maximum peaks. The reason for lower conductivity for the solution containing LiClO4  and DEC may be viewed due to the large lithium ion cluster with the double layer of DEC. However, the probable ion pair formation could not be simulated and identified by the computational procedure adopted in this work. The above discussion suggests that both the physical properties of solvents and the molecular simulation can adequately be explained using contour plots. The role of PEO–WPU(PTMG) can be ignored due to the formation of PEO–LiClO4 –PC liquid complex as discussed in our previous paper [23] .   4 Conclusion Using a mixture design strategy, a model is proposed containing σ  at various temperatures and compositions of co-solvent (PC–EC–DEC) using a limited number of experiments. The coefficients of the regression models are represented as contour plots which are extremely useful in studying the co-solvent effects on σ . The molecular simulation results coupled with the physical properties of solvents are used in explaining the contour plots. In conclusion, the composition of the ternary solvent with PC=30%, EC=50%, and DEC=20%, can preferentially be used for all operating temperature ranges.

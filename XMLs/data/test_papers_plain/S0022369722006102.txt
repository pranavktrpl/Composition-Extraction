                  Systematic study employing first-principle electronic structure method along with the evolutionary structure search algorithm as implemented in the universal structure predictor evolutionary Xtallography (USPEX) code has been carried out to look for the possibility of synthesising the ternary hydride (ThxNbyHz) from constituent's thorium, niobium and hydrogen. Our study suggests that the ternary hydride with formula ThNb2H12 will be globally stable above 12.5 GPa indicating the possibility of its formation from constituents Th, Nb, H and binary compounds of Th-H and Nb-H. Further, though the global stability of this compound is predicted to be beyond 12.5 GPa, it is metastable at 0 GPa. We have theoretically explored different formation routes to synthesize this compound. The zero-pressure monoclinic structure (Cm) of metastable ThNb2H12 undergoes a transformation to hexagonal structure (P6/mmm) at 3.5 GPa and this hexagonal structure (P6/mmm) transforms to other hexagonal type structure (P6/m) at 50 GPa. The high pressure structural sequence so predicted through static lattice calculations has been further substantiated by confirming the elastic and lattice dynamic stability of each structure in the pressure regime of their stability. Employing Allen–Dynes modified McMillan [P. B. Allen and R. C. Dynes, Phys. Rev. B 12, 905 (1975)] formula along with the fixed Coulomb pseudopotential of 0.1 and calculated electron-phonon coupling parameter, the superconductive temperature has also been calculated for this compound. Our analysis indicates that this material will behave as superconductor with transition temperature (Tc) ∼ 25 K at 15 GPa, which, will reduce to 4 K upon further compression to 100 GPa. Our analysis on lattice thermal conductivity of this compound in P6/mmm phase, at 15 GPa, shows a significantly large anisotropy in conductivity tensor, especially at lower temperatures.

Systematic study employing first-principle electronic structure method along with the evolutionary structure search algorithm as implemented in the universal structure predictor evolutionary Xtallography (USPEX) code has been carried out to look for the possibility of synthesising the ternary hydride (Thx Nby Hz ) from constituent's thorium, niobium and hydrogen. Our study suggests that the ternary hydride with formula ThNb2 H12  will be globally stable above 12.5 GPa indicating the possibility of its formation from constituents Th, Nb, H and binary compounds of Th-H and Nb-H. Further, though the global stability of this compound is predicted to be beyond 12.5 GPa, it is metastable at 0 GPa. We have theoretically explored different formation routes to synthesize this compound. The zero-pressure monoclinic structure (Cm) of metastable ThNb2 H12  undergoes a transformation to hexagonal structure (P6/mmm) at 3.5 GPa and this hexagonal structure (P6/mmm) transforms to other hexagonal type structure (P6/m) at 50 GPa. The high pressure structural sequence so predicted through static lattice calculations has been further substantiated by confirming the elastic and lattice dynamic stability of each structure in the pressure regime of their stability. Employing Allen–Dynes modified McMillan [P. B. Allen and R. C. Dynes, Phys. Rev. B 12, 905 (1975)] formula along with the fixed Coulomb pseudopotential of 0.1 and calculated electron-phonon coupling parameter, the superconductive temperature has also been calculated for this compound. Our analysis indicates that this material will behave as superconductor with transition temperature (Tc ) ∼ 25 K at 15 GPa, which, will reduce to 4 K upon further compression to 100 GPa. Our analysis on lattice thermal conductivity of this compound in P6/mmm phase, at 15 GPa, shows a significantly large anisotropy in conductivity tensor, especially at lower temperatures.

After H.K. Onnes observed superconductivity in Mercury (Hg) in 1911, room-temperature superconductivity has been a long dream and a field of intensive research. According to the BCS theory, the superconducting transition temperature of a material is proportional to its Debye temperature [1 ]. This suggests that hydrogen is the first, simplest, and most common chemical element in the Universe, would be an ideal room-temperature superconductor after metallization [2 ] and E. Winger and H. B. Huntington theoretically predicted in 1935 that solid metal hydrogen can be obtained under high pressure conditions [3 ]. However, experimental studies have shown that hydrogen requires extremely high pressures for metallization [4 ,5 ]. By adding dopant elements, it is possible to give hydrogen a “chemical pre-compression” effect, enabling the metallization of hydrogen-rich compounds at much lower pressures than with pure hydrogen [6 ]. Using this technique, many excellent hydrogen-rich compounds have been designed and predicted to be potential high-temperature superconductors in last decade [7–9 ]. Some of these have been synthesized experimentally also. For example, H3 S and LaH10  have been first predicted to have superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) exceeding 200 K [10–12 ], which was later, confirmed experimentally [13–16 ]. With the additional degrees of freedom made possible by expanding the chemical space available, ternary hydrides have been receiving growing interest as means both to increase Tc and to enhance stability over a broader pressure range. Incorporating a new element into binary hydrides to form ternary hydrides appears to be an important way of enhancing pressure range and increasing the superconducting transition temperature. For example, Li2 MgH16  with the highest Tc to date (473 K at 250 GPa), has been designed by introducing extra electrons (Li element) to fill the antibonding orbital of the H2  molecular units of MgH16  [17 ]. Later a compound of hydrogen, carbon and sulphur was reported to show superconducting transition temperature of 288 K at 267 GPa [18 ], but, the stoichiometry and crystal structure of the compound is yet to be determined. In fact, that experimental study itself is still a subject of many controversies [19–21 ]. Although, the Tc of Li2 MgH16  and C-S-H compound can reach to room temperature, the requirement of extreme pressures of more than 250 GPa make it quite difficult to use these materials in practical application. Recently, a new class of fluorite-type clathrate ternary hydrides AXH8  (A = Ca, Sr, Y, La, X = B, Be, Al) has been theoretically synthesized [22 ] and examined for their superconductive properties. LaBeH8,  a hydride of this class has been reported to display outstanding properties with dynamic stability down to 20 GPa and a high Tc ∼ 185 K. Thorium belonging to the actinide series, is a weak radioactive element with its most stable isotope 232 Th having a half-life of 14 billion years. Further, similar to transition metals Ti, Hf, or Zr its physical and chemical properties are mainly decided by d  electrons [23 ]. At ambient conditions, bulk thorium has fcc structure (Fm 3ˉm  space group) which is in contrast to other elements of actinide series stabilizing in lower symmetry structures [24 ]. Also, it displays a weak conventional (phonon-mediated) type-I superconductivity with TC  = 1.374 K [24 ,25 ]. Thorium reacts with hydrogen to form hydrides ThH2  and Th4 H15 , the latter being the first known superconducting hydride with metallic conductivity at ambient pressure and superconducting TC  = 7.5–8 K [26 ,27 ]. However, at high pressure of 100 GPa the higher hydrogen concentration thorium hydrides ThH10  with space group symmetry Fm 3ˉm  has been reported to show the highest Tc ranging from 165 to 195 K [28 ]. As compared to thorium, the transition metal Nb is well known to exhibit superconductivity with higher Tc (9.3 K) at normal pressure [30 ]. As far as hydrides of this metal are concerned, several poly hydrides such as Nb4 H3 , NbH, NbH2 , NbH2.5  and NbH3  have been successfully synthesized and characterised up to 100 GPa using in-situ x-ray diffraction (XRD) in laser heated diamond anvil cell (DAC) experiments [30 ,31 ]. Further, in these studies authors also have predicted the superconductive nature of NbH, NbH2  and other niobium hydride through theoretical simulations [30 ,31 ]. Though, the high superconducting temperatures have been reported in some hydrides but the corresponding pressures are very high, so the pursuit for high-Tc  superconductivity in hydrides at low pressure or at ambient pressure still remains a challenging area. The above mentioned interesting research works [26–31 ] on hydrides to explore the possibility of finding high Tc superconductors has prompted us to explore the possibility of synthesising the ternary compounds containing thorium niobium and hydrogen; and examining the structural and superconductive property employing evolutionary structural search method combined with first principle theoretical calculations.  2 Theoretical method New ternary Thx  Nby  Hz  compounds with variable stoichiometry have been searched at 0 GPa, 25 GPa, 50 GPa and 100 GPa using the evolutionary structure prediction method USPEX [32–34 ]. At each pressure, two independent ternary searches have been performed with 4–11 atoms/unit cell and 6–16 atoms/unit cell to increase the probability of finding structures with nontrivial composition. Due to the complexity of the ternary search, binary structure searches have also been performed with stoichiometries varying between thorium and hydrogen; (Th)x  + Hy , between niobium and hydrogen; (Nb)x  + Hy  as well as (Th)x  and (Nb)y . The binary searches used 8–20 atoms/unit-cell. By ensuring that the binary and ternary structure searches find the same structures, we prove that complex ternary search covers the entire chemical landscape and does not miss any potentially important stoichiometries. After the ternary and binary variable composition searches have been completed, fixed composition structure searches have been performed for stoichiometries with larger number of atoms (up to 40 atoms/unit cell) to find the lowest enthalpy phases for each stoichiometry. During the structure search, the cell parameters and the atomic coordinates of each structure are varied to minimize the total enthalpy at a given pressure using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [35 ] within density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in VASP [36 ]. For the structure search, projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials [37 ] and plane wave basis sets are used with an energy cutoff of 600 eV. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) pseudopotential having valence configurations of 6s2 6p6 6d1 5f1 7s2  for Th, 4p6 4d4 5s1  for Nb and 1s1  for H has been used. In Th, the cut off radius of the PAW is chosen to be 2.8 Bohr for 7s, 6s, 6d and 5f orbitals and 2.5 Bohr for 6p orbitals. The cut off radius in Nb is taken to be 2.6 Bohr for 4p and 4d and 2.7 Bohr for 5s orbitals. The cut off radius in H is taken to be 1.1 Bohr. The Monkhorst–Pack (MP) [38 ] k-point meshes for different structures have been used to ensure that the enthalpy converges to 1meV/atom. Phonon calculations have been performed by density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [39 ] or by using the supercell method implemented in PHONOPY [40 ] code. The diagonalization of the dynamical matrix constructed from the force constant matrix yielded the phonon frequencies. To determine the displacement pattern and to solve the dynamical matrix, supercells of sizes of 2 × 2 × 2, 2 × 2 × 3 and 2 × 2 × 3 have been used for Cm, P6/mmm and P6/m phases. Electron phonon coupling (EPC) calculations have been carried out with the Quantum-Espresso code [41 ] using ultra soft potentials for all atoms. We used the PHONO3PY [42 ] software package to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity, which utilises the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation with single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA) [42 ]. For phonon thermal conductivity calculation second-and third-order force constants have been determined using the same supercell as described before with finite atomic displacements of 0.03 A0 . The elastic constants of all the three predicted phases, i.e., monoclinic, and two hexagonal phases, have been computed employing the stress-strain method [43 ].  3 RESULTS and DISCUSSION The USPEX [32–34 ] simulation software tool has been used to conduct an unbiased composition search for stable/metastable compositions at pressures of 0 GPa, 25 GPa, 50 GPa, and 100 GPa. To find the minimum pressure for formation of ThNb2 H12  from its constituents (elemental or binary) and to examine its stability up to maximum pressure of 100 GPa, calculations of reaction path have been carried out. For this purpose, first the, stability of Th, Nb, H, and their binary compound systems (Th-H, Nb-H and Th-Nb) has been examined. Though, the high-pressure behaviour of Th, Nb, H, Th-H and Nb-H systems has been well-studied in recent years [28–31 ,44–47 ], the information on the Th-Nb system under pressure is still lacking. We not only examined stability of Th-Nb system but also revisited the other systems, viz., Th, Nb, H, and their binary systems Th-H, Nb-H, for sake of completeness of the investigations. Our simulation for Th-Nb does not produce any stable compound. For Th, our simulation produces cubic Fm-3m at ambient pressure and tetragonal phase with space group (SG) I4/mmm above 70 GPa in line with previous theoretical and experimental studies [44–47 ]. Similarly, for Nb, the bcc phase (Im-3m) has been found to be stable up to 100 GPa, whereas for H2 , the P63 m phase, as suggested by present simulations has been considered as stable structure up to 100 GPa. Further, our structural search on Nb-H and Th-H based binary systems, up to 100 GPa, produced all the predicted [28 ,30 ] as well as experimentally [31 ,47 ] observed phases as shown in Supplementary Information Fig. S1  and Fig. S2 , respectively. For Nb-H system the compositions NbH, NbH2 , Nb4 H3 , NbH3  and NbH2.5  have been investigated for stability. As displayed in Fig. S1 , for the stoichiometric NbH the predicted structure at 0 GPa and 60 GPa is orthorhombic Cccm (Z = 4) and rhombohedral centered hexagonal R-3m (Z = 3), consistent with earlier predictions [30 ,31 ]. For NbH2 , however, the fluorite (Fm-3m) structure is most stable up to 50 GPa (Fig. S1  right top panel) in agreement with the experimental report [48 ]. Upon further compression, beyond 50 GPa, an orthorhombic structure (Pnma, Z = 4) emerges as stable phase. For Nb4 H3  at 0 GPa, in contrast to earlier predicted monoclinic P2 structure (Z = 1) [30 ], we find that the primitive orthorhombic (Pccm) structure is energetically more favoured as its enthalpy is lower (by ∼ 0.021 eV/formula unit) than that of P2, though, lattice dynamically both the phases are stable (Fig. S3 ). Above 70 GPa, Pccm phase was found to transform to a base-centered monoclinic C2/m structure, however, with respect to decomposition into NbH + Nb, the Pccm is stable up to 50 GPa only. This finding is in agreement with the observed NbH off stoichiometry of phases synthesized at ambient pressure [49 ,50 ]. As far as NbH3  is concerned at ambient pressure NbH3  is not stable relative to decomposition into the dihydride, however, above 33 GPa this composition emerges as a stable compound with body-centered cubic (I-43d, Z = 16) structure. Additionally, our evolutionary simulations could also produce the recently discovered stable NbH2.5  composition [26 ] with orthorhombic symmetry (space group Ibam). To construct Nb-H phase diagram, all the above discussed compositions have been considered. Next, for Th-H system the enthalpy of various compositions, viz., ThH2 , ThH4  and Th4 H15  in different crystal structures has been calculated as a function of pressure and shown in Fig. S2 . As depicted in Fig. S2 , ThH2 , which, is stable in tetragonal (I4/mmm) phase at ambient conditions transforms to monoclinic C2/m phase above 60 GPa. In Th4 H15 , the ambient bcc (I-43d) phase transforms to orthorhombic (Pnma) phase around 15 GPa. In case of ThH4  composition it is found that ambient pressure Pnma phase transforms to P321 structure at 15 GPa, which transforms to I4/mmm phase at 85 GPa upon further compression, in line with recent experimental report [33 ]. Our calculations also produced ThH6  composition stable in Cmc21 -phase in the pressure range of 25–90 GPa. Finally, the full pressure-composition phase diagram of both Nb-H and Th-H system is summarized in Fig. 4 . After finding all the stable structures and stable compositions of Th, Nb, H2  and its homologues binaries, we have calculated reaction path for ternary ThNb2 H12  from multiple substances/binaries. The formation enthalpy of ThNb2 H12  with respect to different stable constituents has been evaluated and listed in Table 1   and also plotted in Fig. 1  . It is clear that at 0 GPa, though, ThNb2 H12  is stable with respect to elementary constituents Th, Nb and H2 , it is unstable with respect to binary compositions likeThH2,  Th4 H15,  ThH4  and ThH6  because of its positive enthalpy of formation. But with increase of pressure the situation changes and above 12.5 GPa (Fig. 1 ) the enthalpy of ThNb2 H12  becomes lower than that of all the above discussed binary systems of Th-H and Nb-H, indicating the stability of this ternary composition 12.5 GPa onwards, however, its metastability below this pressure including 0 GPa cannot be ruled out. It may also be inferred from Table 1  and Fig. 1  that this composition will remain stable up to 100 GPa (maximum pressure of investigation) owing to its lowest formation enthalpy with respect to all elemental as well as binary constituents throughout the pressure range of 12.5 GPa–100 GPa. Finally, the full pressure-composition ternary phase diagram of Th-Nb-H system is summarized in Fig. S5 . From the figure of 3D convex hull, it is clear that the predicted ternary hydride ThNb2 H12  at 0 GPa is metastable, whereas at 25 GPa and 100 GPa ThNb2 H12  is stable with respect to decomposition into any unary and binary phases. The compositional search predicts that a single ternary compound having stoichiometry ThNb2 H12  evolves in the pressure range from 12.5 GPa to 100 GPa with a possibility of metastability below 12.5 GPa. The crystal structures of this composition at some specified pressures, viz. 0 GPa, 25 GPa, 50 GPa and 100 GPa have been identified through simulations. Accordingly, existence of a monoclinic structure with space group Cm  has been predicted at 0 GPa. At 25 GPa and 50 GPa the hexagonal phase having two formula units per unit cell with space group P6/mmm  has lowest enthalpy suggesting that this structure will be stable at these pressures. At still high pressure of 100 GPa a hexagonal structure with space group P6/m  having one formula unit per cell exhibits lowest enthalpy. All the stable structures of this composition are as shown in Fig. 2  . To find out the exact transition pressure, more refined calculations done on such structures. The enthalpy of P6/mmm  phase with respect to Cm  structure is plotted as a function of pressure in Fig. 3   (left panel). As evident from the figure, the Cm  to P6/mmm  phase transition occurs at ∼3.5 GPa. On further compression, the P6/mmm  structure transforms to P6/m  phase at 50 GPa Fig. 3  (right panel). While performing calculations on Cm , P6/mmm and P6/m  structures, we have optimized the lattice constants, lattice angles as well as internal parameter at each pressure. The optimum values of these quantities at zero pressure for various phases and corresponding pressures of transition are listed in Table 2  . The volume versus pressure relations (equation of state) for all the predicted phases of ThNb2 H12  are shown in Fig. 4  . The volume discontinuity calculated at Cm→ P6/mmm  transition pressure is 15.5%, indicating the first order nature of this transition with a significantly large volume discontinuity. However, P6/mmm→ P6/m  transition is of nearly second order in nature as negligibly small volume discontinuity is displayed at the transition pressure.  The elastic stability is one of the important parameters to be examined to establish a connection, if any, of the elastic failure with a given phase transition. To understand the structural transitions in terms of elastic stability criteria; the elastic constants have been calculated for all the three phases, i.e.  monoclinic (Cm ) and two hexagonal (P6/mmm, P6/m ) structures at different pressures using stress-strain approach. The elastic constants of ThNb2 H12  at different pressure are displayed in Table 3  . For monoclinic structure through examination of following stability conditions [43 ], we find that the Cm structure is stable elastically in the pressure range of its structural stability:c 11  > 0  c 22  > 0  c 33  > 0  c 44  > 0  c 11  + c 22  + c 33  + 2 ( c 12  + c 13  + c 23   )  > 0 ;    c 55  > 0  c 66  > 0  c 22  + c 33  − 2 c 23  > 0 ;  c 33  c 55  − c 35 2  > 0 ;  c 44  c 66  − c 46 2  > 0 ;  [ c 22  ( c 33  c 55  − c 35 2   )  + 2 c 23  c 25  c 35  − c 23 2  c 55  − c 25 2  c 33   ]  > 0 ;          Similarly, for hexagonal phase the following elastic stability conditions [43 ] have been examined at each pressure and found to be satisfied throughout the pressure range of their stability regime.c 11  > 0  c 33  > 0 ;  c 44  > 0 ;  c 66  > 0 ;  ( c 11  − c 12   )  > 0 ;  ( c 11  + c 33  − 2 c 13   )  > 0 ;    [ 2 ( c 11  + c 12   )  + c 33  + 4 c 13   ]  > 0          All the elastic constants listed in Table 3  for various phases at different pressures meet the above Born–Huang criteria [43 ] throughout their stability regime supporting the outcome of static lattice calculations. Having analyzed the elastic stability of various phases of ThNb2 H12  as a function of pressure, we have attempted to examine the lattice dynamic stability also, as dynamical stability without softening mode plays an important role in stabilizing the structures. For this purpose, we have derived phonon spectrum for all the three phases and plotted in Fig. 5  . It is clear from figure, at 0 GPa and 5 GPa for Cm  phase, at 15 GPa and 25 GPa for P6/mmm  phase and at 60 GPa and 100 GPa for P6/m  phase, all the phonon branches have real frequencies indicating that these phases of ThNb2 H12  are lattice dynamically stable in the pressure regime of their structural stability, and the predicted transition sequence of Cm → P6/mmm→ P6/m  is not driven by phonons. Having established the existence of ThNb2 H12  compound and analyzed the structural stability under pressure, we have attempted to theoretically investigate the superconductive property of ThNb2 H12  as a function of pressure. The superconducting transition temperature Tc at a given pressure has been evaluated using the Allen–Dynes modified McMillan formula [51–53 ] along with the value of μ*, the Coulomb pseudopotential parameter, chosen to be 0.10. The obtained average phonon frequency (ωlog ), electron phonon coupling parameter (λ), electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level (N(Ef )) and Tc at different pressures for different phases of ThNb2 H12  is shown in Table 4  . For P6/mmm  phase the value of Tc at 15 GPa is calculated to be 25 K, which decreases to 10 K at 50 GPa. For P6/m  phase, however, the calculated value of Tc at 75 GPa is 6 K which decreases to 4 K at 100 GPa as shown in Fig. 6  . The highest value of Tc displayed by P6/mmm  phase could be associated to largest value of λ (Fig. 6 ) at 15 GPa. It may also be noted that for both the phases the effect of pressure is to reduce the λ, thereby, reducing the Tc. This is mostly due to phonon modes hardening under compression, while the contributions to λ from whole phonon frequencies are weakened. To get more clear picture of the origin of the superconductivity, we have calculated the frequency dependence spectral function α2 F(ω) (which actually governs the strength and the spectrum of electron–phonon coupling as a function of phonon frequency) and λ(ω). In Fig. 7  , we have displayed the behavior of α2 F(ω) and λ(ω) for P6/mmm  and P6/m  phases at different pressures (corresponding to their stability regime). For P6/mmm  phase the α2 F(ω) function though displays many peaks like phonon density of states (PHDOS) for all pressures, the peak distribution and their intensities show strong dependence upon pressure. For example, the spectrum gets wider with higher frequency states getting occupied with increasing pressure and a narrow gap existing near 10 THz at 15 GPa expands with increasing pressure and extends to frequency range of ∼10 THz - 20 THz at 50 GPa. These pressure dependent variation in α2 F(ω) function is expected to affect the λ(ω) which is visible in Fig. 7  also. Further, the electron-phonon interaction parameter λ(ω) is distributed over three regions, i.e., low frequency region (LFR) i.e 0-10 THz, Intermediate frequency region (IFR) i.e 10-30 THz, and high frequency region (HFR) i.e 30-60 THz. The contribution of LFR, IFR, and HFR phonons to λ(ω) is about 60%, 35% and 5%, respectively, indicating that the largest contribution to λ(ω) comes from the acoustic phonon modes, which are mainly dominated by the coupled motion of Th, Nb and H atoms with maximum contribution coming from Th atoms. Like that for P6/mmm  phase, though, the α2 F(ω) for P6/m  phase, also, has a spectrum with many peaks distributed over frequency range ∼ 10 THz to 60 THz, the peak are relatively wider with reduced height and most of the contribution to the λ(ω) comes from low frequency and intermediate frequency regions which are mostly contributed by Th atoms. The less value of Tc for P6/m  phase as compared to that for P6/mmm  phase is to due to the lower density of states and lower electron phonon coupling constant. Another property examined for this compound is the thermal conductivity which is one of the key properties of nuclear fuel as it affects all process such as swelling, grain growth, and fission gas release and limits its linear power. For the design of new nuclear materials, it is necessary to provide a method that can predict this property efficiently under different thermodynamic conditions. In view of this, we have extended our calculation to predict the pressure induced thermal conductivity due to phonons in P6/mmm  and P6/m  phase of ThNb2 H12  up to ∼100 GPa. As dictated by symmetry, for ThNb2 H12  in P6/mmm phase, the lattice thermal conductivity tensor will have only two degrees of freedoms, Kxx  and Kzz . Fig. 8   displays the anisotropic lattice thermal conductivity as a function of temperature for P6/mmm  phase at 15 GPa. As is clear from the figure, both the components of lattice thermal conductivity exhibit significant temperature dependence for lower temperatures. At room temperature the ratio Kzz /Kxx  is found to be ∼4.84 with Kavg =(2*Kxx  + Kzz )/3–3.17 W/m/K. These parameters at 1000 K reduce to ∼3.68 and 0.49 W/m/K, indicative of the fact that the lattice thermal conductivity as well as anisotropy due to phonons decreases as temperature increases because of more electron phonon scattering. For more clarity on this aspect, the accumulated thermal conductivity at 300 K and 1000 K and its derivative with respect to the frequency has been calculated for P6/mmm  phase of ThNb2 H12  and plotted in Fig. 9  . One can easily make out from the figure that the acoustic branches contribute to ∼94% to the phonon thermal conductivity as compared to ∼6% that from optical branches. The pressure dependence of thermal conductivity is listed in Table 5   and plotted in Fig. 10  . As is obvious from the figure, thermal conductivity decreases with increasing pressure because of the reduction in group velocity of phonons with increasing pressure.  4 Summary To summarize, detailed first principles electronic band structure calculations have been carried out to explore the possibility of synthesising the ternary compound ThNb2 H12  via different reaction paths from its elemental constituents, Th, Nb and H2 , and from binary constituents’ Th-H and Nb-H under hydrostatic pressure. The comparison of the calculated enthalpy of formation of ThNb2 H12  with its elemental as well as binary constituents suggests the stabilization of ThNb2 H12  above 12.5 GPa but metastability at 0 GPa cannot be ruled out. Once the existence of the ternary compound ThNb2 H12  is established, the genetic algorithm-based structure search method implemented in the USPEX code [21–23 ] has been used to search for the stable structures of this compound at a few coarse pressures. The comparison of enthalpies derived from detailed static lattice calculations suggests that the monoclinic structure with space group symmetry Cm  has lowest enthalpy at 0 GPa. Further simulations predict that above 3.3 GPa a hexagonal structure with space group symmetry P6/mmm  appears as the lowest enthalpy phase. Upon further compression to 50 GPa, a new hexagonal phase with SG P6/m  appears as a stable phase. The predicted structural sequence under high pressure has been substantiated by testing the elastic and lattice dynamic stability of each structure in the pressure regime of its stability. Using static lattice calculations the isothermal equation of state has also been determined up to 100 GPa. Analysis of the spectral function α2 F(ω) reveals the importance of the coupled in-phase motions of Th and hydrogen atoms which makes the largest contribution to the average electron-phonon coupling parameter λ(ω). By integrating the spectral function, the average electron-phonon coupling parameter λ is found to be 0.77 corresponding to the transition temperature (Tc ) 25 K for P6/mmm  phase at 15 GPa suggesting the superconductive property, whereas the same for P6/m  phase at 100 GPa is 0.40 with corresponding Tc  ∼4 K. The reduction of transition temperature is due to the reduction of strength of electron coupling parameter. Using Boltzmann transport equation, we have determined lattice thermal conductivity due to phonons and found that the average value of conductivity as well as the anisotropy in it decreases with increasing temperature, e.g. , at room temperature these parameters are ∼4.84 W/m/K and 3.17, whereas at 1000K the values reduce to 0.49 W/m/K and 3.68, respectively.

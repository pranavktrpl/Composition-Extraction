Its bulk density, Vickers hardness, fracture toughness and flexural strength were 3.207 g/cm3, 1484 HV, 7.11 MPa m1/2 and 351 MPa, respectively.

Keywords Sialon ceramic  Non-aqueous  NMP  HEMA    1 Introduction In the 1970s, Oyama and Jack found a new type of high-temperature resistant ceramic based on the Si3 N4  ceramics. This type of ceramic was named Sialon ceramic [1 ,2 ]. Sialon ceramics are derived from Si3 N4  ceramics, so their properties are similar to Si3 N4  ceramics. Sialon ceramics have better performance than metal materials under harsh conditions, such as high temperature, mechanical strength and heavy environmental corrosion [3–6 ], and are regarded as pivotal materials to replace metal materials in certain fields. The Sialon ceramic can be formed by pressing, injection, extrusion, etc. [7 ]. However, due to the high brittleness, Sialon ceramics cannot be made into large components, and the machining cost is excessive. Therefore, the application of Sialon ceramics in production is greatly restricted. Thus, gelcasting was developed. Almost three decades ago, scientists exploited a new molding technology called gelcasting in the US [8 ,9 ]. The advantage of this technology is its ability to produce large-sized and complex ceramic components that can reduce processing costs. Gelcasting is divided into aqueous gelcasting and non-aqueous gelcasting. Aqueous gelcasting use water as solvent and non-aqueous gelcasting use organic solvent as solvent. Non-aqueous gelcasting is developed for ceramic materials that react with water. Currently, scientists are increasingly studying the combination of non-aqueous gelcasting and ceramics. Aqueous gelcasting is not suitable for preparing highly porous ceramics because of the high surface tension. To solve this problem, Yicheng Jin [10 ] used a type of non-aqueous gel with low surface tension to preparing SiC ceramics. They used glycol (EG), acrylamide (AM) and N, N-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAM) as the solvent, monomer and crosslinker, respectively. They found that the EG-based gel had water-like gelling behavior and high flexibility. Furthermore, due to the high polarity of EG, the initiator had high reactivity, which resulted in the EG-based gel having the same polymerization rate as water-based gels. AlN reacts with water to produce Al(OH)3  and NH3  (AlN+3H2 O→Al(OH)3 +NH3 ), so it cannot be used with aqueous gelcasting. Aiming at the problem of the easy hydrolysis of AlN, Lin Guo [11 ] used a non-aqueous gel system based on the N, N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAA) monomer. They used N, N-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAM) and Polyetherimide as the crosslinker and dispersant, respectively. Furthermore, the solvent of the non-aqueous gel consists of ethanol, N, N-dimethylacetamide and PEG-200. In their study, the green bodies of the non-aqueous gel showed a bending strength of 18.68 MPa. Xueshun Xu [12 ] used a gel system based on the 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA) monomer and TMPTA crosslinker to prepare AlN ceramic. He found that by adding the polymerization inhibitor phenothiazine and hydroquinone to the slurry, the induction period of the ceramic slurry was effectively extended. Additionally, the bending strength of the green body can reach 42.3 MPa. Since the traditional raw materials for the preparation of Sialon ceramics contain AlN powder, it is necessary to use non-aqueous gelcasting to prepare Sialon ceramics. However, up till the present moment, there have been very few reports on fabrication of Sialon ceramics by non-aqueous gelcasting. Therefore, we have developed a new type of non-aqueous gel system that has not been used before to prepare Sialon ceramic. The NMP, HEMA, TMPTA were used as the solvent, monomer and crosslinker in this study. In the traditional HEMA/TMPTA gel system, PEG-400 is used as a solvent, and the viscosity of the slurry is high [13 ]. In this work, we used NMP instead of PEG-400 as the solvent for the HEMA/TMPTA gel system. This innovation not only greatly reduces the viscosity of the slurry, but also simplifies the experimental process. By studying the slurry rheological properties, flexural strength of green body and other factors, the relevant parameters of Sialon ceramic prepared by HEMA/TMPTA gel system were optimized.  2 Experimental procedures 2.1 Raw materials The Sialon ceramics were prepared by Si3 N4  powders (d50 = 0.7 μm, α phase content ≥95%, UBE Industries, Ltd., Japan), AlN powders (d50 = 1 μm, Qinghe Xinhu Metal Materials Co., Ltd., China), Al2 O3  powders (α phase content ≥96%, Zhengzhou Xideli Chemical New Material Co., Ltd., China) and Y2 O3  powders (Hangzhou Jiupeng New Materials Co., Ltd., China). The solvent consists of NMP (Guangdong Yuemei Chemical Co., Ltd, China) and PEG-200 (Jiangsu Maoheng Chemical Co., Ltd, China). HEMA (Jinan Yuanxiang Chemical Co., Ltd, China), TMPTA (Acme Chemical Co., Ltd, China), PEI (Polyethyleneimine, Hubei Jusheng Technology Co., Ltd, China), BPO (Benzoyl peroxide, Aladdin Industrial Corporation, China) and DMA (N, N-Dimethylaniline, Zibo Xinrong Chemical Technology Co., Ltd., China) were used as the monomer, crosslinker, dispersant, initiator and catalyst, respectively. DCM (Dichloromethane, Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute, China) was used as the solvent for the initiator.  2.2 Experiment method and characterization First, the NMP, PEG-200, HEMA, TMPTA, and PEI were evenly mixed to prepare a premixed solution. Adding a small amount of PEG-200 forms a certain gradient in the NMP, which will delay the speed of the gelation, protecting the green body from cracking. Second, the Si3 N4  powders, AlN powders (9.3 wt%), Al2 O3  powders (6.7 wt%) and Y2 O3  powders were added to the premixed solution. Third, after ball milling of 8 h, the resultant slurries were degassed for 10 min in vacuum. Fourth, BPO was dissolved in the DCM to prepare an initiator solution, and then, the solution was added to the ceramic slurries. Then, the slurries were degassed for another 10 min. Fifth, the catalyst (0.2 ml) was injected into the slurry. The resultant ceramic slurries were stirred slowly for a few seconds and were then casted into silicone molds. Then, the molds were placed into the environmental test chamber. The chamber was adjusted to a low relative humidity and was held at 50 °C for 24 h, 60 °C for 12 h and 70 °C for 12 h. Since the ceramic slurries contained PEG-200, the humidity of the chamber cannot be too high, otherwise the green bodies may crack because of absorbing too much water. Finally, the green bodies of the ceramics were taken out and degreased in a muffle furnace. For the degreasing process, the green bodies were heated from 25 °C to 500 °C over a period of 1200 min before soaking at 500 °C for 600 min. After that, the samples were sintered in a flowing N2  atmosphere at three sintering temperatures in a sintering furnace (1600 °C, 1650 °C and 1700 °C) operated at a normal pressure and heated with a ramp of 7.5 °C, and the sintering temperature was held for 1 h. The rheological behavior was characterized using a rotary rheometer (C-LTD80/QC, Anton Paar, Australia). The phase of the ceramics was identified using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan). The microstructures of the ceramics were examined using a scanning electron microscopy (Inspect F50, FEI, USA). The bulk densities were tested by a density instrument. The flexural strengths were determined using the three-point bending method with a bending strength machine (CMT4504, Suns Corporation, China), for which the size of the bars was 5.25 mm × 6.5 mm × 21 mm. The Vickers hardness and fracture toughness values were tested by a hardness tester (270VRSTV, Affri, Italy).   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Rheological property Fig. 1   and Fig. 2   show the shear thickening behavior of the ceramic slurry. It can be seen from the figure that as the shear rate increases, the viscosity and shear stress of the suspension show an upward trend. This phenomenon is called shear thickening. Shear thickening is commonly found in materials such as bulletproof equipment (such as shear thickening fluids). When the bullet hits the bulletproof equipment, the high-speed rotation of the bullet causes the particles inside the material to collide quickly. The shear rate of the material increases instantaneously, which restrains the relative movement between the particles. Under this circumstance, the viscosity and shear stress of the fluid also increase significantly. In this case, the bullet needs to consume more energy (such as kinetic energy) to destroy the toughness of the material. Fig. 1  shows the rheological curve of the slurry with a solid loading of 41.3 vol%, 39.6 vol%, and 37.8 vol% at a ball milling time of 8 h. The rheological curve is composed of a shear thinning area, a shear thickening area and a rapid decline area after reaching the maximum viscosity [14 ]. As shown in Fig. 1 , when the solid loading value increases from 37.8 vol% to 41.3 vol%, the viscosity of the slurry increases. The critical shear rates of the slurry with the solid loading values of 41.3 vol%, 39.6 vol% and 37.8 vol% were 39.81 s−1 , 79.43 s−1  and 79.43 s−1 , respectively, and the viscosity increases by 10 times, 14 times and 7 times (compared to the maximum value). Before the critical shear rate, the ceramic particles are oriented in the direction of flow so that they can easily slip past each other. However, after passing the critical shear rate and reaching a higher shear rate, these particles will continue to interfere with each other's flow, which causes an irregular flow field, resulting in shear thickening. The growth trend of the shear stress curve of the slurries is consistent with the viscosity. The maximum shear stress values of the slurries with solid loading values of 41.3 vol%, 39.6 vol% and 37.8 vol% were 1652 Pa, 1307 Pa, and 439 Pa, respectively. In this case, the higher the solid loading, the more powder particles were contained in the unit volume, and the higher the internal friction between the particles. Therefore, the slurries with a low solid phase content show a better fluidity than those with high solid phase contents. Table 1   shows the drying shrinkage rate of the green bodies at different solid loading values. It can be seen that when the solid loading value is 41.3 vol%, the green body has the lowest shrinkage. From the perspective of near-net-shape molding, the green bodies with the solid loading of 41.3 vol% is the most ideal. Fig. 2  shows the effects of different dispersant dosages of slurries at a ball milling time of 8 h. The rheological curves of the slurries with 4 vol% and 6 vol% dispersant dosages were composed of a shear thinning area, a shear thickening area and a descent area, and their critical shear rates were 50.12 s−1  and 79.43 s−1 , respectively. The rheological curve of the slurry with a dispersant dosage of 8 vol% is composed of a stable area, a shear thickening area and a rapid descent area. The critical shear rate is 79.43 s−1 . Before the shear rate of 63.09 s−1 , the order of the viscosity of the slurry from large to small is 4 vol%> 8 vol%> 6 vol%. When the shear rate is greater than 63.09 s−1 , the order of the viscosity of the slurry from large to small is 8 vol%> 4 vol%> 6 vol%. The trend of the shear stress curve is also the same as the viscosity curve. Too much or too little dispersant will increase the viscosity of the slurry because of its sensitivity [15 ]. When the PEI content is low, unsaturated absorption occurs on the surfaces of the ceramic particles, and there are few free-moving polymers surrounding the liquid medium. Electrostatic repulsion and the space steric effect are the main dispersion mechanisms; therefore, the viscosity of the slurry decreases with the increase of the dispersant dosage [16 ]. When the PEI content exceeds a certain critical point (adsorption saturation), the excess dispersant is free in the liquid medium around the powder, increasing the polymer concentration, resulting in increased flow friction, which in turn, increases the viscosity of the entire liquid medium. In addition, as the dispersant dosage further increases, the dispersant may entangle its own carbon chains or molecules, thereby forming micelles. This micelle will absorb a large amount of solvent under the effect of electrostatic attraction, which will reduce the volume of the free solvent in the slurry, making the viscosity increase with the increase of its dosage. Therefore, in the non-aqueous HEMA/TMPTA gel system, the slurry with the 6 vol% dispersant dosage had the lowest viscosity and the best dispersion stability.  3.2 Flexural strength of the green bodies The non-aqueous gel system has two characteristics, as follows: 1. during the gelation, the organic solvent always maintains a state of low vapor pressure and 2. the viscosity is low. The steps of the crosslinking polymerization reaction in the non-aqueous gelcasting are as follows:(1) Chain initiation: W 2   → 2W    Y  + W  → WY     Among them, W2  is an initiator, and Y is an organic monomer (with a double bond).(2) Chain propagation: WY  + Y  → WYY  + Y  → WY 2  Y  + nY  → WY n+2  Y   (3) Chain termination: WY n+2  Y  + WY m+2  Y  → WY m+n+5  Y     In the HEMA/TMPTA gel system, the crosslinker TMPTA contains multiple double bonds and initiates the crosslinking reaction by graft polymerization during gelation. The BPO initiator induces a crosslinking reaction of multiple organic monomers and constructs a three-dimensional network structure, which ‘locks’ the powder to form a non-aqueous gel, and the particles are coated by gel, forming ceramic green bodies. The HEMA to TMPTA ratio will affect the flexural strength values of the green bodies. Under the influence of temperature, HEMA undergoes a polymerization to form Poly-hydroxyethyl methacrylate [17 ], forming a green body structure with certain mechanical properties. As the shown in Fig. 3  , when the ratio of HEMA to TMPTA increased, the flexural strength of the green body first increased and then decreased. As the concentration of the crosslinker increased, the reaction of HEMA and TMPTA increased, and the free organic matter content decreased, so that the flexural strength of the green body increased. When HEMA: TMPTA = 10:1, the green body has the maximum flexural strength of 13.07 MPa. At this ratio, the ceramic green body has the most stable and dense structure [18 ]. As the TMPTA content further increased, the excess organic matter in the green bodies increased, and the free molecular chains increased, causing the strength of the material to decrease. It can be concluded from this case that when the ratio of HEMA to TMPTA is 10:1, the ceramic green body has the best mechanical strength. Table 2   shows the flexural strength of Sialon green bodies with different HEMA contents, and the ratio of HEMA and TMPTA is 10:1. As the HEMA content increased, the flexural strength of the green bodies increased. Considering both the mechanical property and the production cost, a HEMA concentration of 20 wt% should be adopted [19 ].  3.3 Phases and microstructures analysis β′-Sialon is obtained by dissolving the Al and O atoms in Al2 O3  into Si3 N4 ; the length of the Al–O bond is similar to that of the Si–N bond, so β′-Sialon has the most stable structure. The stability of the β′-Sialon structure is related to the Z value. A high Z value will increase the cell dimensions and the bond energy will become weaker, resulting in a loose crystal structure and poor stability [20 ]. Additionally, the density and mechanical properties of the ceramics also decrease. Therefore, it is extremely important to reasonably control the Z value of β′-Sialon. It can be seen from Fig. 4   that the phase composition of Sialon ceramics mainly includes SiO2 , β′-Sialon and Si3 N4 . Since the Sialon ceramics were obtained under an N2  condition, SiO2  may exist in impurities or be obtained by Si3 N4  reacting with the O2  in the powder and organic solvent [21 ]. At a reaction temperature of 1600 °C, some Si3 N4  in the Sialon ceramics has not been replaced. As the temperature rises, the number and peak strength of the Si3 N4  phase gradually decrease, while those of the β′-Sialon phases increase. At the same time, the energy brought by the temperature increase helps the Al and O atoms to reach a sufficient driving force to enter the Si3 N4  and form the Sialon phase, which is why the Si3 N4  phase in the sintered ceramic was not observed at the reaction temperatures of 1650 °C and 1700 °C. When the reaction temperature is below 1700 °C, the main products of the β′-Sialon phase in Sialon ceramics are Si4 Al2 O2 N6 , Si4.69 Al1.31 O1.31 N6.69  and Si5 AlON7 . Their corresponding Z values are 2, 1.31 and 1. The inconsistency of the β′-Sialon phase composition is attributed to the excessively rapid heating rate [22 ]. Since the diffraction peaks corresponding to Si4 Al2 O2 N6 , Si4.69 Al1.31 O1.31 N6.69  and Si5 AlON7  do not differ much, they can all be regarded as β′-Sialon. When the reaction temperature is 1700 °C, the component of the β′-Sialon phase is only Si5 AlON7 , and the corresponding Z value is 1. Combined with the previous theory, the following conclusion can be explored: the large amount of energy brought by the temperature increase will promote the generation of the Sialon phase. Additionally, as the temperature further increases, the Z value of the β′-Sialon decreases, indicating that the unit cell structure becomes much denser, causing the stability and strength of the Sialon material to improve. Before the SEM microstructure characterization, the surface of the Sialon ceramic was etched in molten NaOH for 135 s after polishing. Fig. 5   shows the microstructure of the β′-Sialon ceramics at a magnification of 5000x. It can be seen from the figure that when the sintering temperature is 1600 °C, there are many irregular long grains. The sizes of the β′-Sialon grains at 1600 °C are smaller than the ceramic grains at the other two sintering temperatures under the same magnification. Combined with the observation of the XRD diffraction pattern, the β′-Sialon grains inside the ceramic are still in the stage of growth and development. Some of the Si3 N4  has not been replaced by aluminum and oxygen atoms. Under this sintering condition, there is not enough energy to promote the growth of β′-Sialon grains; thus, it is incompletely developed. At this time, β′-Sialon exists in the form of fine and nearly rod-shaped grains. When the sintering temperature is 1650 °C, the β′-Sialon grains are long columnar grains with a large aspect ratio. It can be seen from Fig. 4  that the Si3 N4  is completely replaced to generate β′-Sialon at this temperature. With the further increase of temperature, the disordered arrangement of the β′-Sialon grains may lead to the generation of self-locking structures [23 ]. The stacked structure arrangement will increase the strength and toughness of the Sialon ceramics. Additionally, it is worth noting that some small particles attached to the columnar crystal body were observed at 1700 °C, which are the traces left after the liquid phase flows.  3.4 Mechanical properties of the sintered sialon ceramic Table 3   shows the mechanical properties of the sintered bodies. It can be seen from the table that the bulk density, Vickers hardness and flexural strength of the β′-Sialon ceramics increase with the reaction temperature. However, the fracture toughness does not change much, and the relevant values are close. In the sintering process, the powder of the Sialon ceramics obtains a large amount of energy, which satisfies the thermodynamic and kinetic conditions of growth and development of the β′-Sialon grain. With the increase of the sintering temperature, processes such as particle rearrangement, dissolution-precipitation mass transfer, solid particle interaction, and reduced pores occur inside the ceramic. The glass phase formed by the reaction of the sintering aid Y2 O3  promotes the rearrangement of the particles, enhancing the bonding force between the crystal grains, which makes the ceramic structure denser [24 ]. Therefore, the bulk density, Vickers hardness and flexural strength of the β′-Sialon ceramics increase with the reaction temperature. Normally, the fracture toughness of β′-Sialon ceramics obtained by atmospheric pressure sintering is 3–5 MPa m1/2  [25 ]. However, the fracture toughness value of the β′-Sialon ceramics in this work can reach at least 7 MPa m1/2 . There are many factors that affect the fracture toughness. First, due to the good uniformity of gelcasting advantage, the pore distribution in the sample is also uniform. Since the cracks propagate inside the material under the effect of uniformly arranged pores, the crack propagation path becomes longer, resulting in increased energy consumption during crack propagation. In terms of the overall effect, the apparent fracture surface energy of the Sialon ceramics increases. Second, β′-Sialon grains are arranged in a disordered order. This type of structure increases the difficulty of transcrystalline fractures. Third, there is SiO2  in Sialon ceramics. The density of SiO2  and Si3 N4  are 2.3 g/cm3  and 3.44 g/cm3 , respectively. After the chemical reaction, SiO2  is generated and the volume expands, which will fill the micro cracks and heal them. In the process of microcrack healing, the adsorption and diffusion mechanisms play major roles. With the increase of the sintering temperature, the microcrack region is continuously healed by the adsorption of O2  and the diffusion of the SiO2  product [26 ]. According to the value of various properties, the β′-Sialon ceramic at the sintering temperature of 1700 °C has the best comprehensive mechanical properties. Its bulk density, Vickers hardness, fracture toughness and flexural strength were 3.207 g/cm3 , 1484 HV, 7.11 MPa m1/2  and 351 MPa, respectively.   4 Conclusion In this work, the combination of non-aqueous HEMA/TMPTA gel system and Sialon ceramics was successfully studied. All the slurries of this non-aqueous system showed shear-thickening. The optimized dispersant dosage for the preparation of slurries with good rheological properties was determined to be 6 vol%. As the HEMA content increases, the flexural strength values of the green bodies increase. When the ratio of HEMA to TMPTA is 10:1, the maximum flexural strength of the green body is 13.07 MPa. The β′-Sialon ceramic at the sintering temperature of 1700 °C has the best comprehensive mechanical properties. Its bulk density, Vickers hardness, fracture toughness and flexural strength were 3.207 g/cm3 , 1484 HV, 7.11 MPa m1/2  and 351 MPa, respectively. According to the current research, the non-aqueous HEMA/TMPTA gel system can be used for the fabrication of Sialon ceramics.

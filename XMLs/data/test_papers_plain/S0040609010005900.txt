                  The equilibrium atomic structures of the Au3Pt3 cluster and NH3, H2S molecules are determined by Density Functional Theory calculations. The adsorption of NH3 and H2S molecules on Au3Pt3 cluster is then studied. The energy levels and the corresponding charge densities, adsorption energies, charge transfer and magnetization are calculated for different adsorption sites. We find that the adsorption generally modifies the structure of the Au3Pt3 cluster and the adsorbate. There exists strong interaction between Pt and N atoms. We observe that H2S dissociate at a specific site for the local density approximation (LDA) and one of the H atoms binds to Pt. In general, there is charge transfer from the molecules NH3 and H2S to Au3Pt3 cluster, for almost all adsorption sites. This makes the Au3Pt3 cluster semiconducting.

The equilibrium atomic structures of the Au3 Pt3  cluster and NH3 , H2 S molecules are determined by Density Functional Theory calculations. The adsorption of NH3  and H2 S molecules on Au3 Pt3  cluster is then studied. The energy levels and the corresponding charge densities, adsorption energies, charge transfer and magnetization are calculated for different adsorption sites. We find that the adsorption generally modifies the structure of the Au3 Pt3  cluster and the adsorbate. There exists strong interaction between Pt and N atoms. We observe that H2 S dissociate at a specific site for the local density approximation (LDA) and one of the H atoms binds to Pt. In general, there is charge transfer from the molecules NH3  and H2 S to Au3 Pt3  cluster, for almost all adsorption sites. This makes the Au3 Pt3  cluster semiconducting.   Keywords Density Functional Theory  Au3 Pt3   Clusters  Adsorption  Ammonia  Hydrogen sulfide    1 Introduction The increased attention metal clusters have received is mainly due to their high surface area to volume ratio [1,2] . Pure gold clusters have been investigated extensively because of their importance in applications as catalysts and functionalized nanomaterials [3–25] . Pure platinum clusters have been the center of interest mainly because of their potential role as catalysts in automotive industry, fuel cells and their possible role in magnetic data storage [26–28] . Gold–platinum bimetallic nanoparticles on the other hand, are investigated for their role in CO adsorption and oxidation [29–38] , NO adsorption and reduction [39] , CH3 OH oxidation [40,41] . It is established that bimetallic systems are better catalysts than pure metal clusters [4,40,42–55] . This increase in catalytic activity is determined by controllable factors such as composition, temperature and the method of preparation. Cruz et al. [49]  investigated H2  adsorption on AuPtn   clusters using ab initio multiconfiguration self-consistent field calculations. They show that gold has an electronic effect which poisons Pt activity to dissociate H2 . Joshi et al. [32]  studied CO adsorption on binary Au-alloys (Aun  Mm   clusters: n  = 0–3, m  = 0–3, and m  + n  = 2 (dimers) or 3 (trimers), M = Cu/Ag/Pd/Pt.) They observed that CO binds on Aun  Mm   except Pd2 , Pt2  and Pt3 . Effect of adsorption site, size and composition of bimetallic Pt/Au bimetallic clusters on the C–O stretching frequency is studied by Sadek and Wang using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations [33] . They find that adsorption site is the most sensitive quantity to the C–O stretching frequency shifts. Tada et al. [50]  investigated experimentally the preparation of Au/Pt core/shell bimetallic clusters on TiO2  surfaces. They also did calculations on the model clusters by using DFT to understand the surface bonding between the sulfur and metal clusters. They observe that the adsorption of sulfur-containing compounds on the substrate can be controlled and the adsorption energy changes with Pt/Au atomic ratio. Wang [34]  showed by a DFT calculation that CO adsorbs upside-down on small Ptm  Aun   (m , n  = 0–4) clusters, Pt(111), Au(111), and Pt0.25 Au0.75 (111) surfaces. Neria et al. [56]  studied H2  adsorption on AuPt3  by using Hartree–Fock self-consistent field calculations. They find that AuPt3  cluster can capture and dissociate the H2  molecule. Despite of all these investigations, the work on Au3 Pt3  cluster is really scarce. We therefore consider the adsorption of NH3  and H2 S on Au3 Pt3  clusters. Catalytic activity increases as the cluster size is getting smaller. This is why we consider the Au3 Pt3  cluster. There are different reasons for studying NH3 . The nitridation of silicon surface is of technological importance. The resulting silicon nitride acts as a dielectric layer in metal-insulator–semiconductor devices [57–59] . Ammonia dehydrogenation and oxidation have been extensively studied [60–65] . The adsorption of ammonia on nanostructures is important for controlling the catalytic processes in gas generators. This is also important for oxygen production for electric fuel cells [66,67] . H2 S, on the other hand, is toxic and corrosive. It presents serious problems to the environment and industry. It is therefore of both scientific and technological importance to develop nanoscale sensors in addition to the more traditional macroscopic scale H2 S sensors [68] . In this work, we have studied Au3 Pt3  cluster using the DFT approach. We investigate the energy levels, charge densities, adsorption energies, charge transfer and magnetization theoretically for NH3  and H2 S adsorption on Au3 Pt3 . We employ DFT within local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) at the Γ-point. We find that the adsorption modifies the structure of Au3 Pt3  cluster and the adsorbate. There is charge transfer from molecules NH3  and H2 S to Au3 Pt3  for almost all sites. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , we summarize the computational details. The results are given in Section 3 . We conclude in Section 4 .  2 Computational details Plane wave self-consistent field package [69]  based on DFT is used in our calculations. We carried out all calculations at the Γ-point. We have used two different approximations: GGA and LDA for establishing the equilibrium structure of Aun  Ptn   cluster up to n  = 3 atoms in vacuum [70] . We find similar equilibrium structures for Au3 Pt3  within GGA and LDA. We have also established the equilibrium structure for NH3  and H2 S by using the same method. We have used the ultrasoft pseudopotentials within GGA and LDA. For Pt, N and H, we have used the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and Rabe Rappe Kaxiras Joannopoulos (ultrasoft) exchange correlation (xc) within GGA. For Au and S, PBE xc, Vanderbilt ultrasoft within GGA are used. Within LDA, for Pt, N and H; Perdew–Zunger (LDA) xc, Rabe Rappe Kaxiras Joannopoulos (ultrasoft) are used. For Au and S; Perdew–Zunger (LDA) xc, Vanderbilt ultrasoft are used [71–74] . A cutoff energy of 408 eV is used with the plane wave basis. Hellmann–Feynman forces and conventional minimization techniques are used to determine the equilibrium structure. We calculate the adsorption energy, as follows;(1) E a  = − E total  − E Au 3  Pt 3    − E adsorbate        where E Au3  Pt3   and E adsorbate  denote the energy of the isolated Au3 Pt3  and the adsorbate, respectively. We have investigated the charge transfer by using the Löwdin analysis [75] . The energy levels and charge densities are calculated for energies around the Fermi level.  3 Results We tried six possible configurations for adsorption of NH3  and H2 S on Au3 Pt3  cluster, as shown in Fig. 1  . We see that the relaxed structures for starting B2 and H2 configurations are the same for NH3  adsorption. The initial and stable configurations are given in Fig. 1  for NH3  adsorption. As seen in Fig. 1 (b)–(d) and (f),(g),(j) and (k), the strong interaction between Pt and N atoms results in the modification of Au3 Pt3  cluster for H1,H2,T1 and B1-sites within GGA and H1, B2 and B1 within LDA. Fig. 1 (e) shows that the shape of the cluster is not modified after the interaction only for the T2-site where the interaction between Au and N is weaker for GGA. It is important to note that the cluster transforms from a planar to a three-dimensional structure in cases of adsorption on H1, H2, T1 and B1-sites within GGA for NH3  and H1- and H2-sites for H2 S within GGA and H1-, B2-, and B1-sites for NH3  and T1- and B2-sites for H2 S within LDA. 3.1 NH3  adsorption on Au3 Pt3  The calculated adsorption energies and bond lengths of NH3  on Au3 Pt3  are given in Table 1  . We observe that the most stable structure is H2 with the largest adsorption energy. The smallest bond length between Pt and N is for the H2-site which is close to the experimental value of (2.062(7)(Å)) [76] . There is a stronger interaction between Pt and N atoms than between Au and Pt so that they have smaller bond lengths. N atom prefers to bind to the Pt atom. The bond length between Au and N is longest for the T2-site. It is close to the bond lengths (2.35 Å and 2.39 Å) given in the literature [77,78] . The total charge transfers are given in Table 1  for NH3  adsorption on Au3 Pt3  within GGA. While the charge on Au3  increases, the charge on Pt3  and NH3  decreases as seen in Table 1  for H1, H2-sites. There is charge transfer from NH3  to Au3 Pt3  cluster. The total charge on Au3  and Pt3  increases but the charge on the Pt atom which binds N decreases. The charge on NH3  decreases for T1- and B1-sites. For the T2-site, the charge transfer is similar to the case of T1-site but in addition, there is a charge transfer between Au and Pt atoms. The total magnetization of NH3  on Au3 Pt3  is given in Table 1 . Magnetization values are closer to each other for all sites within GGA. The total magnetization of bare Au3 Pt3  cluster is 3.00 μ B /cell. The binding energy is 2.63 eV. We compared the results of the bare Au3 Pt3  cluster with the available data. The bond lengths between Au–Pt and Pt–Pt are 2.62 Å and 2.64 Å, respectively. These values are closer to the data in the literature (2.60 Åand 2.55 Å) [4] . We have also calculated the energy levels and charge densities near the Fermi level at the Γ-point for spin up and spin down states within GGA. Energy levels and charge densities, for five configurations and for the bare Au3 Pt3  cluster are given in Fig. 2  . There exists charge on the Pt and Au atoms Fig. 2 (a) for bare Au3 Pt3  cluster. Fig. 2 (b) and (c) shows that charge distributions for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) are on the Pt and Au atoms and the bond between Pt and N. This result is in agrement with the charge transfer analysis. Fig. 2 (d) shows that the charge distributions for the HOMO, there is the charge on Pt and Au atoms. This charge distribution is also reflected on the charge distribution of the HOMO. For T2, charge distributions are on the Pt and Au atoms as seen in Fig. 2 (e). For B1-site, generally, the charge distributions on the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are on the Pt and Au atoms as seen in Fig. 2 (f). LUMO is closer to Fermi level for B1-site as in Fig. 2 (f). We have done the same calculations within LDA. Adsorption energy (E a ), bond lengths (d ), M, Δρ  are given in Table 2  . The most stable configuration is for the T1-site as seen in Table 2 . N prefers to bind to the Pt atom. There exists charge transfer from the adsorbate to Au3 Pt3 . These results are in agrement with the GGA results. The highest magnetization value is for the adsorption to the H1-site. The stable configurations are given in Fig. 1 (g)–(k). The energy levels and charge densities near the Fermi level for spin up and spin down states are given in Fig. 3 (a)–(e) . Generally, the charges are on the Au3 Pt3  cluster. There exists also charge near the Fermi level between the Pt and N atoms for the H1- and B1-sites. The results show that the calculated values strongly depend on the type of exchange-correlation functional used.  3.2 H2 S adsorption on Au3 Pt3  We performed the same calculations for Au3 Pt3 –H2 S. The stable and initial configurations are given in Fig. 4 (a)–(j) . We obtain similar configurations as in Au3 Pt3 –NH3 . There is a strong interaction between S and Pt atoms. The shape of the cluster is modified after the adsorption, as seen in Fig. 4 (a) and (b). Adsorption energies and bond lengths calculated within GGA are given in Table 3  . We see that the relaxed structures for starting B2 and H2 are the same. The most stable configuration is H1. The bond lengths between Au–S and Pt–S are in agrement with the available data (2.26 Å for Au–S and 2.242 Å for Pt–S) [79,80] . The total charge transfers are given in Table 3  within GGA. The charge on the Pt atom which bonds to S atom increases for H1- and H2-sites. The charge on H2 S decreases for H2-, T2- and H1-sites but overall, the charge on the Au3 Pt3  cluster increases. For T1- and B1-sites, the charge on the Au3  atoms decreases, Pt3  atoms increase. There is also charge transfer to Au and Pt atoms. The charge on the H2  atoms increases for T1- and B1-sites. The charge on the Au3  atoms increases, Pt3  atoms decrease within T2. There is a net charge transfer from H2 S to the Au3 Pt3  cluster for all sites. The total magnetization of Au3 Pt3 –H2 S is given in Table 3  within GGA. Generally, the magnetization values are close to each other. The smallest magnetization value is for the adsorption on T1-site. We have calculated the energy levels and charge densities corresponding to states around the Fermi level for spin up and spin down states. Energy level diagrams and charge densities for five configurations are given in Fig. 5  . Fig. 5 (a) shows that, generally the charge distribution is on the Au and Pt atoms for H1-site. But there exists the charge distribution on the S atoms for the LUMO. For H2-site, it has similar charge distribution to H1-site as seen in Fig. 5 (b). The charge density is on the Au, Pt and the bond between Pt and S atoms for T1-site (Fig. 5 (c)). But for, there is no charge density on Pt which binds to N for the LUMO. For T2-site, Fig. 5 (d) shows that there exists charge on the Au and Pt atoms. For the HOMO, while there exists charge on the Pt atom which bonds to S atoms, for the LUMO, there is no charge on the bond between Pt and S atoms within B1-site (Fig. 5 (e)). The LUMO is closer to Fermi level for H1-, H2-, T1- and B1-sites as seen in Fig. 5 (a),(b),(c), and (e). These results are in agrement with the charge transfer results. E a , d , M, Δρ  values calculated within LDA are given in Table 4  . Although we tried to perform single-point LDA calculations using GGA geometry, the calculation for H1-site has not converged. There are no relaxed structures for this site. The adsorption of to the B2-site shows a totally different structure from others. H2 S dissociates at this site. The dissociated H binds to Pt. The remaining S binds to both Au and Pt with its H attached as seen in Fig. 4 (i). The bond length of Pt–H is closer to the literature (1.89 Å) [81] . The adsorption energies calculated are bigger than those calculated within GGA. The most stable configuration is B2-site, as seen in Table 4 . The highest magnetization value is for the adsorption to T2-site. There is total charge transfer from the adsorbate to cluster but there occurs a charge transfer to both H from the binding Pt and S atoms. The stable configurations are given in Fig. 4 (f)–(j). The energy levels and charge densities near the Fermi level for spin up and spin down states are given in Fig. 6 (a)–(e) .Generally, there are charges on the Au3 Pt3  cluster. There is charge on the bond between Au–S atoms for the B2-site and on the bond between Pt and S for the T1-site, as seen in Fig. 6 (d) and (b). There is also charge on the N atom for B2- and B1-sites as seen in Fig. 6 (d) and (e). We observe that Au3 Pt3 –NH3  and Au3 Pt3 –H2 S have Fermi levels between the HOMO and the LUMO for all sites. There is a charge transfer from the adsorbate to Au3 Pt3  cluster in accordance with the Löwdin analysis. It makes Au3 Pt3  cluster semiconducting.   4 Conclusion We investigated the site dependent electronic properties of Au3 Pt3 –NH3  and Au3 Pt3 –H2 S. We have studied six adsorption sites. The results indicated generally that the electronic and geometrical factors are playing key roles for adsorption sites. Adsorption energies within GGA (LDA) are bigger for the sites H1 and H2 (T1 and T2) with higher coordination numbers for NH3 . The most stable structure for NH3  adsorption within GGA is the H2-site, which has an adsorption energy of 1.64 eV. For LDA; T1-site is the most stable structure, which has an adsorption energy of 2.26 eV. The bond lengths between the adsorbates and the Pt atom are the shortest for the most stable structures, 2.11 Å for GGA and 2.04 Å for LDA. For H2 S, adsorption energies within GGA which (LDA) are bigger for the sites H1 and H2 (B2) with higher coordination numbers. The most stable structure for GGA is the H2-site which has an adsorption energy of 1.61 eV, for LDA; B2-site is the most stable structure, which has an adsorption energy of 3.01 eV. The adsorption of H2 S to the B2-site shows a totally different structure from others. H2 S dissociates at this site within LDA. There is a strong interaction between Pt and N atoms and also between Pt and S atoms. Some of configurations are modified after the interaction. The clusters transform from a planar to three-dimensional structures for these sites. We see that bond lengths between Au and N, Pt and N, Au and S, Pt and S, Pt and H are in agreement with the available literature [49,77–81] . There is a charge transfer from the adsorbate to the Au3 Pt3  cluster according to the Löwdin analysis. We see that total charge transfer and total magnetization values are closer to each other for all sites within GGA. LDA results give smaller total magnetization and bigger charge transfer than GGA. We have also calculated the energy levels for all configurations. We observe that the energy levels around the Fermi level correspond to charge distributions which are in agrement with the results of the Löwdin analysis. Comparing d  and E a  for both adsorbates, we see that Pt–N interaction is generally stronger than Pt–S interaction, as a result of this, E a  in NH3  adsorption (d ) is bigger (smaller) than in H2 S adsorption, with the exception of B2-site within LDA. DFT is known to be efficient in finding different geometries. But finding different energies and bond lengths in LDA and GGA is a signal that energy results may be questionable. The real values may be in between the LDA and GGA results [70] . Although DFT is known to be problematic for charge transfer studies, it gives correctly the direction of charge transfer [82–84] . This problem can be handled if one goes beyond the simple first order approach [85] .

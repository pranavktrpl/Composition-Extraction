                  CaO-B2O3-SiO2 glass/Al2O3 composites were developed for low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) applications and the sintering behaviors, phase compositions, microstructures and properties were investigated. The low melting point glass not only efficiently promoted the sintering densification of the composites, but also significantly improved the dielectric, mechanical and thermal performances. The glass/ceramic composite with 50wt% glass sintered at 875°C for 15min exhibited bulk density of 3.12g/cm3, εr of 8.06 and tanδ of 1.2×10−3 at 7GHz, flexural strength of 204MPa, thermal expansion coefficient of 5.47ppm/°C, and thermal conductivity of 3.1W/mK. It was compatible with Ag electrodes, which made it a promising candidate for LTCC application.

CaO-B2 O3 -SiO2  glass/Al2 O3  composites were developed for low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) applications and the sintering behaviors, phase compositions, microstructures and properties were investigated. The low melting point glass not only efficiently promoted the sintering densification of the composites, but also significantly improved the dielectric, mechanical and thermal performances. The glass/ceramic composite with 50 wt% glass sintered at 875 °C for 15 min exhibited bulk density of 3.12 g/cm3 , εr  of 8.06 and tanδ of 1.2×10−3  at 7 GHz, flexural strength of 204 MPa, thermal expansion coefficient of 5.47 ppm/°C, and thermal conductivity of 3.1 W/mK. It was compatible with Ag electrodes, which made it a promising candidate for LTCC application.   Keywords LTCC  Glass/ceramics  Microstructure  Dielectric properties    1 Introduction Low temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC) with excellent microwave dielectric, mechanical and thermal performances, is nowadays being increasingly employed to produce multilayer microelectronic devices made from ceramic substrates [1–3] . The obsession of the scientific and industrial field with the LTCC technology in the recent years is due primarily to the high rates of productivity in the wireless communication industries that more and more are inclined to miniaturization and integration [4,5] . However, the sintering temperature of the LTCCs should be lower than the melting point of the highly conductive electrode such as Ag, Cu or Cu/Pt, and these metal electrodes should be chemically compatible with the LTCC composites [6] . It is widely accepted that addition of low melting glasses is an economical and efficient way to lower the sintering temperature without considerably affecting the dielectric properties. Glass/ceramic composites are regarded as a potential material in LTCC substrates owning to the potential prospect as a result of exceptional physical, thermal and electrical performance [7] . The characteristics and properties of glass/ceramic composites depend primarily on the intrinsic properties and morphology of the ceramic fillers, the amorphous phase, the formed crystals and residual porosity. The glass serves as a low-temperature sintering aid benefit for densification while the ceramic fillers help in improving the physical properties [8] . K. Manu [9]  developed a new kind of strontium copper silicate (SrCuSi4 O10 : SCS)/lithium magnesium borosilicate (LMZBS) glass composite for LTCC applications. The SCS ceramic with 5 wt% LMZBS glass sintered at 900 °C had εr =5.0 and tanδ=1.9×10−3  at 5 GHz. Wang [10]  disclosed the preparation and characterization of LTCC composites based on BaO–B2 O3 –SiO2  glass/BaTiO3 , where the sintering temperature was about 900 °C and the dielectric constant was effectively adjustable from 5 to 30 by changing the BaTiO3  fraction from 60 wt% to 90 wt%. S. Arcaro [11]  synthesized Li2 O-ZrO2 -SiO2  glass/α-Al2 O3  composites which sintered between 800 °C and 900 °C and showed excellent mechanical, thermal and electrical properties. Among different LTCC glass/ceramic systems, CaO-B2 O3 -SiO2  glass/Al2 O3  has been reported as a promising material for using in microelectronic packaging owning to low firing temperature and low dielectric loss [12] . In this paper, we paid attention to the synthesis, microstructure, phase compositions and sintering mechanism of CaO-B2 O3 -SiO2  (CBS) glass/Al2 O3  composites for LTCC application, and also made the efforts on studying the effect of CBS glass contents as well as sintering temperatures on the sintering properties, dielectric performance, flexural strength, thermal expansion and thermal conductivity of the LTCC composites. Moreover, the co-fired compatibility of CBS glass/Al2 O3  composites with Ag electrodes was also investigated.  2 Experimental procedure Low softening point CaO-B2 O3 -SiO2  glass with the composition of 63 wt% SiO2 , 14 wt% B2 O3 , 12 wt% CaO, 5 wt% Al2 O3 , 1.8 wt% MgO, 2.6 wt% Na2 O, and 1.6 wt% K2 O was designed and synthesized by melting homogeneous mixture containing appropriate amounts of reagent-grade of SiO2 , H3 BO3 , CaCO3 , Al2 O3 , MgCO3 , Na2 CO3 , and K2 CO3  in a platinum crucible at 1500 °C for about 1 h in an electrically heated furnace. The resultant glass melt was quenched into deionized water as a preliminary step and then subjected to particle size reduction to 3–5 µm by ball milling, finally mixed and blended with 40 wt%−60 wt% Al2 O3  powders. The tape casting process was accomplished on a laboratory caster (BHLY-011A) with a single blade casting head. The green tapes were dried in air, cut into circular sheets of diameter 18 mm, stacked to 60 layers and laminated for 1 min at the pressure of 100 MPa, followed by the sintering process in air at 825 °C, 850 °C, 875 °C and 900 °C for 15 min, respectively. The bulk densities of the sintered samples were evaluated by the Archimedes method using water as media with the accuracy of ±0.001 g/cm3 . The phase identification of sintered specimens was performed by powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu/Kα radiation (XRD, ARL X/TRA) and short scanning made from 10° to 80° (2θ) at a scan rate of 5°/min. The microstructures were examined by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-5900). The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC, ppm/°C) was measured using a dilatometer (Netzsch DIL 402C) with a heating rate of 5 °C/min in the temperature range of 25–300 °C.(1) TEC  =  ∆  L   ∆  T ·   L       where L  (mm), was the original length of the sample, ∆L  (mm) was the length changes and ∆T  (°C) represented the changes in temperature. The flexural strength was assessed by an electronic universal material testing machine (CSS-2205). The dielectric performance in the microwave frequency range was examined by the Hakki–Coleman dielectric resonator method with a network analyzer (Agilent HP 8722ET) at the frequency of 7 GHz at room temperature. The thermal diffusivity (α) was measured using a laser-flash apparatus (Netzsch LFA427) and specific heat (Cp ) was determined by a differential scanning calorimeter (Perkin–Elmer DSC-2C). The thermal conductivity (λ, W/mK) was then obtained by multiplying the thermal diffusivity (α , m2 /s) with the density (ρ , kg/m3 ) and specific heat (Cp , J/kg K).(2) λ = α · ρ  ·C  P        3 Results and discussion The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples containing 50 wt% CBS glass sintered at different temperatures are shown in  Fig. 1 (a). The pre-existing Al2 O3  (JCPDS#82-1468) was the main crystalline phase demonstrated in the composites at all sintering temperatures, whereas the additional crystalline phases, anorthite (JCPDS#41-1486), made its first appearance at the temperatures above 850 °C and the intensity was gradually enhanced with the increasing temperature to 900 °C. The formation of anorthite phase at higher temperatures was the result of enhanced reaction between the glass and Al2 O3  filler. Fig. 1  (b) illustrated the XRD patterns of composites containing 40–60 wt% CBS glass sintered at 875 °C. Similarly, it was revealed that the XRD patterns were mainly composed of α-Al2 O3  and anorthite phase. The relative intensity of the anorthite diffraction peaks strengthened slightly as the glass content increased from 40 to 60 wt%. This result indicated that increasing the content of glass was also able to enhance the reaction between the glass and Al2 O3  fillers. In general, according to the reactivity between glass and ceramics, the densification of glass/ceramic composites can be divided into nonreactive, partially reactive, and completely reactive liquid phase sintering [13] . In this study, the densification of CBS glass/Al2 O3  composites was deemed to be partially reactive liquid sintering. During sintering densification process, amorphous glass phase appeared in glass/Al2 O3  composites, buried the Al2 O3  particles and promoted sintering densification of the composites. Generally, a higher sintering temperature as well as a higher glass content in the composites would accelerate the reaction of CBS glass and Al2 O3  fillers, leading to the formation of anorthite phase.  Fig. 2  displayed the bulk densities of CBS glass/Al2 O3  composites with 40–60 wt% glass concentrations sintered at different temperatures. The bulk densities of the sintered samples fluctuated with the sintering temperatures. More specifically, a moderate increase at first and then a slight decrease in the bulk densities for most of the compositions with increasing the sintering temperature was observed. A saturated value of 3.12 g/cm3  was achieved for the samples with 50 wt% glass contents sintered at 875 °C. This result demonstrated that the sintering densification of glass/Al2 O3  composites strongly depended on the sintering temperature. It was believed that the viscosity of low-melting glass would decrease with the temperature increased, which could facilitate particle rearrangement, remove the air and promote further densification by wetting of ceramic fillers. However, the glass melt exhibited excessive fluidity at an extremely high temperature and the air tended to be wrapped inside the composites forming closed pores before they were eliminated, which explained why the bulk densities declined with the continuous increase of sintering temperature to 900 °C [14] . This phenomenon also inevitably existed in the composites with an excessive amount of glass. That is why the bulk density of samples with 55 wt% and 60 wt% glass contents dropped off continuously in the whole temperature range. The results of the variations of bulk densities were closely connected with the microstructures of glass/ceramic composites.  Fig. 3 (a) to (c) demonstrated the SEM images of 50 wt% glass-added samples sintered at 825, 875 and 900 °C. The glass/Al2 O3  sample sintered at 825 °C exhibited a porous microstructure, while the composites of 875 °C showed up typical characteristics of LTCC, where Al2 O3  particles were covered by a large amount of liquid phase and formed a dense structure. However, the phenomenon of overheating occurred accompanied with the increase in pores and consequently the decrease in the relative density of the sintered samples when the sintering temperature increased to 900 °C. Fig. 3 (d) and (e) demonstrated the SEM images of 40 and 60 wt% glass-added samples sintered at 875 °C. For 40 wt% glass-added sample, the flowing liquid phase was not enough to completely wet the Al2 O3  particles, which gave birth to a loose and porous microstructure. On the contrary, a large amount of liquid phase accompanied with several pores appeared in the sample with 60 wt% glass sintered at the same temperature. It was understandable that in this system, CBS/Al2 O3  composites with 50 wt% glass content sintered at 875 °C (Fig. 3 (b)) was able to develop a typical and dense LTCC structure. Otherwise, the structure of LTCC composites was not sufficiently densified. The dielectric constant of the CBS glass/Al2 O3  composites prepared with 40–60 wt% glass sintered at different temperatures were shown in  Fig. 4 . It was illustrated that the dielectric constant of composites with 40–50 wt% glass increased incipiently, achieved the maximum value at 875 °C and reduced subsequently with the increasing of temperature, while the samples of 55 wt% and 60 wt% showed a gradual decrease. It was also worth pointing out that the influence of glass content on the dielectric constant of the composites could not be ignored. The permittivity increased with increasing glass content from 40 wt% to 50 wt% and decreased as the glass content increased from 50 wt% to 60 wt%. On the contrary, the tendency of the dielectric loss curve was opposite. In general, it could be possible to conclude that the dielectric performance of the composites depended on the sintering bulk densities, microstructures and dielectric properties of each phase. The permittivity of composites consisting of different phases can be evaluated with the empirical logarithmic mixture equation:(3) log κ  =  ∑  ν  i   log κ  i       where νi  and κi  denoted the volume fraction and the permittivity of each phase, respectively [15] . The CBS glass/Al2 O3  LTCC composites were composed of ceramic phase, amorphous glass and pores:(4) log κ  composites   =  ν  ceramic   log κ  ceramic   +  ν  glass   log κ  glass   +  ν  pores   log κ  pores        It was reasonable for the composites of low glass content to have lower permittivity owing to poor densification and a large number of pores. As the glass content increased to 50 wt% that was sufficient to wrap the Al2 O3  particles, the pores gradually disappeared. Resultantly the permittivity of LTCC composites went up. Similarly, composites sintered at 875 °C exhibited superior dielectric characteristics attributing to their better sintering densification. However, the dielectric constant decreased with further increase in glass content to 60 wt% because Al2 O3  had higher permittivity (9.8) [16]  compared with CBS glass (5.9–6.0) and anorthite (6.2) [17] . The dielectric loss of the CBS glass/Al2 O3  composites were shown in  Fig. 5 . The situation could be explained by the sintering densification. Porosity in the composites played a significant role in deteriorating the dielectric loss. The results of some key properties of CBS glass/Al2 O3  LTCC composites prepared with various amount of CBS glass sintered at different temperatures were summarized in  Table 1 . These data in the table reflected the fact that the performance of LTCC composites varied with the glass contents and sintering temperatures. In summary, the CBS glass/Al2 O3  composites prepared with 50 wt% CBS glass and sintered at 875 °C demonstrated the most excellent comprehensive properties: εr  of 8.06 and tanδ of 1.2×10−3  at 7 GHz, flexural strength of 204 MPa, thermal expansion coefficient of 5.47 ppm/°C, and thermal conductivity of 3.1 W/mK. In addition, the comparison between the typical commercial LTCC materials [18]  and the CBS glass/Al2 O3  in this work was given in  Table 2 . The contents of the comparison included these values of sintering temperature, bulk density, dielectric constant (εγ ), dielectric loss (Tanδ), flexural Strength, CTE and λ. It was worth pointing out that the dielectric loss and the thermal expansion of the CBS glass/Al2 O3  composites was lower than most of the commercial LTCC substrate materials. The LTCC composite we prepared simultaneously exhibited high flexural strength, high thermal conductivity, indicating its great potential for packaging in the microelectronic application. To further investigate the co-firing compatibility of the LTCC composites and metal electrodes, glass/Al2 O3  composites prepared with 50 wt% CBS glass were chosen to co-fire with Ag electrodes at 875 °C and 900 °C, and the X-ray diffraction patterns of the co-fired samples was shown in  Fig. 6 . It can be observed that there were only α-Al2 O3  (JCPDS#82-1468), anorthite (JCPDS#41-1486) and Ag phase (JCPDS#04-0783), implying that no chemical reaction have taken place between the glass/Al2 O3  composites and Ag electrodes. Moreover, the SEM micrograph of co-fired sample sintered at 875 °C was showed in  Fig. 7 , which indicated that the LTCC composites matched Ag electrodes well without obvious reaction between them. These results guaranteed the CBS glass/Al2 O3  composite extremely apt for LTCC applications.  4 Conclusions In this study, CaO-B2 O3 -SiO2  (CBS) glass/Al2 O3  composites for LTCC application were synthesized and the sintering behavior, phase compositions, microstructure and properties were investigated. The composites with different CBS glass contents were sintered at different temperatures. Results showed that a proper amount of low melting point glass not only efficiently promoted the sintering densification of the composites, but also significantly improved the dielectric, mechanical and thermal performances. During the sintering process, the chemical reactions between glass and Al2 O3  led to the appearance of anorthite phases. The sintering behaviors and properties were sensitive to the sintering temperatures. The composites prepared with 50 wt% glass sintered at 875 °C for 15 min showed a dense and pore-less microstructure and exhibited quite excellent performance: bulk density of 3.12 g/cm3 , εr  of 8.06 and tanδ of 1.2×10−3  at 7 GHz, flexural strength of 204 MPa, thermal expansion coefficient of 5.47 ppm/°C, and thermal conductivity of 3.1 W/mK. Besides, the composites could meet the shrinkage requirement of Ag electrodes and could hardly react with Ag electrodes. All the above findings demonstrated that the CBS glass/Al2 O3  composites was a promising candidate for LTCC application.

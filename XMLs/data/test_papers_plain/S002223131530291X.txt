                  Optical properties of Er-doped AlN nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by Inert Gas Condensation (IGC) on silicon (111) substrates were investigated. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) were used to study the shapes, morphologies and size of the synthesized AlN:Er3+ NPs which have a spherical shape with a mean diameter between 12nm and 15nm. The optical properties of AlN:Er3+ NPs were assessed from low temperature cathodoluminescence spectra (CL). The CL spectra show visible and near infrared sharp and broad emission lines associated with Er3+ ions. The observed Er3+ ion transition lines broadening is due to the surface defect in studied NPs. Comparative investigations of the luminescent properties of AlN:Er3+NPs with those of AlN:Er3+ thin films show the presence of some similarities between the lattice sites occupied by Er3+ ions in these hosts. It was found that in AlN NPs the Er3+ ion occupy a second optical center which is the VN–Er complex beside the ordinary substitutional ErAl center observed in the case of AlN:Er3+ epilayers. Assuming the presence of these two sites occupied by Er3+ ions, the majority of CL emission lines were attributed. The experimental Stark energy levels of Er3+ ion manifolds are established for the Er-doped AlN NPs and the correspondent crystal field parameters are calculated.

Tel.: +216 74 274 088; fax: +216 74 274 437.      Optical properties of Er-doped AlN nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by Inert Gas Condensation (IGC) on silicon (111) substrates were investigated. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) were used to study the shapes, morphologies and size of the synthesized AlN:Er3+  NPs which have a spherical shape with a mean diameter between 12 nm and 15 nm. The optical properties of AlN:Er3+  NPs were assessed from low temperature cathodoluminescence spectra (CL). The CL spectra show visible and near infrared sharp and broad emission lines associated with Er3+  ions. The observed Er3+  ion transition lines broadening is due to the surface defect in studied NPs. Comparative investigations of the luminescent properties of AlN:Er3+ NPs with those of AlN:Er3+  thin films show the presence of some similarities between the lattice sites occupied by Er3+  ions in these hosts. It was found that in AlN NPs the Er3+  ion occupy a second optical center which is the VN –Er complex beside the ordinary substitutional ErAl  center observed in the case of AlN:Er3+  epilayers. Assuming the presence of these two sites occupied by Er3+  ions, the majority of CL emission lines were attributed. The experimental Stark energy levels of Er3+  ion manifolds are established for the Er-doped AlN NPs and the correspondent crystal field parameters are calculated.

Research on semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) has also witnessed a considerable interest because of their potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics including light emitting devices [1,2] . In addition, these NPs are becoming an indispensable part of functional materials, essentially bridging the gap between biotechnology and material science, with applications in the field of in vivo  imaging, gene therapy, cancer treatment, regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and biomaterials development [3–7] . The III–V nitride semiconductor family (InN, GaN and AlN and their alloys) are technologically important semiconductors because, among other properties, their direct band gaps span a wide region in the electromagnetic spectrum from deep ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR), making them attractive for light emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs) [8,9] . Among the III-nitrides, AlN has gained considerable attention because of its properties such as wide band gap (6.2 eV), high volume resistivity, high thermal conductivity at low temperature, low dielectric constant and excellent thermal expansion coefficient, excellent chemical stability and good mechanical strength [10–13] . Furthermore, AlN NPs are of interest due to their prospective applications in optoelectronic and field emission nano-devices [14–16] . These properties make AlN NPs a suitable host material for rare earth (RE) ions doping, which offers emission over the entire visible spectrum with reduced luminescence quenching as compared to semiconductors with narrower band gaps [17] . Recently, RE-doped NPs have been proposed for a variety of applications including solid state lasers, display, low intensity IR imaging, watermarking technology, 3D storage media, solar cells and other biological probes [18–27] . The synthesis of different NPs has been demonstrated using several methods including, among others, precipitation in solution, sol–gel methods, mechanical attrition and spray pyrolysis [28–31] . Another method for the synthesis of III-nitride NPs is the inert gas condensation (IGC) process. In IGC, the precursors are sputtered by inert gas atoms [32–39] . The advantage of the gas-phase method over other chemical and physical processes is the high-purity level and chemical stability of resulting NPs due to vacuum. Control over cooling rates and residence time in the gas-phase synthesis methods can be obtained by optimizing the process parameters to tailor NPs properties [40] . As the use of RE doped NPs is becoming increasingly important in industrial applications, there is much interest in understanding their optical properties. In the recent years, the optical features of RE-doped oxide semiconductor nanorods as Ga2 O3 , GeO2  and ZnO have been investigated [41–45] . However, the optical investigations of RE-doped III-nitride NPs are rather scarce. In our previous work, we have studied the optical behaviors of AlN:Er3+  and GaN:Yb3+  epilayers [46–49] . Furthermore, we have studied the optical properties of GaN:Yb3+  nanorods and we have compared all the obtained results with those obtained for GaN:Yb3+  epilayers [50] . In the current work, we aim to continue our previous studies by the investigation of the optical behaviors of Er-doped AlN NPs, synthesized by IGC technique on silicon substrate. The synthesized NPs were analyzed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The optical investigations were carried out using low temperature high resolution cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra. The optical centers occupied by Er3+  ions in AlN NPs were identified and compared with those reported for AlN:Er3+  epilayers. The effect of the nano-size on the AlN:Er3+  optical behaviors was discussed. In addition, using the crystal field theory, the Stark energy levels of the Er3+  ions occupying different optical centers have been calculated and compared with those obtained for Er3+  in AlN epilayers.  2 Experimental details The AlN:Er3+  NPs discussed in this paper were developed using IGC synthesis protocol described elsewhere [32,51] . In short, radio frequency (RF) sputtering was used as the source of the material condensed in the presence of argon (Ar) gas in the condensation chamber. The condensation chamber was separated from the deposition chamber by a small nozzle with 2 mm in diameter. The pressure difference between adjusted chambers results in the formation of a NPs beam. The NPs are deposited on the 25×25 mm2  (111) p -type Silicon substrate placed in the deposition chamber. The Silicon substrate is placed precisely in front of the nozzle at a distance of about 1–2 cm. During the deposition process, a target (99.99% of Al disk at 37 nm O.D. with an insert of 99.99% of Er metal pellet) was sputtered in the presence of argon (Ar) and nitrogen (N) gases in ratio 1:1. The ratio of Al to Er metals was 1:8 in terms of their masses. The base pressure of the system was kept up at 10−7  Torr. Sputtering power, pressure difference between the condensation and the deposition chamber, and sputtering time were varied in order to produce NPs of desirable size(s). The effect of the IGC deposition parameters on the NPs size has been discussed elsewhere [32] . The aggregation length describing the distance between nozzle and the sputtering source was kept constant at 10.5 cm. The selected NPs specimens deposited on silicon wafers were heated in vacuum at 500 °C for 1 h and in air at 1000 °C for 2 h, respectively. Structural characterization of the NPs before and after heating was carried out using JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 100 kV. The sizes and morphology of the NPs were observed by a JEM-2010 high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) operated at 200 kV and a scanning near-field optical microscope model WITecR-SNOM-300 s. The CL spectra were measured in 10–300 K temperature range and excited by an electron gun (Electroscan EG5 VSW) with electron beam acceleration energy not exceeding 5 keV. The emission spectra were dispersed by a 0.3 m spectrograph and analyzed by a Princeton Instruments back-illuminated charge- coupled device (CCD) camera with a UV/AR coating, operating in the spectral region 200–1050 nm, and controlled by a computer.  3 Theoretical modeling Er3+  ion has 4f11  configuration which gives rise to a 4 I15/2  ground state and 4 F9/2 , 4 S3/2 , 2 H11/2 , 4 F7/2 , 2 H9/2 , 2 P3/2  excited states in the visible range. All the energy levels of Er3+  ion in AlN host split into Kramers doublet states with E1/2  or E3/2  symmetry in the C 3V  double-rotation group ( C  ¯    3 V   )   [52] . The wave functions and energy levels of these doublets can be calculated through the diagonalization of the operator Hamiltonian:(1) H = H  F I   + H C F     Where H FI   contains all free–ion interactions and H CF   describes the crystal field interactions. The free ion interaction Hamiltonian used in Eq. (1 ) has the form:(2) H  FI   = ∑ k  E  k    e  k   + ξ  4f   A  SO   + α L ( L + 1  )  + β G ( G  2    )  + γ G ( R  7    )  + ∑ i  T  i    t  i   + ∑ k  M  k    m  k   + ∑ k  P  k    p  k       where H  F I     consists of 15 parameters controlling interaction between term multiplets, E  k   (k =1, 2, 3) is the Racah parameters corresponding to linear combinations of Slater radial integrals, α   , β   and γ   are the parameters associated with the two-body effective operators of configuration interaction , L  the orbital angular momentum and G(G2 ) and G(R7 ) being the Casimir operators of the groups G2  and R7 . The T  i    (i  = 2–4, 6–8) is the radial parts of the corresponding three-body effective operators. The M  k   (k  =0, 2, 4) parameters are the magnetic interactions parameters representing the magnetically correlated corrections such as spin–spin and spin–other–orbit interactions, while the P  k   (k =2, 4, 6) parameters arise from electrostatic spin–orbit interactions with higher configurations, with p k  and m k  being the corresponding operators. The remaining free-ion parameter ξ   is the spin–orbit interactions between f  electrons. The crystal-field term, H  CF     , takes into account the effect of the electrostatic interactions due to the surrounding ions on the f electrons. Calculations are usually carried out within the single-particle crystal-field theory. Following the Wybourne formalism [53] , the one-electron H CF   Hamiltonian is expressed as a sum of products of spherical harmonics and real B  k  q     and complex S  k  q     crystal field parameters (CFPs). The expression of HCF  Hamiltonian is given by Eq. (3 ):(3) H  CF   = ∑ k = 2 , 4 , 6   ∑ q = 0  k  [ B  k  q   ( C  k  q   + ( − 1  )  q  C  k  − q    )  + i S  k  q   ( C  k  q   + ( − 1  )  q  C  k  − q    )   ]        where C  k  q     and C  k  − q     are the tensorial operators. The number of non-zero CFPs (B  k  q    and S  k  q     ) in Eq. (3 ) depends on the local site symmetry of the RE ion. For the trigonal symmetry (C 3V  ) occupied by Er3+  ion site in AlN host, the serial development of the crystal-ﬁeld potential involves only six non-zero CFPs  describe as:(4) H  CF   = B  2  0   C  2  0   + B  4  0   C  4  0   + B  6  0   C  6  0   + B  4  3   ( C  4  3   − C  4  − 3   ) + B  6  3   ( C  6  3   − C  6  − 3   ) + B  6  6   ( C  6  6   + C  6  − 6   )      In this current study, the energy levels of Er3+  ion in AlN NPs were calculated by simultaneous treatment of both free ion and crystal-field effects using the entire basis set of wave functions.  4 Results and discussions 4.1 Morphology studies of AlN:Er3+  NPs The morphologies of the AlN:Er3+  NPs were analyzed by TEM to differentiate between the crystalline and amorphous phases of NPs. Moreover, this approach gives reliable information about the synthesized NPs surface.  Fig. 1 (a) shows the TEM images of synthesized AlN:Er3+  NPs which have a spherical shape with a mean diameter of about 12 nm 15 nm, as can be seen from the histogram (Fig. 1 (b)) depicting the statistical size distribution of the NPs. This value has been obtained by fitting the size distribution histogram to a Gaussian function. Furthermore, it can be seen that the particles are uniform in shape and there are no signs of coalescence. The HRTEM images of single NPs having different distinct diameters are shown in  Fig. 2 . The NPs have a crystalline structure with clearly interplanar distances between adjacent crystallographic planes for the AlN:Er3+  NPs. The lattice spacing of 0.19 nm, seen in Fig. 2 (a), corresponds to (102) growth directions of hexagonal AlN. Similarly in Fig. 2 (c), the lattice spacing of 0.54 nm corresponds to (001) direction of hexagonal AlN whereas the lattice spacing of 0.28 nm corresponds to (100)/(010) direction of hexagonal AlN. Because of the particle nano-size, it is expected that the observed NPs lattice parameters can be slightly different from the bulk material due to the surface tension difference (usually enlarged by decreasing the NP diameter). Based on the obtained HRTEM results, we show that most of the studied AlN:Er3+  NPs have hexagonal crystal structure. Small NPs are single crystalline in nature, whereas some large NPs show polycrystalline behavior. The typical AlN:Er3+  NPs sample used in this study has a 85:15 ratio for single-crystalline:poly-crystalline phases. The Fourier transform of HRTEM images for small and large NPs are shown in Fig. 2 (b) and (d). It gives the corresponding orientations of the crystallographic planes for as-deposited AlN:Er3+  NPs. HRTEM indicates that the AlN:Er3+  NPs are hexagonal and relatively uniform.  4.2 Cathodoluminescence spectrum of AlN:Er3+  NPs In the aim to theoretically model the spectral feature of AlN:Er3+  NPs, CL spectra were measured at 11 K and recorded in the 9900 cm−1 –26,500 cm−1  spectral range.  Fig. 3  shows the CL spectrum of AlN:Er3+  NPs grown on silicon substrates recorded at 11 K. It is seen that CL spectrum reveals several groups of peaks corresponding to Er3+  intra-4fn  shell transition originated from different excited states (4 I11/2 , 4 I9/2 , 4 F9/2 , 4 S3/2 , 2 H9/2  and 2 G11/2 ) to (Z1 , Z2 , Z3 ,… Z8 ) 4 I15/2  ground state. As shown in Fig. 3 , the CL spectra of AlN:Er3+  NPs is dominated by green and red bands, corresponding respectively, to the S  3 / 2     4   → I  15 / 2     4      and the F  9 / 2     4   → I  15 / 2     4      transitions. The summary of CL spectra containing 97 emission lines is collected in  Table 1  and in    Figs. 4–6  showing high resolution CL spectra of separated groups of transition lines. These figures clearly show the presence of sharp and broadened emission lines attributed to intra-shell 4f11  transitions of the Er3+  ion configuration. In case of AlN:Er3+  NPs, the broadening of the emission lines observed in CL is expected. In fact, and according to crystal field theory, the electronic energy levels of RE ions in NPs may vary because of changes in the strength of the local electrostatic field and site symmetry [54] . In NPs, structure disordering and surface defects are inevitable, and emission lines in nanocrystalline materials show extra inhomogeneous broadening with regards to bulk crystals, especially due to the enormous increase in surface sites compared to bulk sites [55] . The broadening of some of the Er3+  ion emission lines observed in the AlN:Er3+  CL spectra means that the Er3+  ion luminescence is affected by the generated surface defects which contribute on the optical behavior of Er3+  ion incorporated to AlN NPs. It is also worth mentioning that the erbium related luminescence line width broadening suggests that the Er3+  ions most probably occupy more than one optical center in AlN NPs. The discussion of these different optical centers occupied by Er3+  ion in AlN NPs will be presented in the next section. Specifically, In order to understand the effect of the nano-dimension and the surface defects on the optical properties of Er3+  ion, we have compared CL spectra obtained for the AlN:Er3+  NPs synthesized by the IGC method with CL spectra of the AlN:Er3+  epilayers reported in our previous work [48] .   Fig. 7  show the assembly of CL spectra of AlN:Er3+  NPs and epilayers in 16000–26200 cm−1  spectral range. (Fig. 8 ). Comparison of these CL spectra evinces the presence of the same 4f–4f transitions corresponding to the S  3 / 2     4   , H  9 / 2     2   → I  15 / 2     4      transitions located at 17,888 cm−1  and 24310 cm−1 ; however, the CL spectrum for AlN:Er3+  NPs does not show any noticeable emission lines originating from the 2 H11/2  and 4 F7/2  manifolds as observed in the CL spectra of AlN:Er3+  epilayer [48] . In addition, we note that the CL spectra of AlN:Er3+  epilayer is dominated by the blue emission corresponding to F  7 / 2     4   → I  15 / 2     4      transition. Whereas, in the case of AlN:Er3+  NPs, we note the dominance of red and green emission lines corresponding, respectively, to F  9 / 2     4   , S  3 / 2     4   → I  15 / 2     4      transitions. The enhancement of red and green bands and the quenching of the blue emission from Er3+  ion incorporated in AlN NPs can be explained by the presence of (de)populating channels of 4 F9/2  and 4 S3/2  levels from the 4 F7/2  excited states. Among these possible energy transfer pathways, we believe that the multiphonon relaxation and the non-radiative cross relaxation (CR) processes, which occurs between neighboring Er3+  ions in AlN NPs are the most probable to occur. A simplified energy levels diagram of Er3+  ion in AlN NPs shown in  Fig. 9  illustrates the possible mechanisms of observed emission and energy transfer processes. It is well known that in Er-doped AlN epilayers, having a low dopant concentration, Er3+  ions are usually randomly distributed in the host lattice and the neighboring Er3+  ions distances are too far apart resulting in a decrease of the energy transfer probability between the Er3+  ions. Because of that, one can observed blue emission from the 4 F7/2  manifold in the AlN epilayers. However, in case of the AlN:Er3+  NPs and due to the nano-size dimension, some of the Er3+  ions have closer nearest neighbors resulting in various CR processes between Er3+  ions. This in fact can depopulate the 4 F7/2  level and result in effective quenching of radiative emission from this energy state. The related mechanism can be described as follows, in the case of AlN NPs, the short distances between Er3+  ions in AlN host lattice favor interionic interactions, resulting an efficient near resonant CR processes between Er3+  ions, (F  7 / 2     4   → F  9 / 2     4     ) and (I  15 / 2     4   → I  13 / 2     4     ) transitions, as shown in Fig. 9 . The 4 F9/2  states became greatly populated from 4 F7/2  states through the CR process resulting in intense red emission observed in the CL spectra of ALN:Er3+  NPs. Furthermore, the 4 F7/2  states decay nonradiatively to the 4 S3/2  states, resulting in observing green emission lines attributed to S  3 / 2     4   → I  15 / 2     4      transition. The disappearance of the 2 H11/2  transition in the AlN:Er3+  NPs CL spectra can also be explained by the CR process between Er3+  ions, (H  11 / 2     2   → F  9 / 2     4     ) and (I  13 / 2     4   → I  11 / 2     4     ) transitions (see Fig. 9 ).   5 Optical luminescent centers of AlN:Er3+  NPs In general, density function theory is used to investigate RE impurities in the III–V (AlN,GaN) host [56–58] . Based on available theoretical models, there is a common consensus that the most stable site for the RE3+  ion in a GaN host is a Ga substitutional site. On the other hand, recent theoretical calculations also suggest that it is energetically favorable for incorporated RE ions to create centers such as the VN –RE complexes involving a nitrogen vacancy defects, which are very common defects in the GaN and AlN hosts [59] . We have reported recently, the presence of two main optical centers in the case of GaN:Yb3+  nanorods (NRs), which are the substitutional YbGa  and the complex Yb–VN  sites [50] . It was shown that the reduced dimensionality of the GaN host (nano-size) promotes the formation of VN –Yb complexes involving VN  defects at the expense of the substitutional (RESI) center formation. In order to investigate the optical centers occupied by the Er3+  ions in the AlN NPs, we have presented in the same Fig. 8  the CL spectra corresponding to the 4 S3/2 →  4 I15/2  transitions observed for AlN:Er3+  NPs and epilayer hosts. It is clearly seen that in the case of AlN:Er3+  NPs, the presence of the same emission lines as observed for AlN:Er3+  epilayer, along with additional emission lines not observed in AlN:Er3+  epilayer confirms the postulate about Er3+  ion occupying more than one center in the AlN NPs host. We have demonstrated that in the case of Er3+  doped AlN epilayers the dominant optical center occupied by the Er3+  ion is the substitutional ErAl  site (RESI) [48] . However, the presence of new emission lines observed in the CL of AlN:Er3+  NPs confirms the existence of another optical center, which is the VN –Er complex, such as obtained in the case of GaN:Yb NRs [50] . The analysis of presented experimental results leads us to presume the presence of an additional optical center occupied by the Er3+  ion in studied AlN NPs. Based on the reasoning presented above, we propose that it is the complex Er–VN . In the following we will confirm this assumption by conducting the detailed theoretical analysis of the CL spectra (see Figs. 4–6 ) obtained for the AlN:Er3+  NPs at low temperature. We assigned the broad emission lines seen in Fig. 4  to I  9 / 2     4   → I  15 / 2     4      transition to the additional optical center (VN –Er complex) which can be located e.g.  at near of AlN NPs surface. This assignment is confirmed by the fact that in case of RE-doped nanocrystals, the REs ions can be located partially inside of the NPs (RESI center) as well as at AlN NPs surface (complex centers) [60] . In fact, one can expect that the incorporation of Er in the NPs volume is smaller than that in an epilayer volume [17] . This prevents the formation of RESI center and promotes the formation of Er–VN  complexes involving nitrogen vacancy (VN ). It is well known that the exciton Bohr radius of the AlN host is less than a few angstroms [61] . Therefore, quantum size confinement in AlN NPs having 12 nm diameter should not affect the localized electronic states of the Er3+  ion localized 4f-shell electrons. So, it is expected that the Stark splitting of Er3+  ion manifolds when doped to single crystal AlN epilayers or AlN NPs should be very close. The detailed analysis of the observed emission lines of Er3+  ions in AlN NPs will be presented in the next section.  6 Modeling of the Er3+  ion energy levels in AlN NPs grown on silicon substrates Using the formalism developed by Racah and Norman [62,63] , the experimental Stark energy levels of Er3+  in AlN NPs were numerically simulated. It is known that rigorous simulation needs a clear experimental support. The specimens studied here are composed of NPs having varied diameter (see Fig. 1 ). Thus, one can expect that the probability of surface defects occurrence in AlN:Er3+  NPs increases for smaller diameter NPs. Considering the fact that the CL spectra were collected over a large surface area (>0.5 mm2 ), considered here as global CL spectra, the observed emission from optically active Er3+  ions occupying different sites in NPs having different diameter cannot be spatially resolved. Therefore, the presence of broad Er3+  ion emission lines (I 9 / 2     4  , G 11 / 2     4  → I 15 / 2     4    ) in CL spectra are most probably resulting from the superposition of sharp transition lines generated by individual NP having different surface to volume ratio. In order to analyze these observed Er3+  ion emission lines in detail, we have used the multi-Gaussian fitting as shown in Figs. 4  and 6 . Base on the global CL spectra of AlN:Er3+  NPs, we have established two sets of experimental Er3+  ion Stark energy levels, corresponding to the purely ErAl  substitutional site without defects involve in the RESI center and the VN –Er complex. The calculated and experimental energy levels of Er3+  ion occupying substitutional (R) and complex (C) centers in AlN:Er3+  NPs deposited on silicon substrates are shown in  Table 2 . The calculated energy levels of Er3+ ions were obtained by diagonilazing the Hamiltonian described in Section 3 . It should be noted that the Er3+  ion Stark energy level calculations are performed for the ordinary substitutional ErAl  site with trigonal symmetry (C 3v ). In case of the VN –Er defect complex, we have assumed in calculations that it has the same symmetry as the ErAl  substitutional site (C 3v ) with some distortion [50] . The fitting procedure executed here and described in our previous work [64] , assumes the selection of adequate sets of free-ion and crystal-field parameters. Since H  F I     is expected to be largely independent of the host we have used the parameters which were determined previously for the Er3+  ion in AlN epilayers [48]  as starting set of free-ion parameters. However, it should be mentioned that M  k   and P  k    parameters were not varied in the present fitting procedure. The free ion parameters obtained by the fitting procedure are shown in  Table 3 . Indeed, it was found that these values are close to those reported in our earlier study for Er3+  ions in AlN epilayers [48] . For the initial CFPs, we have started the fitting process from the initial CFPs used in the case of AlN: Er3+  epilayers obtained by lattice-sum calculations [46–50] . The parameter values used as a reference point in order to fit the obtained experimental Stark energy levels of Er3+  ion in AlN NPs are collected along with those obtained from the best fit in Table 3 . The fitting process involved 97 experimentally observed Er3+  ion energy levels observed between energies of 9900 cm−1  and 26,200 cm−1  in the data fitting process. The resulting root mean square deviation is about 3.6 cm−1  in the case of Er3+  ion occupying the substitutional center (RESI) and 2.1 cm−1  for the VN –Er complex that confirms the fitting procedure consistency. The good agreement between the calculated and the experimental Stark energy levels (see Table 2 ) confirms the proposal that the Er3+  ions in AlN NPs occupy beside the purely substitutional Al center, a second optical center which is the VN –Er complex.  7 Conclusion In this study, AlN:Er3+  NPs were deposited on silicon substrates by using the IGC method. The majority of AlN:Er3+  NPs have spherical shapes with a mean diameter of about 12 nm. The homogeneity of NPs observed using HRTEM confirmed good crystallinity of NPs regardless of their diameter. The CL spectra of AlN:Er3+  NPs were investigated and compared with those reported for AlN:Er3+ epilayers. The comparison of the optical features of Er3+  ion incorporated in AlN NPs and to AlN epilayers shows the presence of the substitutional ErAl  and the VN –Er complex centers. This complex center is primarily associated with the NPs surface. The Stark energy levels of Er3+  ions in AlN NPs were calculated using the crystal field theory assuming the presence of two optical centers with C3v  symmetry. The calculated Er3+  ion manifolds splitting are in good agreement with the experimental values which confirms that the Er3+  ions in AlN NPs occupy two sites, the substitutional (ErGa ) and the complex (VN –Er) centers, respectively.

                  GdVO4:Yb3+, Er3+ powder was synthesized by a conventional solid state reaction. The XRD pattern confirmed that the GdVO4:Yb3+, Er3+ powder phosphors have tetragonal structure. The up-conversion photoluminescence (UCPL) spectrum consisted of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (554 nm) transition. The UCPL intensity of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) is stronger than 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (554 nm) by adjusting Yb3+ concentrations. In order to explain this behavior, we investigated a pump power dependence.

GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+  powder was synthesized by a conventional solid state reaction. The XRD pattern confirmed that the GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+  powder phosphors have tetragonal structure. The up-conversion photoluminescence (UCPL) spectrum consisted of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (554 nm) transition. The UCPL intensity of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) is stronger than 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (554 nm) by adjusting Yb3+  concentrations. In order to explain this behavior, we investigated a pump power dependence.   Graphical abstract       Keywords Upconversion  GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+   Energy transfer    1 Introduction Generally, luminescence occurs when low photon energy is emitted after the absorption of high photon energy, but up-conversion photoluminescence (UCPL) is a nonlinear optical process that can generate one high-photon energy from two or more low photons energy. However, the use of ultraviolet excitation causes the photo-degradation of phosphor materials, resulting in a loss of the luminescence efficiency and performance of the device. The UC process does not cause this photodegradation, because of the infrared excitation of its materials by a 975 nm laser diode. Therefore, UC materials have recently received attention from researchers because of their potential applications in, for examples, display technologies, medical diagnostics, drug carriers and photovoltaic cells [1–10] . Gadolinium orthovanadate (GdVO4 ) based phosphor have interesting luminescent properties such as chemical stability and machine property. Gd3+ ion can be easily substituted with lanthanide ions because of the equal valence and similar ionic radius. Rare-earth ions doped vanadate compounds as phosphors, which can emit various colors and efficiently excited because of the strong absorption of the VO4 3−  groups and efficient energy transfer from host material to activator [11–16] . Among the rare-earth ions, Yb3+  ion has a broad absorption spectrum in the range from 850 to 1100 nm. The Yb3+  ion as sensitizer can be effectively excited by incident energy that is transferred to the activator. The Er3+ ion as an activator is the luminescence center of the UC particles. The Er3+ ion is suitable for the UC processes due to the unique energy-level scheme, it is possible that the excited energy of the Yb3+  ion (2F7/2-2F5/2) directly transfer to Er3+ ion (4I15/2-4I11/2). Therefore, the co-doped Yb3+  ion with Er3+ ion can enhance the UC efficiency from infrared to visible light [17–20] . In this paper, the GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+  powder were synthesized by using a solid state reaction method. In addition, the effects of the processing conditions on the surface morphology, up-conversion luminescence of the GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+  phosphors excited at 975 nm and the up-conversion mechanism were also discussed.  2 Experimental details GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+  powders were prepared by a planetary ball mill from stoichiometric amounts of Gd2 O3  (99.9%, Aldrich), V2 O5  (99.6+ %, Aldrich), Er2 O3 (99.9%, Aldrich), Yb2 O3  (99.99%, Aldrich, with 0.01–0.15 mol). The planetary ball milling was done with a rotation speed of 350 rpm for 50 min and interruption time for 10 min. It was repeated for 10 times. The planetary balling using hard material ZrO balls (diameter of 10 mm). The powder samples were sintered at 1000 °C for 5 h, respectively, then the polycrystalline GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+  was obtained. The XRD data were collected in the range of 15–70° for scan speed 2°/min by using Philips, X'pert-MPD system X-ray diffractometer with 3 kW Cu-Кα (λ = 1.54056 Å) X-ray tube. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, JSM-6700, JEOL) attached to a scanning electron microscope was used for chemical analysis. The surface morphology of the powders was examined by scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-6700, JEOL). A 975 nm continuous wave laser diode was employed as the pumping source to obtain the luminescence spectra. The emitted light was focused into a 75 cm monochromator and detected by a thermoelectrically cooled photomultiplier tube. The signal was fed to a digital oscilloscope.  3 Results and discussion The schematic representation of tetragonal crystal structure of GdVO4  is illustrated in Fig. 1  . The structural parameters with atomic coordinates in Table 1   are used for modeling the unit cell [21] . From Fig. 1 , the eight oxygen atoms are coordinated to the central Gd3+ ion forming a dodecahedral sublattice. And also, distorted tetrahedral structure having the bond angles of 100.537 and 114.115 is observed by bonding the four oxygen atoms with central vanadate atom. Fig. 2   shows the XRD patterns of GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+  powders sintered at 1000 °C with various Yb3+  concentrations. The diffraction peaks in Fig. 2 , were in good agreement with the standard JCPDS (17-0260) cards for GdVO4 . All these patterns are readily indexed into tetragonal system with space group I41 /amd , and their lattice parameter values around a = b = 7.2126 Å, c = 6.3483 Å. The sharp peaks indicated that the samples were synthesized well with the highly crystalline materials. The GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+  phosphors were grown as the polycrystalline phase with a main peak (200), (112) and (312). Fig. 3   shows FE-SEM images of the GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+  powders sintering for various Yb3+  concentrations, respectively. The efficient luminescence of phosphor materials is determined by optimization of chemical composition, particle size distribution and morphology. Among these factors, the spherical morphology is an important factor for the more efficient luminescence. It plays role to lower light scattering at the surfaces as well as higher packing densities [22] . The FE-SEM images show the difference in morphology as a function of various Yb3+  concentrations. The particle size and surface morphology of the phosphors are similar with Yb3+  concentrations from 0.01 mol to 0.07 mol. On the other hand, the particle size of the phosphors are increased with the increase Yb3+  concentrations from 0.10 mol to 0.15 mol. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was used to examine the elemental composition of Yb3+  0.1 mol and Er3+  0.03 mol co-doped sample sintered at 1000 °C (Fig. 4  ). EDX confirmed the presence of gadolinium (Gd), vanadium (V), oxygen (O), ytterbium (Yb) and erbium (Er). As shown in Fig. 4 , the other component was not determined in the GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+  powders. The GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+  powders exhibit up-conversion luminescence by excitation with 975 nm light. Fig. 5   shows the emission spectrum of GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+ . The spectrum consists of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (554 nm) transition. Fig. 6   shows the UCPL intensity of the green emission behavior as a function of the Yb3+  contents. As shown in Fig. 6 , the UCPL intensity of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (554 nm) transition depends on the Yb3+  contents. The UCPL intensity of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) transition increased with increasing Yb3+  contents from 0.01 to 0.1 mol and decreasing Yb3+  contents above 0.1 mol. However, the UCPL intensity of 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (554 nm) transition increase with increasing Yb3+  contents from 0.01 to 0.07 mol and decreasing Yb3+  contents above 0.07 mol. The UC luminescence intensity ratio of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) to 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (554 nm) increases, which is due to the improved absorption of Er3+ and Yb3+  by local thermal effect. The energy separation between the nearest excited states 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 is about several hundred wavenumbers, the population distribution on two excited state (2H11/2 and 4S3/2) is determined by the thermal distribution. Thus, the intensity ratio of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) to 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (554 nm) is very sensitive to local temperature [23–25] . The energy level scheme is illustrated in Fig. 7  , which describe the UC mechanism of Yb3+  and Er3+ ions in GdVO4  host lattice. In the case of the green emission, the absorption of the IR pump photon excites the Er3+ ion from the ground state to the 4I11/2 state. The second IR pump photon accelerates the excitation of the Er3+ ion to the 4F7/2 state. Then, the excited Er3+ ion decays non-radiatively and rapidly to the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels. The excited energy relaxes to the ground state with two radiative transitions: 2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2. It is called the excited state absorption (ESA) process. However, the ESA processes of Er3+ ions are neglected. Because the Yb3+  ion has a much larger absorption cross section and an efficient energy transfer to Er3+ ions under laser excitation of 975 nm [26] . Therefore, the energy transfer upconversion (ETU) process has occurred better than the ESA process. In the ETU process, the absorption of the IR pump photon excites the Yb3+  and Er3+ ions to the 2F5/2 and 4I11/2 levels, respectively. Subsequently, the excited energy of the Yb3+  ion is transferred to 4I11/2 state of the Er3+ ion. The Er3+ ion is excited to the 4F7/2 level, and then it decays non-radiatively to 2H11/2 and 4S3/2. Consequently, the excited energy relaxes to the ground state with two radiative transitions: 2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2. The red emission indicates the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition, and the 4F9/2 state can be populated from 4S3/2 by non-radiative relaxation. However, the non-radiative relaxation rate from 4S3/2 to 4F9/2 is very low because the energy gap between 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 is approximately 3150 cm−1 , which is larger than the optical phonon energy of the GdVO4  (805 cm−1 ) [27] . The non-radiative relaxation rate from 4I11/2 to 4I13/2 is very low. Therefore, the GdVO4  co-doped with Yb3+  and Er3+ shows green emission only for the ETU process. In order to investigation for pump power dependence, the laser diode's power changed from 100 to 900 mW. The pump power-dependence of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (554 nm) transition are shown in Fig. 8   as log–log plots of the emission intensity versus input pump power. The number of photons required to satisfy the upper emission state can be obtained by the following relation [28] :I up   ∞ P n      where I up is the upconversion emission intensity, P  is the power of the pump laser and n  is the number of photons. Fig. 8  shows that the n value of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (554 nm) transition at 0.07 and 0.1 mol was approximately 1.84, 2.10 and 1.59, 1.98, respectively. The calculated n  value is reduced, which is due to population distribution of Er3+. In Fig. 8 , the UCPL intensity of GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+  powders decreased with increasing the laser diode's power from 700 to 900 mW. This is due to saturation in the up-conversion process at higher power. Higher pump power increases the competition between decay and upconversion for the depletion of the intermediate excited states, resulting in a significantly reduced slope [29] . Therefore, the calculated n value confirms a two or three photon process for green emission.  4 Conclusions In summary, the GdVO4 :Yb3+ , Er3+  powders were synthesized using a solid state reaction method in different Yb3+  concentrations. The composition and morphology were analyzed by EDS and FE-SEM. A green emission centered at 525 and 554 nm under excitation by a 975 nm laser diode, was observed. Increasing the concentration of Yb3+  also increased the intensity of the green emission. When the concentration of the Yb3+  is 0.01 mol, the UC intensity of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) to 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (554 nm) is increases. This is due to the population distribution for 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 level of Er3+ ions, and the population distribution is determined by thermal distribution.

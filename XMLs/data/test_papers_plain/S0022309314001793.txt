                  Li2O–PbO–B2O3–P2O5 glasses containing different concentrations of Cr2O3 ranging from 0 to 1mol% were synthesized by melt quenching technique. The amorphous nature of the glasses was asserted by X-ray diffractometry. The dielectric properties i.e., dielectric constant (ε′), loss factor (tanδ) and a.c. conductivity (σac) over a range of frequency 103–106
                     Hz in the temperature range 303–573K have been carried out on these samples. The results have been analyzed in the light of different oxidation states of chromium ions with the help of data on infrared, optical absorption and ESR spectra. The analysis of the results indicates that when the concentration of Cr2O3 is increased in the glass matrix the Cr3+ ions which act as modifiers with CrO6 structural units increase. The Cr6+ ions which enter the network as glass formers with CrO4
                     2− structural units decrease with increase in dopant concentration.

Li2 O–PbO–B2 O3 –P2 O5  glasses containing different concentrations of Cr2 O3  ranging from 0 to 1 mol% were synthesized by melt quenching technique. The amorphous nature of the glasses was asserted by X-ray diffractometry. The dielectric properties i.e., dielectric constant (ε′), loss factor (tanδ) and a.c. conductivity (σac ) over a range of frequency 103 –106  Hz in the temperature range 303–573 K have been carried out on these samples. The results have been analyzed in the light of different oxidation states of chromium ions with the help of data on infrared, optical absorption and ESR spectra. The analysis of the results indicates that when the concentration of Cr2 O3  is increased in the glass matrix the Cr3 +  ions which act as modifiers with CrO6  structural units increase. The Cr6 +  ions which enter the network as glass formers with CrO4 2 −  structural units decrease with increase in dopant concentration.   Keywords Chromium doped glasses  Optical band gap  ESR spectra  Dielectric properties  Dielectric breakdown strength    1 Introduction Nowadays much attention is paid towards borophosphate glasses due to their low refractive index, menial dispersion, remarkable optical properties and high transparency from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared region [1,2] . The chemical durability of borophosphate glasses doped with transition metals is greater than that of phosphate glasses due to the composition boron oxide in the glass network, mostly in the form of BO4  tetrahedral, which transforms metaphosphate chain into three-dimensional network [3] . Due to these special properties, these glasses are used as materials for optical components such as tunable solid state lasers, optical materials, optical filters, IR domes, memories, modulators, luminescence materials, phosphors, solar energy converters, fiber optic communication devices, radiation dosimetry, cathode materials in batteries and in a number of electronic gadgets [4–10] . The conductivity of borate glasses integrated with multivalent transition metal ions can be enhanced by adding Li2 O to the glass network. The mixed electronic and ionic conduction of these glasses depend on the glass composition. Among all the transition metal ions, chromium ions have attracted the attention of researchers due to their extraordinary absorption and emission properties when they occupy the octahedral positions in the host glass [11] . Chromium, a quite economical ion when dissolved in the glass network even in a very small concentration makes the glass colored and influences the optical and dielectric properties very strongly [12] . Cr3 +  ion is used to explore the structure and local symmetry of new glass materials. In glass phases these ions occupy different sites with different field strengths due to changes in position and compositional disorder. Glasses combined with mixed valence chromium ions are used as cathode materials in rechargeable batteries because of their high energy density and lofty capacitance [12,13] . Chromium ions are expected to increase or decrease the chemical durability, mechanical strength and conductivity of the glasses hence they occupy in different oxidation states. These ions exist in glasses in Cr3 +  states with CrO6  structural units (acting as modifiers), Cr5 +  and Cr6 +  states with CrO4 3 −  and CrO4 2 −  structural units respectively (playing the role of glass formers) basing on the quantitative properties of glass formers, modifiers, size of the ions in the glass network, their field strength and mobility of the modifying cation [14–16] . Literature survey on borophosphate glasses reveals that most of the studies on these glasses are confined to structural investigation by means of DSC, spectroscopic studies etc. Particularly, no considerable studies on dielectric properties (dielectric constant ε′, loss factor tanδ, a.c. conductivity σac  and dielectric breakdown strength) of chromium doped lithium lead borophosphate glasses are available. These studies are vital in estimating the conductivity and topology of the glasses. The main objective of the present investigation is to make a comprehensive study on the influence of chromium ions on the structural aspects of lithium lead borophosphate glasses from a systematic study on dielectric properties and spectroscopic studies such as optical absorption, FTIR and ESR spectra.  2 Experimental details In the present investigation, the particular glass composition 20Li2 O–20PbO–45B2 O3 –(15 − x) P2 O5 : xCr2 O3  (x ranging from 0 to 1 mol%) was chosen. The glass samples are labeled as follows.C0: 20Li2 O–20PbO–45B2 O3 –15P2 O5   C1: 20Li2 O–20PbO–45B2 O3 –14.9P2 O5 : 0.1Cr2 O3   C2: 20Li2 O–20PbO–45B2 O3 –14.7P2 O5 : 0.3Cr2 O3   C3: 20Li2 O–20PbO–45B2 O3 –14.5P2 O5 : 0.5Cr2 O3   C4: 20Li2 O–20PbO–45B2 O3 –14.2P2 O5 : 0.8Cr2 O3   C5: 20Li2 O–20PbO–45B2 O3 –14.0P2 O5 : 1.0Cr2 O3     Analytical grade reagents of Li2 CO3 , PbO, H3 BO3  and Cr2 O3  were taken in proportionate amounts and amalgamated stoichiometrically in an agate mortar and melted in a porcelain crucible at 1223 K for 40 min in an automatic temperature controlled furnace. The bubble free, transparent melt was poured in a brass mold and subsequently annealed at 573 K. The dopant free sample (C0) was appeared to be clear, transparent and white in color; thereafter the color of the samples (from C1 to C5) was noticed to change from light green to dark green. The amorphous nature of the glasses was reflected from the X-ray diffraction spectra of the specimen recorded with Philips X-pert system using the step-scan method with Cu-Kα  radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) operated at 40 kV, 25 mA; a step size of 0.04° and a collection time of 2 s per point over the 2θ range. The density of the samples was estimated to an accuracy of ± 0.0001 g/cm3  using the VIBRA HT Model a programmable density measurement kit using O-xylene (99.99% pure) as an immersion liquid. The refractive index of the glasses was determined by the Abbe refractometer NAR-4T Atago model, Japan, using methyl iodide containing sulfur solution (μD  = 1.78) as contact liquid, with light source of LED lamp (approximating to yellow color wavelength). The glass samples of 1 mm thickness were devised by cutting, grinding and polishing for recording the optical absorption spectra in the wavelength range 200–1000 nm with a resolution of 0.1 nm using the double beam UV–VIS–NIS spectrophotometer. The powdered samples of 100 mg were taken in a quartz tube for ESR studies. The ESR spectra of the samples were obtained using JOEL-FE-1X operating at the X-band frequency (ν ~ 9.154 GHz) with field modulation frequency of 100 kHz. The magnetic field was scanned from 0 to 500 mT and micropower of 10 mW was used. The FTIR spectra of the glasses were recorded in the wavenumber range from 400 to 1250 cm− 1  with the help of a JASCO FTIR 6200 spectrophotometer by the KBr pellet method. For dielectric measurements, the samples were ground flat to the dimensions of 1 cm × 1 cm × 0.2 cm and polished to higher extent. A thin layer of silver paint was applied on both sides of the samples, in order to serve as electrodes for dielectric studies. LF-impedance analyzer (Hewlett-Packard model 4192A) was used in the frequency range 103 –106  Hz to measure the dielectric constant (ε′), loss factor (tanδ) and a.c. conductivity (σac ) over a range of temperature 303–573 K. The accuracy in the measurement of dielectric constant is ~ 0.01 and dielectric loss is ~ 0.001. The dielectric breakdown strength of all the samples was estimated at room temperature in air medium using a high ac voltage breakdown tester (ITL Model BOV-7, Hyderabad) operated with an input voltage of 230 V at a frequency of 50 Hz.  3 Results 3.1 Characterization and physical parameters The fabricated glasses are free from visible defects like bubbles, cracks and inclusions. The X-ray diffraction spectra of C0, C1 and C4 glasses are shown in Fig. 1  . No sharp Bragg peaks are observed in the spectra which indicate the amorphous nature of the glasses. However, a small hump in the spectra reveals the short range order of the glass samples. The physical parameters such as chromium ion concentration Ni , mean chromium ion separation ri , polaron radius rp  and molar volume Vm  are evaluated and mentioned in Table 1   along with the refractive indices of glasses. The measured density of chromium free sample is found to be 3.564 g/cm3  and is found to increase with increase in the dopant concentration. A similar trend in refractive index and a reverse trend in molar volume of samples are noticed and recorded in Table 1 . Among all the prepared glass samples the maximum value of density is 3.621 g/cm3  for C5 glass.  3.2 Optical absorption Fig. 2   shows the optical absorption spectra of Li2 O–PbO–B2 O3 –P2 O5  glasses added with different concentrations of Cr2 O3 , at room temperature in the wavelength range 250–850 nm. No absorption peaks are found in the spectrum of pure sample C0 as it is radical free. When chromium ions are incorporated in the glass system then the spectra exhibit two intense absorption bands, with band positions at 438 nm (22,831 cm− 1 ), 625 nm (16,000 cm− 1 ). Besides this another three feeble bands are identified at 351 nm (28,490 cm− 1 ), 644 nm (15,528 cm− 1 ) and 691 nm (14,472 cm− 1 ). All these bands are noticed to shift to higher wavelength side. The intensity of the bands at 438 and 625 nm is observed to increase with increase in dopant concentration. The fundamental absorption edge reveals the band structure around the energy gap. The absorption edge at 299 nm for C0 glass is red shifted to 342 nm (C5 glass) with gradual increase in concentration of chromium ions. Optical energy band gap Eg  of the glasses is determined from the Tauc plots drawn between hν and (αhν)1/2  by extrapolating the linear region to x-axis where (αhν)1/2  = 0 as shown in Fig. 3  . The gradual decrease in optical band gap is noticed with increase in the concentration of Cr2 O3 . The optical band gap is observed to be high for C0 glass (4.29 eV) and low for C5 glass (3.37 eV). Urbach energy (∆E) which gives the crucial information about the density of energy states in the band gap is evaluated from the plots drawn between photon energy hν versus ln α(ν) values. The relation between α(ν) and Urbach energy (∆E) is given by the Urbach law as follows [17] (1) α υ  = C  exp hυ / ΔE       where C is constant and ΔE is the Urbach energy interpreted as the energy gap between localized tail states in the forbidden region. ΔE values are acquired by taking the reciprocals of the slopes of the linear region of the ln α(υ) versus hυ plots as shown in Fig. 4  . The evaluated ΔE values which are found to increase with the concentration of chromium ions are mentioned in Table 2  . The minimum and maximum values of ΔE for C0 and C5 glasses are 0.2536 eV and 0.6015 eV respectively. Inset of Fig. 4  shows the variation of optical band gap and Urbach energy with concentration of dopant. Theoretical optical basicity values of all glasses are evaluated by Eq. (2) [18]  and included in Table 2 .(2) Λ th  = ∑ i = 1  n  Z i  r i   Z 0   γ i          where ‘n’ is the number of cations present, Zi  is the oxidation number of ith cation, ri  is the ratio of the number of ith cation to the number of oxides present, Z0  is oxidation number of oxide and γi  is the basicity moderating parameter of the ith cation. γi  values are calculated using Eq. (3) [19] .(3) γ i  = 1.36 x i  − 0.26       where ‘xi ’ is the Pauling electronegativity of cation. The optimum value of optical basicity is 0.4474 for C0 system and observed to increase with increase in content of chromium ions and its maximum value is 0.4537 for M6 glass matrix.  3.3 ESR spectra The ESR spectra of Li2 O–PbO–B2 O3 –P2 O5 : Cr2 O3  glasses recorded at room temperature are shown in Fig. 5  . As there is no paramagnetic impurity in an undoped (C0) glass, no ESR signal is detected. When the pure glass is doped with different concentrations of Cr2 O3  the spectrum of each glass gives two resonance signals. The spectrum exhibits a weak, low field resonance signal with effective g value centered at 5.23 and a strong high field resonance signal at 1.986. The intensity of the two signals is found to increase with hike in concentration of chromium ions but no change in g values is noticed.  3.4 FTIR spectra The structural analysis of Li2 O–PbO–B2 O3 –P2 O5 : Cr2 O3  glasses are apprehended by infrared spectroscopy in the wavenumber range 400–1250 cm− 1 . The band positions and their respective assignments are furnished in Table 3  . The infrared spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 6  . The spectrum of pure sample shows the absorption bands at 1193 cm− 1  (identified due to the stretching vibrations of triangular BO3  structural units), 1108 cm− 1  (assigned to PO2 −  symmetrical stretching vibrations), 1029 cm− 1  (attributed to stretching vibrations of tetrahedral BO4  units), 926 cm− 1  (due to P O P asymmetric vibrations), 779 cm− 1  (due to P O P symmetric vibrations), 694 cm− 1  (due to B O B bending vibrations) and 451 cm− 1  (vibrations due to PbO4  structural units). Two new bands are identified due to the doping of Cr2 O3  at 882 and 431 cm− 1  due to ν3 -vibrations of CrO4 2 −  structural units and ν4  vibrations of Cr2 O3  units respectively. Due to the addition of chromium ions to the pure glass matrix, the intensity of the bands due to BO3  structural units, P O P asymmetric vibrations, B O B bending vibrations and vibrations of Cr2 O3  units is observed to increase with a shift in the band position towards higher wavenumber. A reverse trend is noticed for the bands assigned to PO2 −  symmetrical stretching vibrations, stretching vibrations of tetrahedral BO4  units, ν3 -vibrations of CrO4 2 −  structural units and vibrations due to PbO4  structural units shifting the band position towards lower wavenumber. Interestingly the band due to P O P symmetric vibrations is blue shifted with a fall in the intensity of the band.  3.5 Dielectric properties The values of ε′ and tanδ at lab temperature (303 K) of C0 glass at 500 kHz are measured to be 3.25 and 0.008 respectively; these values are decreased significantly with increase in frequency. When pure glass is doped with increasing concentrations of Cr2 O3  at room temperature the values of ε′ and tanδ are found to increase at any frequency. Fig. 7   shows the temperature dependence of dielectric constant for different glass samples at 10 kHz. It is noticed that the rate of increase of ε′ with temperature increases with the concentration of Cr2 O3 . The inset shows the variation of dielectric constant with temperature at different frequencies for C2 glass matrix. The values of ε′ are observed to increase slowly up to about 353 K and beyond this temperature; they are noticed to increase sharply and highly frequency dependent with large values at lower frequencies. The same trend is witnessed for all the other glass samples. The plots drawn between tanδ versus temperature also demonstrated the similar type of behavior as shown by ε′ versus temperature. The variation of dielectric loss with temperature at 1 kHz for different concentrations of Cr2 O3  is shown in Fig. 8  . The inset shows the variation of tanδ with temperature at different frequencies for C5 glass. The plots of pure and chromium doped glasses have exhibited distinct maxima, with increase in frequency these maxima shift towards higher temperature, showing the dielectric relaxation character of dielectric loss of all the glasses under investigation. The variation of dielectric parameters (ε′ and tanδ) at room temperature with different concentrations of chromium ions at 10 kHz is shown in Fig. 9  . The observations on the variation of tanδ with temperature for different concentrations of dopant indicate the gradual increase in the broadness and tanδmax  of relaxation curves. Among all the prepared samples C5 glass has a maximum value of dielectric loss with a shift of the relaxation region towards lower temperature. The summary of data on relaxation effects of Li2 O–PbO–B2 O3 –P2 O5 : Cr2 O3  glasses is mentioned in Table 4   along with the data, pertaining to activation energy for dipoles and breakdown strength [20] . Using the relation(4) f = f 0   exp − W d  / KT       the activation energy Wd  for dipoles is evaluated. Wd  is observed to be maximum (3.587 eV) for C0 sample and minimum (2.793 eV) for C5 glass. The a.c. conductivity σac  at different temperatures is calculated using the relation [20] (5) σ ac  = ω ε ′  ε o  tanδ .      Here εo  is the dielectric constant of vacuum. The variation of σac  with 1/T for pure and doped glasses at 100 kHz is shown in Fig. 10  . Using these plots, the activation energy for conduction, in the high temperature region over which a near linear dependence of log σac  with 1/T could be observed, is evaluated and furnished in Table 5  . The activation energy for conduction is found to be the lowest (0.121 eV) for C5 glass and the maximum value of activation energy for conduction is 0.166 eV for C0 glass. The inset (a) shows the variation of activation energy for conduction for different concentrations of chromium ions at 100 kHz. From this figure it is seen that the activation energy for conduction decreases with increase in chromium ion concentration. Inset (b) indicates the variation of σac  with the concentration of dopant at 100 kHz. Fig. 11   shows the plot of σac  versus 1/T at different frequencies for C3 glass. From the graphs it is concluded that σac  increases with increase in frequency. The inset shows the variation of σac  with activation energy for conduction at 473 K. A near linearity is found between σac  and activation energy for conduction. The measured value of dielectric breakdown strength of C0 glass at room temperature is 15.42 kV/cm. The value is observed to decrease with increase in the concentration of chromium ions and reaches the minimum value of 13.95 kV/cm for C5 glass. These values are presented in Table 5 .   4 Discussion 4.1 Physical parameters Normally density of solids is a wonderful tool for analyzing the structural changes. Density is influenced by structural compactness, variation in geometrical configuration, cross link density, coordination number and dimensions of interstitial vacancies of the glass system [21] . The increase in density due to doping of Cr2 O3  is proposed due to the replacement of lighter cation P5 +  by heavier Cr3 +  ion showing that the density of a sample is very much sensitive to the atomic weight and ionic size [22] . The maximum value of density and minimum molar volume of C5 glass reveal the compact nature of the specimen. When the basic glass is doped with Cr2 O3 , the chromium ions occupy the interstices of the glass network by creating B–O–Cr and Pb–O–Cr linkages, in sequence with conversion of BO4  tetrahedral to BO3  triangular structural units. The ionic radii of B3 +  in BO4  units (0.25 Å) are higher than B3 +  in BO3  units (0.15 Å) [23,24] .  4.2 Optical absorption Optical absorption spectra of the glass samples exhibit two prominent absorption peaks at 438 and 625 nm. These two bands have been identified due to transitions of Cr3 +  (d3 ) ions; using Tanabe–Sugano diagrams the spectrum has been analyzed and the bands are attributed to 4 A2  (F) → 4 T1  (F), 4 A2  (F) → 4 T2  (F) transitions respectively. Interestingly, two weak, narrow bands at 644 and 691 nm due to spin and parity forbidden transitions 4 A2  (F) → 2 T1  (G) and 4 A2  (F) → 2 Eg  (G) respectively have been located on 4 T2  band in the spectra of as prepared glasses. These bands appear due to spin orbit interaction and mixing between 2 E and 4 T and 2 T1  and 4 T2  levels [25] . The increase in widths of 2 T1  and 2 E bands has been noticed with increase in the concentration of chromium ions. This increase in width indicates an increasing degree of disorder in the glass system, may be due to the increasing concentration of induced heterogeneous nucleation centers in the glass samples. This result can also be explained as follows: as the concentration of Cr3 +  ions increases in the glass network, there is a possibility for the coupling of Cr3 +  ions with the Cr6 +  ions. This type of coupling makes the transitions spin allowed and responsible for increase in the intensity of these bands [26] . A new band is identified at 351 nm due to Cr6 +  ions [27] . The Cr6 +  ions exist in the form of Cr6 + O2 −  centers in the frame of CrO4 2 −  groups [28] . Cr6 +  ion belongs to d0  closed shell and does not have electrons in d shell. The Cr5 +  ions are expected to show absorption band around 465 nm [29] ; but such band is not observed in the spectra of the present glasses. Therefore concentration of Cr5 +  ions in the present glass matrices seems to be insignificant. The increase in the intensity of 4 T1  and 4 T2  absorption bands and a simultaneous minute increase in the intensity of the band at 351 nm in the spectra of all the glasses from C1 to C5 indicate an increase in the concentration of Cr3 +  ions with the Cr6 +  ions in the present investigation. The increase in the area of the curves due to the bands at 439 and 628 nm is much greater than the increase in area of the curve due to the band at 351 nm. This clearly indicates large increase in the concentration of Cr3 +  ions than the Cr6 +  ions. The Cr6 +  ions participate in the glass network with CrO4 2 −  structural units and alternate with BO4  units, leading to a decrease in the disorder of the glass network [27] . In the present study effect of Cr3 +  ions is dominating Cr6 +  ions. The higher the concentration of Cr3 +  ions simultaneously the higher is the concentration of non-bridging oxygens (NBO) in the glass matrix. The presence of higher concentration of these donor centers decreases the optical band gap and shifts the absorption edge towards higher wavelength side as observed for the glasses C1 to C5. The observed maximum Urbach energy for C5 glass (0.6015 eV) indicates the maximum width of the tails among investigated samples. The increase in Urbach energy (∆E) with increase in the concentration of Cr2 O3  is expected due to formation of defects like fluctuations in bond angle distortions and dangling bonds [30] . The additional factor contributing to the edge broadening is a static disorder which increases the density of localized states N(EF ) of these defects. The optical basicity (Λth ) of a chemically complex glass is the mean polarization condition of the ligands (O− 2 ) and their mean ability to transfer fractional charges to central cation [31] . Increase in Λth  reveals the increase of localized donor pressure on cations of glass matrix which in turn increases the ionic nature of the glass. Duffy and Ingram [31]  proved that the polarizability of oxygen ions is directly proportional to the optical basicity. The hike in the polarizability of oxygen ions is the evidence for the raise in the concentration of NBOs [32,33] . This is supported by the observed increase in ∆E and decrease in Eg  values.  4.3 ESR spectra The magnetic properties of Li2 O–PbO–B2 O3 –P2 O5 : Cr2 O3  glasses are due to Cr3 +  (3d3 ) paramagnetic ions. As per Hund's rule the ground state of chromium ions is 4 F which is associated with 3d3  electronic configurations. In an octahedral crystal field, this state splits into an orbital singlet 4 A2g  and two more orbital triplets 4 T1g  and 4 T2g [34] . In a distorted octahedral site, the electronic levels can be described by a spin-Hamiltonian [35] .(6) H = gβBS + D  S z  2  – S S + 1   / 3     + E  S x  2  − S y  2        Here the first term represents the electronic Zeeman term; second term represents the zero-field splitting of the quartet ground state. In the absence of an external magnetic field B; the four fold spin degeneracy of the 4 A2g  state is removed by a subsequent low symmetric field resulting in a zero field splitting of the Kramer's doublets |± 3/2> and |± 1/2> even at zero field. In the presence of magnetic field, the degenerate doublets split further and more transitions are possible. However, the number of resonance signals observed due to transitions depends upon the magnitude of the zero field splitting for a given photon energy [36] . The ESR spectra of the glasses exhibit two intense resonance signals at g = 1.986 and 5.23 due to Cr3 +  ions [37,38] . According to Landry, the low field line at g = 5.23 is attributed to the isolated Cr3 +  ions that have local rhombic sites subjected to strong crystal field effects [39,40] . This signal arises mainly due to − 3/2 ↔ + 3/2 that are allowed due to low symmetry of Cr3 +  ions. The larger intensity of this low field peak exhibited by the spectrum of all glasses indicates higher concentrations of isolated Cr3 +  ions in the samples. The resonance signal in the high field region with g = 1.986 arises due to exchange coupled Cr3 + –Cr3 +  pairs [41] . The intensity and line width of this signal are found to increase with increase in concentration of nucleating agent. This indicates the large increase in the concentration of Cr3 +  ions in the present glasses. The higher concentration of Cr3 +  ions which act as glass modifiers enhances the concentration of NBOs in the glass matrix. These donor centers reduce the optical band gap of the glasses as discussed in optical absorption studies. If there is a large separation between two Kramer's doublets then a resonance signal at g = 2.6 is observed. As there is no large separation between two Kramer's doublets so the resonance signal at g = 2.6 is not observed [42] .  4.4 FTIR spectra The structural changes in Li2 O–PbO–B2 O3 –P2 O5 : Cr2 O3  glasses are investigated by analyzing the FTIR spectra in the wavenumber range 400–1250 cm− 1 . When Li2 O is incorporated in B2 O3  it leads to conversion of sp2  planar BO3  units into more stable sp3  tetrahedral BO4  units [43,44] . Long tetrahedral chains of BO4  are formed when each BO4  unit is bonded with two other similar units. However, when PbO is added to the glass system tetrahedral BO4  units are converted into triangular BO3  units, by forming PbOn  polyhedron when it is surrounded by BO4  tetrahedrons. This structure behaves like a defect in the glass network [45] . When the pure glass is doped with Cr2 O3 , it will twist or distort the interconnected chains of BO4  units and enhance the randomness of glass network. With the increasing concentration of Cr2 O3  the intensity of vibration band corresponding to BO3  units, P O P asymmetric vibrations and B O B bending vibrations increases [46–49] . This clearly suggests the escalating modifying action of Cr3 +  ions with the increasing content of Cr2 O3.  The significant decrease in the intensity of the bands due to PO2 −  symmetrical stretching, BO4  units and P O P symmetric vibrations with increase in the concentration of nucleating agent indicates the decline in the Cr6 +  ions which act as glass formers. The intensity of the band due to ν4  vibrations of Cr2 O3  with CrO6  octahedral units increases where as the intensity of the band due to CrO4 − 2  tetrahedral units follows the reverse trend. These features confirm the raise of CrO6  octahedral units at the expense of CrO4 − 2  tetrahedral units [16,44,50] . The increase in modifying action of Cr2 O3  may rupture the BO4 , P O P, P O and PbO4  bonds with the creation of NBOs and creates a structural disorder in the glasses. In compliance with the structural changes inferred from FTIR studies, the observed decrease in band gap, increase in Urbach energy and increase in ESR signal intensity induced by doping of Cr2 O3  in the glass network might be explained by the increase of BO3  and CrO6  structural units along with the increase of NBOs (with increase of B O−  bonds).  4.5 Dielectric properties The influence of temperature on dielectric properties of glasses is a complicated phenomenon. The electronic, ionic, dipolar and space charge polarizations are the main sources of dielectric constant in glasses. Among these, the space charge polarization depends on the purity and the perfection of the glasses. In the present discussion on dielectric properties of Li2 O–PbO–B2 O3 –P2 O5  glasses, with the increase in the concentration of Cr2 O3  the values of ε′, tanδ and σac  are found to increase at any frequency and temperature. The values of breakdown strength and activation energy for ac conduction are found to decrease with increase in content of dopant. This result is expected due to the gradual conversion of Cr6 +  ions (network formers) into Cr3 +  ions which act as modifiers (proved from ESR and optical absorption spectra). These ions depolymerize the glass matrix and create bonding defects by breaking B O B, B O Pb etc. bonds. These defects create easy pathways for the migration of charges that would build up space charge polarization and cause the increase in the dielectric parameters [51–54] . The ascending values of tanδmax  and narrowing of relaxation peaks with increase in chromium ions indicate an increase of freedom for dipoles to orient in the field direction, obviously due to decrease in the rigidity of the glass matrix. In general, the dielectric relaxation effects are observed only when the metal ions present in the glass system are in divalent state as discussed earlier [50,55] . The divalent ions of lead together with a pair of any cationic vacancies may form dipoles and such dipoles are responsible for the observed dielectric relaxation effects. Indirectly, it leads to the conclusion that there is a decrease in rigidity of the glass network at higher concentrations of Cr2 O3 . In the present discussion of the glass samples, in the high temperature region the conduction phenomenon can be explained on the basis of defect model suggested by Ingram [56] . When a plot is drawn between logσ(ω) and activation energy for conduction a near linear relationship is observed (inset of Fig. 11 ). An approximate linearity between the conductivity and the activation energy reveals the fact that conductivity enhancement is directly proportional to the increasing mobility of the charge carriers in the high temperature region. Since the Pb2 +  ions are less mobile than the alkali ions: Pb2 +  ions can be regarded as virtually immobile within the time window of hopping processes of Li+  ions [57] . Therefore in the high temperature region, the monovalent lithium ions contribute to the conduction in the present samples. Hence, the conductivity is found to increase with increase in the concentration of Cr2 O3  due to increase in the modifying action of Cr3 +  ions. The highest conductivity and the lowest activation energy obtained for C5 glass are obviously due to the highest concentration of the Cr3 +  ions; which may find easy paths for migration in the disordered glass network. The proportionate higher concentration of Cr6 +  ions takes network forming positions which restrict the mobility of Li+  ions and hence the conductivity is found to decrease for lower concentration of Cr2 O3  in the glasses. Among different types of conduction mechanisms in the glasses (such as band conduction, conduction in extended states, conduction in localized states near the band edge and conduction in localized states near the Fermi level), the conduction in the localized states near the Fermi level takes place when ac conductivity is nearly temperature independent and varies linearly with frequency. The conduction in the present Li2 O–PbO–B2 O3 –P2 O5 : Cr2 O3  glasses in the low temperature region (up to nearly 340 K) can safely be attributed to take place by this mechanism. The value of density of energy states N(EF ) near Fermi level, for 100 kHz frequency and at 303 K, is evaluated on the basis of quantum mechanical tunneling model [58,59]  as per the procedure given in the papers [51,60,61]  and is furnished in Table 5 . The value of N(EF ) is found to increase with increase in concentration of chromium ions, indicates an increase in the disorder of the glass system and is supported by the increase of Urbach energy ΔE values at higher concentrations of dopant in the glass matrix. The value of N(EF ) is found to be maximum for C5 glass. A gradual decrease in the dielectric breakdown strength (from that of the pure glass) of glasses has been observed when the concentration of Cr2 O3  is increased. When an electric field is applied to the dielectric, the heat of dielectric loss is liberated. If the applied electric field (E) is an alternating field, the specific dielectric loss, i.e. the loss per unit volume of the dielectric is given by the following equation [62] (7) ρ 1  W / m 3    = E 2  ω ε ′  ε o  tanδ     where E is the strength of applied electric field. This equation indicates that the higher the values of ε′tanδ of the glass at a given frequency, the higher are the values of ρ1 . When a voltage is applied across a dielectric, heat is liberated, then the temperature of the dielectric increases and loss increases furthermore. The dielectric breakdown strength is, in fact, inversely proportional to the specific dielectric loss given by Eq. (7) . The observations on dielectric breakdown strength of Li2 O–PbO–B2 O3 –P2 O5 : Cr2 O3  glasses, as mentioned earlier, indicate the rate of increase of ε′tanδ with temperature as the highest for C5 glass. The heat liberated during the breakdown achieved by the application of voltage across the dielectric raises the ε′tanδ value. The dielectric breakdown strength is inversely proportional to ε′tanδ [62] . Thus the dielectric breakdown strength is lowest for the glass C5 when compared to the other glasses (Table 5 ). Hence, the results on dielectric breakdown strength of Li2 O–PbO–B2 O3 –P2 O5 : Cr2 O3  glasses revealed that there is a maximum internal disorder in the C5 glass.   5 Conclusions The summary of conclusions drawn from the study of various properties of Li2 O–PbO–B2 O3 –P2 O5 : Cr2 O3  glasses is mentioned below:i) Glasses with composition 20Li2 O–20PbO–45B2 O3 –(15 − x) P2 O5 : xCr2 O3  (x ranging from 0 to 1 mol%) were synthesized with conventional melt quenching and heat treatment.  ii) The absence of Bragg peaks in the XRD spectra of the prepared samples revealed the amorphous nature of the glasses.  iii) The increase in intensity of optical absorption bands of 438 and 625 nm is attributed to the increase in concentration of Cr3 +  ions occupying the octahedral positions in the glass network.  iv) The decrease in optical band gap and the gradual increase in Urbach energy with the increasing content of dopant is due to the increase of Cr3 +  ions and the increase in density of localized state.  v) The observed hike in optical basicity of the glasses with the increasing content of Cr2 O3  showed the increase in ionic nature of the glasses.  vi) The ESR spectral analysis indicated that chromium ions are predominantly in the Cr3 +  state and occupy octahedral positions with increase in the dopant concentration. The concentration of such ions is found to be the maximum in C5 glass.  vii) IR spectra showed the increase in intensity of the bands due to BO3 , B O B, P O P asymmetrical and ν4 -Cr2 O3  structural units with increase in the content of nucleating agent Cr2 O3 . This result indicated the increase of NBOs reducing the rigidity of the glass matrix.  viii) The dielectric parameters viz. ε′, tanδ and σac  are observed to increase whereas the dielectric breakdown strength and the activation energy for ac conduction are found to decrease from C0 to C5 glasses indicating an increase in the depolymerisation of the glass system due to the presence of increasing concentration of Cr3 +  ions that act as modifiers.

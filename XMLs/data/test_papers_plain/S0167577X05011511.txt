                  Crosslinkable fluorinated poly(aryl ether ether ketone)s (3F-PEEKn-PEP) bearing phenylethynyl moieties were synthesized via the polymerization of (3-trifluoromethyl) phenyl hydroquinone with an excess 4,4′-difluorobenzophenone, followed by the reaction of 4-phenylethynyl phenol. They could be processed during their precursor forms by solution casting method. The cured polymers showed higher glass transition temperatures, good chemical resistance, and high thermal stability after thermal treatment at 360 °C for 2 h. The cured films had no obvious absorptions at the wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55 μm.

Keywords Fluoropolymers  Optical materials and properties  Dielectrics  Crosslinking behavior    1 Introduction Aromatic poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK™) (Scheme 1  ) is a kind of high-temperature engineering thermoplastics known for its excellent combination of chemical, physical and mechanical properties [1,2] . There has been a continuous demand for high-temperature materials for use in microelectronic and optical devices, such as insulating materials as interlayer dielectrics and intermetal dielectrics, coatings as electronic packaging, and low loss waveguide materials. The fluorinated polymers with high performance have been explored for applications in microelectronic devices, optical wave-guide materials, and gas-separation membranes for their unique properties [3] . A great deal of effort has been concentrated on the preparation of oligomers and polymers containing crosslinkable moieties. These materials showed an attractive combination of properties, such as processing advantages, high strength and toughness, excellent thermal properties, solvent resistance, and dimension stability. Therefore, these high performance and high temperature materials have been developed for the applications as electronic, optical and aerospace materials [4,5] . Recently, we have reported a kind of fluorinated poly(ether ether ketone) (3F-PEEK) (Scheme 1 ) with good solubility, excellent thermal stability, good mechanical properties, low moisture absorption, and low dielectric constant. It may be a promising high performance material for optical and electric applications [6,7] . Good solubility is of great advantage for making thin film and coating. However, good solubility shows limit in the proceeding of multi-layer coating operation and brings some problems to the devices including sharp-cleaving property and chemical nonresistance. In this work, a thermally crosslinkable phenylethynyl group was introduced into the end of 3F-PEEK backbone. The crosslinking behavior and properties including thermal property, solubility, and optical properties were discussed.  2 Experimental 2.1 Materials (3-Trifluoromethyl)phenylhydroquinone (3F-PH)(99%) [6]  and 4-phenylethynyl phenol (PEP) (99%) [5]  were synthesized in our laboratory. 4,4′-Difluorobenzophenone was obtained from Yanji Chemical Plant (China) and distilled under vacuum before use. All of the other reagents were obtained commercially and used as received.  2.2 Measurements Mass spectra and purities spectra were obtained on a Finnigan 4510 mass spectrometer. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on a Mettler Toledo DSC821e  instrument at the heating rate of 20 °C/min under nitrogen. Glass transition temperature (T g ) was taken from the DSC curve as the center of the step transition. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Perkin Elmer TGA-7 thermal analyzer system at the heating rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen. The FTIR spectra (KBr or film) were measured using a Nicolet Impact 410 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Gel permeation chromatograms (GPC) were obtained by a Waters 410 instrument with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. The 1 H (500 MHz) and 13 C (125.7 MHz) spectra were recorded using a Bruker 510 NMR spectrometer with tetramethylsilane as the reference. Near-infrared spectra (Near-IR) were performed on a Varian Kera 500 spectrometer.  2.3 Synthesis of activated fluorine terminated 3F-PEEKn oligomers A typical polymerization procedure was as follows (Scheme 2  ): (3-Trifluoromethyl)phenylhydroquinone (7.62 g, 0.03 mol), 4,4′-difluorobenzophenone (7.848 g, 0.036 mol), K2 CO3  (4.347 g, 0.0315 mol), DMAc (62 ml) and toluene (35 ml) were put in a reaction flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet, magnetic stirrer, and Dean–Stark trap and a condenser. The reaction mixture was allowed to reflux for 2 h. The toluene was removed by distillation. The system was heated to 160 °C. The polymerization was allowed to react at 160 °C for 6 h. The mixture was poured into 1000 ml acidic water. The precipitated polymer was filtered and washed with methanol and deionized water. The pale yellow solid (3F-PEEK10 ) was obtained and dried under vacuum (80 °C) for 24 h. GPC: Number-average molecular weight (M n ), 6547. Polysispersity (M w  / M n ), 1.48. 1  H NMR (CDCl3 , δ , ppm): 7.84 (d , 2 H), 7.18 (s , 1 H), 7.20 (d , 1 H), 7.72 (d , 2 H), 7.65 (d , 2 H), 7.54 (d , 1 H), 7.49 (t , 1 H), 7.26–7.18 (m , 3 H), 7.11–6.89 (m , 4 H).  2.4 Synthesis of crosslinkable 3F-PEEKn-PEP A typical reaction procedure was as follows: The reaction equipment was the similar to of 3F-PEEK. 3F-PEEK (7 g), PEP (1.358 g), DMAc (30 ml), K2 CO3  (0.5 g) and benzene (25 ml) were added to the flask. The reaction mixture was allowed to reflux for 1.5 h. The benzene was removed by distillation. The system was heated to 120 °C and reacted for 6 h. The reaction mixture was poured into 200 ml acidic water. The precipitated polymer was filtered and washed with methanol and deionized water. The pale yellow solid, 3F-PEEK10 -PEP, was dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h. GPC: Number-average molecular weight (M n ), 7661. Polysispersity (M w  / M n ), 1.22. 13 C-NMR (CDCl3 , δ , ppm): 88.6, 89.4 (ethynyl), 117.7, 119.7, 123.1, 128.3, 131.6, 133.4, 155.8(PEP).  2.5 Preparation of crosslinked 3F-PEEKn-PEP films 3F-PEEKn-PEP in precursor form was dissolved into cyclohexanone at concentration of 30 wt.%. Then the solution was filtered with a syringe through a 0.2-mm Teflon membrane filter. The filtered solution was coated on microscope slides, gradually increased temperature to volatilize solvent, and then cured at 360 °C for 2 h under a vacuum. The transparent and flexible films in cured forms were obtained.   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization of polymers Lee et al. [5]  have reported a method to introduce phenylethynyl group into poly(arylene ethers) to yield crosslinking polymers with some outstanding properties. The curing of the polymers proceeds in the absence of a catalyst, without evolution of any volatile. We introduced a phenylethynyl group as a crosslinkable moiety into a fluorinated poly(ether ether ketone) in a two-step aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction. In the first step, the oligomers terminated with activated fluorines were obtained by the polymerization of a bisphenol monomer with an excess bisfluoro monomer in the presence of potassium carbonate as a base in DMAc. The crosslinkable PEEKs were obtained by the further reactions of the oligomers (various molecular weights) with 4-phenylethynyl phenol, as shown in Scheme 2 . The results of synthesis are summarized in Table 1  . The number n  in the polymer codes is the degree of polymerization calculated for monomer imbalance. The molecular weights were controlled by the monomers feed ratio. The number-average molecular weights determined by GPC correspond well with the theoretically calculated molecular weights. The number-average molecular weights (M n ) and polydispersities (M w  / M n ) of the resulting polymers of 3F-PEEKn-PEP were in the range of 7661–17397 and 1.22–1.32, respectively. The structures of the resulting oligomers or polymers were characterized using NMR spectra, and all the results were well agreed with their structures.  3.2 Crosslinking behaviors and thermal properties DSC analysis was performed to study the thermal crosslinking behaviors of the polymers. Intense exotherms due to the reaction of the phenylethynyl moieties were started at around 350 °C (Fig. 1  ). After curing the polymer at 360 °C for 2 h, no further exotherms were observed when the samples were rerun up to the 450 °C (Fig. 2  ). As shown in Table 2  , T g 's and maximum data of exotherms increased with increasing the molecular weight of oligomers before curing. However, the cured polymers with low molecular weights showed higher T g  values. 3F-PEEK10 -PEP had highest T g  value of 164 °C, which was due to its high crosslinking density. Both of T g 's after and before curing depended on the feed radios of the monomers, and their relationships were shown in Fig. 3  . The cured 3F-PEEK-PEP polymers exhibited high thermal stability (Table 2 ). The temperatures at a 5% weight loss (TD5 ) are above 463 °C and the temperatures at a 10% weight loss (TD10 ) are above 494 °C under a N2  atmosphere. The high thermal stability is attributed to the aromatic structures and strong C–F bonds.  3.3 Solubility of polymers; 3.3.1 DMAc:; NMP:; It is well known that the conventional PEEK could not be dissolved in most known organic solvents. In sharp contrast, the precursor forms, 3F-PEEKn oligomers, were soluble at room temperature in aprotic polar solvents such as N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), N,N -dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and N,N -dimethylformamide (DMF) as well as in the less polar solvents such as chloroform and tetrahydrofuran (THF). This was attributed to their molecular structures with a bulky pendant group. Therefore, they could be readily processed by the solution casting method. The cured samples showed good solvent resistance property after treatment at 360 °C for 2 h under N2  atmosphere. They could not dissolve in the above mentioned solvents, and show good short-term swelling resistance.   3.4 Optical properties Near-IR spectra were used to study the light absorptions of the crosslinked films in the optical communication region, as shown in Fig. 4  . There was an absorption peak due to the third harmonic of the stretching vibration of the C–H bond(3ν Φ  CH, 1.13 μm), a peak due to the combination of the second harmonic of the stretching vibration and deformation vibration of the C–H bond (2ν Φ  CH + δ Φ  CH, 1.4 μm), and a peak due to the second harmonic of the stretching vibration of the C–H bond (2ν Φ  CH, 1.66 μm) [8,9] . However, they had small light absorption at the telecommunication wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55 μm.   4 Conclusion A series of cross-linkable fluorinated poly(aryl ether ether ketone) oligomers have been successfully synthesized in a two-step synthetic route. The flexible films could be prepared by solution casting of the precursors, and then curing at 360 °C. The cross-linked polymer offered highly thermal stability, higher glass transition temperature, and good solvent resistance. They showed small optical absorptions at 1.3 and 1.55 μm.

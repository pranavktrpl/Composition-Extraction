                  Laser crystallization of a-Si:H on PES, PET and AryLite™ polymer substrates is reported. For each material, the glass transition temperature T
                     g and the coefficient of thermal expansion have been evaluated, to determine the optimum deposition and crystallization processes conditions. 1000-Å thick intrinsic amorphous silicon films have been deposited on the substrates by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition in the temperature range of 120–250°C. Dehydrogenation and crystallization have been obtained by high energy (10 J) XeCl pulsed excimer laser. The irradiation conditions have been varied to study their influence on the electrical and optical properties of crystallized material. Structural characterization has been performed by X-ray Diffraction. Increasing the radiation energy densities up to 220 mJ/cm2 crystallites sizes up to 750 Å have been obtained.

For each material, the glass transition temperature T g  and the coefficient of thermal expansion have been evaluated, to determine the optimum deposition and crystallization processes conditions. 1000-Å thick intrinsic amorphous silicon films have been deposited on the substrates by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition in the temperature range of 120–250°C. Dehydrogenation and crystallization have been obtained by high energy (10 J) XeCl pulsed excimer laser. The irradiation conditions have been varied to study their influence on the electrical and optical properties of crystallized material. Structural characterization has been performed by X-ray Diffraction. Increasing the radiation energy densities up to 220 mJ/cm2  crystallites sizes up to 750 Å have been obtained.   Keywords Laser irradiation  Hydrogenated amorphous silicon  Polymers  X-ray diffraction    1 Introduction Weight reduction and mechanical robustness are the main advantages expected from the replacement of glass polymer substrates. Silicon thin film technologies on polymer substrates will benefit the rapidly growing market of portable, lightweight and cheap electronic applications (multimedia telephones, hand-held computers, etc.). The low glass transition temperature is the major disadvantage in using polymers instead of the conventional glass substrates. In the last years, efforts are made to reduce the maximum processing temperature for the device fabrication [1] . Nowadays, high performance polymers are commercially available, featuring maximum processing temperatures in the range of 200–250 °C and even higher for some special polymer like Kapton®. The development of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) technology allows deposition of films at temperatures consistent with polymer substrates [1–3] . These films are crystallized by means of pulsed laser irradiation to obtain high mobility polycrystalline silicon. To prevent the substrate thermal degradation, an inorganic coating has to be deposited between it and the semiconductor layer. Without this, contamination and peeling-off of the film during the rapid melting event have been observed [4] . Three different materials have been investigated: Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Polyethersulphone (PES) and AryLite™ (from Ferrania). For each polymer, the glass transition temperature T g  and the coefficient of thermal expansion CTE have been determined in order to identify the best deposition and crystallization conditions. This work describes a process that is compatible with some polymer substrates, determining the optimised excimer laser crystallization process parameters.  2 Experimental As first step, we determined the highest processing temperature related to the substrate under investigation: PES, PET and AryLite™. Therefore, for each polymer, the glass transition temperature T g  and the coefficient of thermal expansion CTE have been evaluated by DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry), DMA (Differential Mechanical Analysis) and TMA (Thermo Mechanical Analysis) measurements. An 800-nm-thick SiO2  layer has been deposited by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) on each substrate as thermal barrier and to provide a smooth surface for the subsequent deposition. Gas pressure and RF power density are kept constant at 600 mTorr and 35 mW/cm2 , respectively. A 100-nm-thick hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) film has been deposited by PECVD on the SiO2  layer at 750 mTorr and 21 mW/cm2  using pure SiH4 . The process temperature, for both SiO2  and a-Si:H, was varied according to the glass transition temperature and the thermal expansion coefficient of the substrate. The crystallization process has been performed by a high energy excimer laser (XeCl at 308 nm) “Hercules-L”, a prototype laser completely designed by ENEA, with a maximum energy output of 10 J, a pulse width of 120 ns and a maximum repetition rate of 10 Hz. The beam spot size is 100 mm×70 mm. The samples, irradiated in air at room temperature, have been placed on a computer controlled X-table, with a position accuracy of 1 μm, to obtain a uniform irradiation along the whole surface. Before impinging on the sample, the laser beam passes through homogenization optics to obtain a flat-top beam profile of 100 mm×13 mm. The homogenization system allows for a continuous energy density control in the range between 120 and 1200 mJ/cm2 . This fine control ensures the required flexibility for the a-Si crystallization without damage of the polymer substrates. Before crystallization, a preliminary dehydrogenation step is indispensable to prevent severe damage of the a-Si:H films, due to the irradiation process and the high hydrogen content: it is usually done at high temperature (about 400°C) in a forming gas, while, in this case it has been performed using laser irradiation at energy densities in the 120–160 mJ/cm2  range. The pulse energy density used for film crystallization has been varied between 160 and 220 mJ/cm2 . Optical reflection measurements of the amorphous and crystallized samples have been done using a Perkin-Elmer λ-900 UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer in the 200–500 nm wavelength range. The crystalline structure has been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements carried out with an X'PERT-MPD (Philips) diffractometer using a Cu Kα  radiation source. The analysis is performed in the range of 2Θ  values from 20° to 60°. XRD measurements in thin film configuration, with a grazing angle of 0.7°, have been done to enhance the film's signal with respect to the substrate signal. The crystallites sizes have been calculated by Debey–Sherrer formula from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) intensity of the peaks from XRD spectra obtained in Bragg–Brentano configuration. Electrical characterizations have been performed with coplanar silver print contacts on the crystallized thin films using a HP4140 pA meter/DC voltage source, to evaluate the film resistivity. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements using a Digital Instruments Nanoscope IV have been done in order to evaluate film roughness. On some films on PET substrates–alternatively crystallized using a Nd:YLF laser at 532 nm instead of the excimer laser, but with comparable energy densities–Raman measurements and Time Resolved Microwave Conductivity (TRMC) measurements [7]  have been performed in order to get additional information about the film structure and charge carriers mobility. TRMC measurements have been done using a Nd:YAG laser with 10-ns pulses at 532 nm for excitation and a microwave setup operating in a Ká-band (28.5–40 GHz) system, as described elsewhere [7] . The TRMC signal is proportional to the product of the respective charge carrier mobility and number of free charge carriers and therefore related to the drift mobility of the material. It should, however, be noted that the influence of grain boundaries on the signal is different than in the case of a real drift experiment, where the charge carriers have eventually to cross the grain boundaries. In [8] , a more detailed discussion can be found.  3 Results and discussion 3.1 Substrate thermo-mechanical properties The DSC thermal analysis technique measures heat flows and phase changes on a sample under thermal cycles. A constant thermal rate of 10 °C/min in N2  flow was used. The temperatures associated with endothermic transitions measured by DSC analysis technique on the amorphous thermoplastic polymers PES and AryLite™ give clear evidence of their glass transition temperature. Fig. 1   shows the DSC thermogram of PES film, as an example. The behaviour is very straightforward and typical of a homogeneous amorphous polymer, exhibiting a single glass transition at 226.7 °C. The DSC experiments carried out on PET, a semi-crystalline polymer, do not give clear indication of the T g  of material. The presence of a well-developed crystalline phase hinders the molecular mobility of macromolecules in the amorphous phase, resulting in a loss of sensibility of calorimetric technique for the measurement of glass transition. On the contrary, this phase transition is clearly evidenced by DMA measurements, as shown in Fig. 2  . The maximum in the flex loss modulus corresponds to substrate T g  (98 °C). TMA measurements give dimensional changes in length, width and thickness and allow determining the Thermal Expansion Coefficient (CTE) of the materials as a function of the temperature under a controlled atmosphere. In Fig. 3  , the TMA analysis results for PET are shown. During thermal cycles, PET substrates show a good mechanical and dimensional stability also at process temperatures higher than T g . Therefore, performing a previous thermal cycle, the process temperature for the PET substrate may exceed the glass transition temperature. Table 1   summarizes the results from DSC, DMA and TMA analyses.  3.2 Crystallized silicon The optimum deposition temperature has been determined by the thermo-mechanical analysis of the substrates, while pressure and power density values have been chosen as standard values for high quality amorphous silicon [9] . In particular, the deposition temperature, both for SiO2  and a-Si:H, is: for PET 120 °C, for PES 150 °C and for AryLite™ 220 °C. The dehydrogenation procedure performed on the samples has been the same for each substrate: multiple irradiation shots (up to 100) at an energy density value sufficiently low to avoid the beginning of the crystallization process. Without the dehydrogenation step, film peeling during crystallization has been observed. During the subsequent crystallization, only one single shot per energy density has been applied. 3.2.1 PET For the films on PET substrates, the dehydrogenation energy density is in the range between 120 and 140 mJ/cm2 . The minimum energy density value for uniform crystallization has been found to be 160 mJ/cm2 . It is possible to crystallize films at higher energies but it has to be done through a step by step process with energy densities increasing at most 10 mJ/cm2  each step, starting from the minimum value; otherwise, using directly higher energy densities, the films are damaged, which happens for energy density values higher than 180 mJ/cm2 . This is probably due to the low deposition temperature (120 °C) that causes internal stress in the film. In Fig. 4  , reflectance spectra of amorphous and crystallized thin films on PET are shown: the prominent maxima at 273 nm and 365 nm are due to direct optical transition [5,6]  typical of a crystalline silicon phase. The reflectance spectrum of the amorphous film does not present these peaks. The prominence of these maxima is more evident increasing laser energy density. XRD analysis, Fig. 5  , confirms the crystallization process by excimer laser and gives better evidence of the influence for irradiation energy densities. Crystallites size increases with increasing energy density ranging from 50 to 100 Å. As described above, some samples have been crystallized by an Nd:YLF laser with energy densities between 160 and 210 mJ/cm2 . As an example, in Fig. 6   the Raman spectra of the sample obtained by laser irradiation with 200 mJ/cm2  are shown and compared to the spectrum measured on the same sample before crystallization. Width and position of the sharp characteristic peak around 511 nm confirm clearly the crystallization. The mobility values as a function of the crystallization energy density are shown in Table 2  . Rather small mobilities have been determined by the contactless TRMC measurements and the decay behaviour suggests a very high charge carrier trapping rate. It should be mentioned that on these samples small values of the crystallites size have been measured and no hydrogen passivation of grain boundaries has been applied.  3.2.2 PES, AryLite™ For the films on PES and AryLite™, dehydrogenation has been conducted in the range 120–150 mJ/cm2 . The minimum energy density for uniform crystallization is 190 mJ/cm2 , while the maximum energy density, before damaging the films, is 220 mJ/cm2 . In this case, it is adequate to utilize a double-step process: a first pulse at minimum crystallization energy density (190 mJ/cm2  for both substrates) and a second pulse with higher energy density. Reflectance spectra are similar as spectra measured on PET substrates. XRD measurements on PES, shown in Fig. 7  , give a crystallites size that ranges from 180 to 750 Å, increasing with laser energy density. Similar results are obtained for XRD measurements on AryLite™ with crystallites size ranging from 130 to 150 up to 210 Å with the laser energy density of 190, 200, 220 mJ/cm2 . For films on PES substrate, the average crystallites sizes and electrical resistivity are reported in Fig. 8  , as a function of the laser energy density. The two points at 220 mJ/cm2  for the PES substrate are obtained with different crystallization procedure: the lower crystallites size (550 Å) is obtained with a single shot, while the other one (750 Å) is obtained with one shot at 210 and one at 220 mJ/cm2 : even though the step by step procedure is not necessary for the safeguard of the film, it seems to be necessary in order to increase the crystallites size. Fig. 9   shows the average surface roughness of the excimer laser annealed Si films on PES substrate as function of the laser energy density during crystallization. The average roughness values obtained from AFM images are in the range between 4 and 10 nm.    4 Conclusions Hydrogenated amorphous silicon films on polymer substrates have been irradiated in air by a pulsed XeCl excimer laser. A two-step crystallization procedure has been developed consisting in a first dehydrogenation step at energy density lower than the crystallization threshold and a subsequent irradiation for crystallization at energy density values around 200 mJ/cm2 . Homogeneous thin polycrystalline silicon films on large area have been obtained on substrates made of three different polymers, including low cost PET, with rather low glass transition temperature, and AryLite™, with higher T g , by using a SiO2  buffer layer. The films obtained on PET suffer from the low deposition temperature of amorphous silicon and the subsequent high hydrogen content, showing small crystallites size and resulting small carrier mobility after crystallization. With non-transparent PES and transparent AryLite™ substrates, the higher T g 's allow high deposition temperature and larger crystallites sizes.

                  A systematic study of the deposition parameters for the metal–organic chemical vapour deposition growth of In–Sb–Te (IST), of interest for phase change memory applications, was performed. Samples were grown on Si/SiO2 and patterned substrates in the (220÷350)°C temperature range and working pressure from 35 to 100×102
                     Pa, which resulted in the formation of thin films (down to 30nm) or IST crystals. The chemical composition of the IST films was mainly dependent on the deposition temperature. We have demonstrated the possibility to obtain a conformal and smooth morphology with improved surface roughness for films grown at 260°C when the substrate surface is treated with the TrisDimethylaMinoAntimony ([N(CH3)2]3Sb) precursor. The IST-based chalcogenide films exhibited different crystalline and partially amorphous phases, which may be favourable for multilevel data storage. The IST growth mechanism was analysed in terms of the structural, compositional and electrical properties.

A systematic study of the deposition parameters for the metal–organic chemical vapour deposition growth of In–Sb–Te (IST), of interest for phase change memory applications, was performed. Samples were grown on Si/SiO2  and patterned substrates in the (220 ÷ 350) °C temperature range and working pressure from 35 to 100 × 102  Pa, which resulted in the formation of thin films (down to 30 nm) or IST crystals. The chemical composition of the IST films was mainly dependent on the deposition temperature. We have demonstrated the possibility to obtain a conformal and smooth morphology with improved surface roughness for films grown at 260 °C when the substrate surface is treated with the TrisDimethylaMinoAntimony ([N(CH3 )2 ]3 Sb) precursor. The IST-based chalcogenide films exhibited different crystalline and partially amorphous phases, which may be favourable for multilevel data storage. The IST growth mechanism was analysed in terms of the structural, compositional and electrical properties.   Highlights ► Metal–organic chemical vapour deposition growth of In–Sb–Te phase change alloys. ► Analysis of morphological, structural and compositional properties. ► Effect of substrate pre-treatment by Sb metalorganic precursor on layer roughness. ► Thickness-dependence of resistivity as a function of the In–Sb–Te layer thickness.   Keywords In–Sb–Te  MOCVD  Chalcogenides  Non-volatile memories    1 Introduction Phase-change chalcogenide compounds, such as Ge2 Sb2 Te5  (GST), are promising materials for phase change memories (PCM) [1]  and have led to good device properties, such as speed, stability and data retention [2] . Mainly, GST films have been obtained by sputtering deposition [3] , chemical vapour deposition (CVD) [4,5]  and atomic layer deposition techniques [6] . Among them, metal–organic CVD (MOCVD) has the advantages of better step coverage/hole filling for deposition onto structured substrates, industrial transfer and higher composition control. Previously, we have reported the MOCVD growth of GST on SiO2 /Si substrates, with potential application for PCM devices [7] . Other emerging chalcogenide materials to be used in PCM devices are In–Sb–Te (IST) alloys [8–10] . They have a higher crystallization temperature (TC  > 290 °C) and a higher melting point (~ 626 °C) [8,11]  than GST, therefore they are a promising candidate for PCM devices for automotive applications, where data retention has to be granted for 10 years at high temperatures. Moreover, compared to GST materials, IST shows multi-level phase transformation phenomena from amorphous to crystalline IST ternary phase, through several intermediate phases, such as InSb, SbTe and InTe, which is favourable for multi-level data storage [12,13] . Mainly, the IST deposition is realized by industrial processes based on sputtering, which is not the technique of choice for conformal deposition inside high aspect-ratio structures [9,10,14] . Up-to now only one group has reported on the MOCVD of IST, however the IST deposition was achieved at a significantly lower reactor pressure (6.5 to 13 × 102  Pa) and a deposition rate from 0.32 to 0.14 nm/min [15] . In this work we studied the MOCVD deposition of In–Sb–Te. In addition, the electrical resistivity of these films was investigated in view of their implementation into non-volatile memory devices.  2 Experiments Electronic-grade solution TriMethylIndium In(CH3 )3  (TMIn), TrisDimethylaMinoAntimony [N(CH3 )2 ]3 Sb (TDMASb) and DiisoPropylTelluride (C3 H7 )3 Te (DiPTe) were used as In, Sb and Te metal-organic precursors, respectively. The bubbler temperature for all the precursors was kept constant at 20 °C during the depositions. The precursor vapours were transported to the reactor by the aid of N2  carrier/process gas with a total flow of 4 L/min. The reactor working pressure varied from 35 to 100 × 102  Pa and the deposition temperature from 220 to 350 °C. The depositions were performed on planar SiO2  and on patterned substrates, containing sub-micron trenches, formed by a combination of metals and dielectrics. The film thicknesses and the surface morphology were observed via cross-section images using the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Zeiss Supra 40 field-effect microscopy at 15 kV acceleration voltage. The crystallinity and structure of the IST films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments in grazing incidence configurations by means of an ItalStructures HRD3000 diffractometer, 40 kV, 30 mA, Cu Kα  radiation source. X-ray reflectivity (XRR) was performed with the same instrument to determine layer thickness, surface roughness and electron density. The chemical composition analysis was performed by total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF). X-ray fluorescence measurements were done using an ItalStructures XRR-TXRF 3000 system, 40 kV, 30 mA, Mo Kα  radiation source. The resistivity of the IST layers was determined by sheet resistance vs. temperature measurements, using the van der Pauw  4-probe method (from room temperature to 450 °C).  3 Results and discussion In order to cover the substrate with a uniform IST nanometric layer, different MOCVD deposition conditions were tested. In the case of IST thin film growth, the deposition temperature should be ideally maintained as low as possible, below the expected crystallization temperature TC   (~ 280 °C, [8] ), in order to obtain amorphous conformal layers. Actually, the growth of IST was even achieved at higher deposition temperatures (350 °C), inducing the formation of crystalline material. As shown in Fig. 1  , the surface morphology of the samples grown on planar SiO2  substrate depends on the deposition temperature. Samples grown in the 220 to 250 °C temperature range (Fig. 1 a–b) exhibited grainy morphology, due to unsatisfactory precursor dissociation, thus a low deposition rate. The conformality and the continuity of the deposited films improved when growing at 260 °C (Fig. 1 c). On the other hand, samples grown at 350 °C (Fig. 1 d) showed nanostructured morphology and non-continuous layers were grown: in this case the strong tendency to form crystal grains was evident. In the work of Ahn et al. [16]  a similar morphology effect was observed by varying the deposition temperature. Next, in order to improve the substrate coverage and conformality of the IST thin layers deposited at 260 °C, different pre-treatment strategies were investigated. Therefore, before the IST deposition, the substrates were exposed to TDMASb or TMIn + TDMASb vapours for 5 min. The precursor concentrations for both the surface pre-treatment and the IST deposition were kept constant and equal. The effect of the different surface pre-treatment for the samples deposited at 260 °C is shown in Fig. 2  . A comparison of XRR spectra obtained from IST layer deposited with and without TDMASb pre-treatment is shown in Fig. 3  , while the parameters extracted from the simulation of the XRR spectra of all the analysed samples are reported in Table 1  . As a general feature, in all cases the CVD character of the deposition induced good trench sidewall coverage, which is a fundamental aspect for the technological implementation of scaled PCM devices. In particular, it was found by the TDMASb pre-treatment that the roughness is dramatically lowered from ~ 4 nm (Fig. 2 a, no pre-treatment) to ~ 2 nm (Fig. 2 b, TDMASb pre-treatment), as confirmed by the smooth and uniform morphology. As a comparison, Ahn et al. reported a roughness of approximately 3.2 nm for the IST layers deposited by MOCVD at 250 °C [17] . Differently, when the combined pre-treatment of TMIn + TDMASb was used, compact grain morphology was observed, corresponding to a higher surface roughness (~ 4.8 nm) and poorer morphology (Fig. 2 c). Further, we achieved film thickness control from 100 to 30 nm, where for the IST and TDMASb pre-treated IST films the calculated electron density remained constant, while the surface roughness improved by 50% for the same layer thickness (see Table 1 ). The deposition rate of the best film morphology (Fig. 2 b), obtained with the TDMASb pre-treatment on patterned substrate, was approx. 0.40 nm/min, while on a planar SiO2  substrate it was approx. 0.58 nm/min; the different values can be accounted for when considering the different materials forming the substrates. Comparing with In–Sb–Te layers studied in another work [16] , the deposition rate onto patterned substrate was measured to be 2-fold lower. A possible explanation for the TDMASb pre-treatment advantage when using patterned substrates can be attributed to a surface chemistry effect, since the tendency of the Sb and Te precursors not to readily decompose on dielectrics, but to efficiently decompose on metal surfaces (such as TiN, W) was observed in the absence of a reactive gas [18] . As for the planar substrates, Kim et al. proposed Ge films that were deposited on TiAlN/SiO2 /Si by MOCVD, through the catalyst effect of the Sb metal decomposed from the Sb(iPr)3  precursor [19]  and we reported that the GST coverage on SiO2  is improved by (TDMAGe + TDMASb) pre-treatment [7] . Last, it is conceivable that the contemporary presence of In and Sb precursors during the pre-treatment is less effective in improving the precursor decomposition than the TDMASb precursor alone. The XRD patterns of the samples deposited at different temperatures and pressures are displayed in Fig. 4  . In samples deposited at temperatures below 270 °C, the amorphous phase was identified together with the In(Sb0.9 Te0.1 ) cubic phase. An increase of the crystallized fraction and the development of new phases were clearly observed in samples deposited at higher temperatures (350 °C). The In4 Te3  tetragonal phase is identified in samples deposited at higher temperature and its fraction increased with the working pressure. After annealing at 350 °C, the In4 Te3  structure was found also to develop in samples grown at 260 °C. The composition of the grown samples as a function of temperature in the (220 ÷ 350) °C range was analysed by TXRF, as shown in Fig. 5  . The TXRF analysis demonstrated that the deposited material is formed by different In–Sb–Te alloys. Apart from background peaks due to the environment contribution (Ar, Cr, Fe, Cu), the In, Sb and Te peaks are visible, along with the Si peak, coming from the substrate. The calculated chemical composition of samples grown at 350 °C deposition temperature was In3 Sb0.6 Te1.9  close to the stable stoichiometric In3 Sb1 Te2  ternary phase. However, when decreasing the deposition temperature below TC  , the Te content decreases, while the Sb increases. Indeed, the measured chemical composition for samples deposited at 260 °C was In3 Sb2.8 Te0.8 . In particular, it is evident how the Te peaks show a decreasing intensity with decreasing the deposition temperature. The resistivity value of the samples was measured by means of the 4-probe van der Pauw  technique as a function of temperature and is closely related to their crystallinity. A comparison between our results and those reported for other In-based chalcogenides is shown in Fig. 6  [15,20,21] . As discussed previously, due to the deposition conditions, the as-grown IST layers were partially crystallized, that made not possible to detect their crystallization temperature. However, it was found that all the obtained IST compounds exhibit a semiconductor-like behaviour and the post-annealing resistivity decreases by 1/2 to 1 orders of magnitude, with respect to the as-deposited state. Note that the decrease of resistivity which occurs from RT to 400 °C is too narrow to be related to a phase-change phenomenon. Indeed, it indicates the growth of the crystallite size, which triggers the crystallization of the amorphous phase in the sample grown at 260 °C. Instead, the other sharper drop occurring at ≈ 425 °C might indicate a transition toward a different arrangement and phase formation. However, the resistivity data are not available above this temperature, due to the evaporation of the material, which starts at temperatures > 400 °C (the measurement is carried out in a vacuum condition of 10− 3  Pa which lowers the evaporation temperature of IST). Nevertheless, the formation of the ternary IST phase occurs between 400 and 450 °C, as reported in [22] . Therefore, the observed drop in resistivity might be the result of the onset of this other transition and could be attributed to the formation of a different phase or phases. The resistivity values were measured in the range from ≈ 1 Ω cm (at RT) to some tens of mΩ cm at or above 430 °C. These values are higher than those reported for the crystalline In3 Sb1 Te2  phase (a few mΩ cm) [20] , which might be ascribed to both the separation of the In4 Te3  phase and the crystallization into the InSb0.9 Te0.1  structure, observed in all the as-grown samples. The binary In4 Te3  compound is highly resistive (~ 1 Ω cm at RT) [23]  and is thought to have a dominant effect on the film resistivity. Its formation was detected by XRD analysis both in the as-grown samples and in the samples thermally annealed up to 350 °C, as mentioned before (see Fig. 4 ). As shown in Fig. 6 , the IST resistivity values reported in literature span over a broad range, hence suggesting a very strong effect of the deposition conditions, chemical composition and film thickness on the electrical properties of the material. In this regard, the TDMASb pre-treatment (at 260 °C), despite improving the conformality, has a detrimental effect on the resistivity, which increases by a factor of three from 0.32 to 0.98 Ω cm (after thermal annealing). Differently from the Ge–Sb–Te compounds, the film thickness is thought to play a role in In3 Sb1 Te2  thin films, which is relevant to their implementation into PCM devices. As reported by Manivannan et al., both resistivity and crystallization temperature are inversely proportional to the film thickness [20] . According to this, we considered two samples grown in the same conditions with the TDMASb pre-treatment and thickness 100 and 44 nm (green and blue plot in Fig. 6 , respectively). Among all the samples investigated in this work, the thickest film exhibited the lowest resistivity, both before and after annealing. Our results agree with those reported in the literature. The thickness dependence of the electrical resistivity of In-based chalcogenides should be considered in view of their implementation in sub-20 nm devices.  4 Conclusions In this work the MOCVD deposition of IST-based chalcogenide films was demonstrated at different deposition temperatures. Samples grown at 260 °C exhibited compact thin layer morphology and consisted of crystalline and partially amorphous phases. On the other hand, the samples grown at 350 °C showed nanostructured features and an increase of the crystallized fraction, as well as the development of In–Te related phases. The IST films grown with TDMASb pre-treatment resulted in the formation of a conformal and smoother morphology, with 50% improved surface roughness for the same layer thickness. In this regard, the TDMASb pre-treatment was found to increase the electrical conductivity of the IST film by a factor of three in comparison to the untreated film. Finally, the electrical resistivity was found to increase when the layer thickness was scaled from 100 to 44 nm.

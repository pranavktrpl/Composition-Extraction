Title: Modeling of the TL response of K2YF5 for different concentrations of Tb3+ ions

Abstract: In this work we simulated the concentration quenching (CQ) of the thermoluminescence glow peaks of K2YF5 single crystals doped with different concentrations of Tb3+ ions, for samples irradiated with a 137Cs gamma source. A physical model used in this study, consisting of three trapping states and one kind of recombination center, has been assumed and the set of differential equations have been integrated without additional approximations. The parameters employed in the simulation have been estimated by previous glow curve deconvolution employing the general order kinetic (GOK) model. The model succeeds to predict the behavior of the areas under glow peaks as function of Tb3+ ions concentrations, confirming that the proposed model provides a good explanation of the concentration quenching phenomena.

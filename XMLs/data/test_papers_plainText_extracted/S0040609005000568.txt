Title: Excimer laser induced crystallization of amorphous silicon on flexible polymer substrates

Abstract: Laser crystallization of a-Si:H on PES, PET and AryLite™ polymer substrates is reported. For each material, the glass transition temperature T                      g and the coefficient of thermal expansion have been evaluated, to determine the optimum deposition and crystallization processes conditions. 1000-Å thick intrinsic amorphous silicon films have been deposited on the substrates by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition in the temperature range of 120–250°C. Dehydrogenation and crystallization have been obtained by high energy (10 J) XeCl pulsed excimer laser. The irradiation conditions have been varied to study their influence on the electrical and optical properties of crystallized material. Structural characterization has been performed by X-ray Diffraction. Increasing the radiation energy densities up to 220 mJ/cm2 crystallites sizes up to 750 Å have been obtained.

Experimental:
The crystallization process has been performed by a high energy excimer laser (XeCl at 308 nm) “Hercules-L”, a prototype laser completely designed by ENEA, with a maximum energy output of 10 J, a pulse width of 120 ns and a maximum repetition rate of 10 Hz. The beam spot size is 100 mm×70 mm. The samples, irradiated in air at room temperature, have been placed on a computer controlled X-table, with a position accuracy of 1 μm, to obtain a uniform irradiation along the whole surface.

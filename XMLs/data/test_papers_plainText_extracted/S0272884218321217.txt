Title: Ultra-stable X9R type CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 ceramics

Abstract: CaCu3-xZnxTi4.1O12 (x = 0.00, 0.05 and 0.10) precursor powders were prepared by the polymer pyrolysis (PP) solution method. Ultra-stable X9R type capacitor with very low loss tangent (tanδ) ~0.017 varied within a value of less than 0.05 in a wide temperature range of −60 to 150 °C and high dielectric constants (ε                      ′) ~9200 with Δε′ ≤ ± 15% in a wide temperature range of −60 to 210 °C was achieved in CaCu2.95Zn0.05Ti4.1O12 (Zn05-1) ceramic obtained by sintering the precursor powder (x = 0.05) at 1060 °C for 8 h. A major role for the validity of ε                      ′ and tanδ in these wider temperature ranges was suggested to originated from the very high grain boundary resistance (R                                               gb                       ~413,190 Ω cm), resulting from the effect of Zn2+ doping and TiO2-rich at grain boundary. With the excellent dielectric properties of (Zn05-1) ceramic, it was suggested to be applied for X8R and X9R capacitors. Interestingly, improvements of nonlinear properties with very high nonlinear coefficient (α ~ 25.94) and breakdown field (E                                               b                      ~ 3146.25 V.cm−1) values were achieved in (Zn05-1) ceramic, as well.

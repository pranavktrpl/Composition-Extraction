Title: Thermal diffused post-selenization for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of thermally evaporated Sb2Se3 solar cell

Abstract: Sb2Se3 is a promising absorber material for photovoltaic applications owing to its suitable bandgap and high absorption coefficient. However, the initial deposition of the precursor Sb2Se3 thin films using thermal evaporation with an annealing process, results in poor crystallinity and inadequate Se content, leading to significantly low device efficiency and some deep-level detrimental defects. To address these issues, herein, we propose a facile thermal diffusion post-selenization method to supplement Se into post-deposited Sb2Se3 thin films. This process not only achieves stoichiometric composition but also improves the crystallinity of the samples, thereby reducing defect density and carrier recombination. As a result, the efficiency of the fabricated Mo/Sb2Se3/CdS/ITO/Ag solar cell is significantly enhanced from 0.66% to 3.29%.

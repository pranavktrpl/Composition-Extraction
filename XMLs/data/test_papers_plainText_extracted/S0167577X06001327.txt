Title: Structure and properties of the ordered double perovskites Sr2MWO6 (M=Co  Ni) by sol-gel route

Abstract: The single-phase double perovskites Sr2MWO6 (M=Co, Ni) were prepared by sol-gel method. Crystal Structure, magnetic properties and the morphology of Sr2CoWO6 and Sr2NiWO6 were investigated. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis shows single phase structure for Sr2MWO6 (M=Co, Ni) without any traces of impurities and the crystal structure of all the samples belongs to the tetragonal I4/m space group. SEM image for Sr2MWO6 (M=Co, Ni) indicate that the grains are homogeneous and connect each other very well. The Neel temperature for Sr2CoWO6 and Sr2NiWO6 are 23 K and 59 K, respectively. Magnetic measurements showed that the magnetic moment in these double perovskites originates mainly from the interactions between Ni ions and Co ions.

Experimental:
The X-ray diffraction measurement (XRD) was performed using a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer with Cu KÎ± radiation. The magnetization was measured in zero field at 1 T on an Oxford MagLab equipment, in the range 5 K to 300 K. The morphology of grains was characterized by a JE01 JXA-840 scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The elements valences were investigated by an ESCALABMKII X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

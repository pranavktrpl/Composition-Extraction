Title: Influence of deposition temperature on microstructure and electrical properties of modified (Ba  Sr)TiO3 ferroelectric thin films

Abstract: Modified Ba0.67Sr0.33TiO3 (BST) thin films were deposited on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates using RF magnetron sputtering. By optimizing the deposition temperature (T                                               d                      ), the dielectric and ferroelectric properties of BST films were improved. The onset of crystallization of the BST films was observed at about 600°C, beyond which there was an increase in grain size with further increasing T                                               d                       up to 700°C. The better crystallized film deposited at 700°C with a thickness of 670nm shows a polycrystalline and dense structure, a dielectric constant (                                                                                    ε                                                                                       r                                                                           )=953.40 (at 100kHz), and a remanent polarization (2P                                               r                      )=23.87μC/cm2. The dielectric tunability at 1MHz increases as T                                               d                       increases, and reaches the highest value of 55.40% for an applied field of 770kV/cm at the highest T                                               d                       of 700°C. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electric performance analysis also indicate that the deposition temperature during growth strongly affects the microstructure of BST films. This in turn influences the dielectric, ferroelectric and tunable behavior of BST films.

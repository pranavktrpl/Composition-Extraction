Title: Synthesis  structural  optical  electrical and thermoluminescence properties of chemically deposited PbS thin films

Abstract: PbS thin films with deposition times of 100, 115, 130 and 145min were prepared by chemical bath deposition method at room temperature. Their crystal structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction. All films were polycrystalline with a cubic rock salt structure. The morphological properties of the films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The optical properties of the films were studied using the absorbance, transmittance and reflectance spectra. The optical band gap of the films decreased from 2.65eV to 2.50eV with increasing deposition time. The optical parameters of the materials such as refractive index, extinction coefficient and dielectric constants were also determined. The electrical conductivity of the PbS film increased from 1.791×10−6 to 1.655×10−3                      (Ωcm)−1 with increasing deposition time. Thermoluminescence intensity of the films was measured after irradiating the films with a β source for 15min at room temperature and the kinetic parameters were obtained by using the computer glow curve deconvolution method.

Introduction:
There have been many attempts to understand structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of PbS thin films. However, the thermoluminescence (TL) method, which is widely used for the investigation of the charge carrier traps in materials, has not been applied for these films, yet. Moreover, size effects on the luminescence properties of PbS films remain an open research area.

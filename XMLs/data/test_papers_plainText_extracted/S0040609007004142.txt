Title: Disorder  band offsets and dopability of transparent conducting oxides

Abstract: N-type transparent conducting oxides are based on ionic oxides with s-like cation conduction bands. The effect of disorder on their conduction band states is found to be small, because angular disorder has no effect on s states. Aliovalent impurities give rise to shallow states at the conduction band, which leads to an absence of a conduction band tail of localized states. This leads to a higher electron mobility than in typical p state amorphous materials like a-Si, the ability to move the Fermi level well into the conduction band and an absence of electrical instability as in a-Si:H. The band offsets are used to suggest appropriate oxide dielectrics for their thin transistors.

Limits to doping:
Three requirements must be met to observe doping, the impurity must be soluble, it must be shallow and it must not be compensated by native defects of the opposite charge. Compensation is the most fundamental limitation.

Title: Calculation and experimental characterization of the defect physics in CuInSe2

Abstract: Numerical simulations of the defect distribution of CuInSe2 were carried out as a function of the stoichiometry. The simulations are based on a new calculation of the intrinsic defects in this material. The results of the calculations were compared with earlier electrical and positron lifetime measurements. This leads to the assumption, that the single defects VSe, VCu, CuIn and the defect pair (2VCuâ€“InCu) occur in the investigated specimens in considerable concentrations.

Title: Hydrothermal synthesis and crystal structure of a novel two-dimensional organic–inorganic hybrid copper molybdate with mixed organodiamine and dicarboxyl ligands

Abstract: An unusual compound, [{Cu(2,2′–bpy)}2(tp)Mo4O13] (tp=terephthalate) 1, has been hydrothermally synthesized and structurally characterized by the elemental analyses, IR spectrum, X-ray photoelectron spectrum, TG analyses and the single crystal X-ray diffraction. The structure of 1 exhibits a layered network built up from bimetallic one-dimensional ribbons bridged by dicarboxylate ligands. Compound 1 represents the first hybrid molybdates composed of mixed organodiamine and dicarboxylate ligands. Crystal data for compound 1: triclinic, space group P                            1                            ̄                                               , a=7.3748(15)Å, b=9.9692(2)Å, c=12.0692(2)Å, α=69.223(3)°, β=76.123(3)°, γ=76.623(3)°; V=794.83(3)Å3; Z=1, R (final)=0.0688. The data were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID IP diffractometer at 293K using graphite-monochromated MoKα radiation (λ=0.71073Å) and oscillation scans technique in the range 1.83°<θ<27.48°.

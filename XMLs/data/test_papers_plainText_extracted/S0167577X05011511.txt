Title: Synthesis and characterization of fluorinated poly(aryl ether ether ketone)s terminated with a phenylethynyl group

Abstract: Crosslinkable fluorinated poly(aryl ether ether ketone)s (3F-PEEKn-PEP) bearing phenylethynyl moieties were synthesized via the polymerization of (3-trifluoromethyl) phenyl hydroquinone with an excess 4,4′-difluorobenzophenone, followed by the reaction of 4-phenylethynyl phenol. They could be processed during their precursor forms by solution casting method. The cured polymers showed higher glass transition temperatures, good chemical resistance, and high thermal stability after thermal treatment at 360 °C for 2 h. The cured films had no obvious absorptions at the wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55 μm.

Preparation of crosslinked 3F-PEEKn-PEP films:
3F-PEEKn-PEP in precursor form was dissolved into cyclohexanone at concentration of 30 wt.%. Then the solution was filtered with a syringe through a 0.2-mm Teflon membrane filter. The filtered solution was coated on microscope slides, gradually increased temperature to volatilize solvent, and then cured at 360 °C for 2 h under a vacuum. The transparent and flexible films in cured forms were obtained.

Conclusion:
A series of cross-linkable fluorinated poly(aryl ether ether ketone) oligomers have been successfully synthesized in a two-step synthetic route. The flexible films could be prepared by solution casting of the precursors, and then curing at 360 °C. The cross-linked polymer offered highly thermal stability, higher glass transition temperature, and good solvent resistance. They showed small optical absorptions at 1.3 and 1.55 μm.

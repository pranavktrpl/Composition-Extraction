Title: Rapid sintering method for highly conductive Li7La3Zr2O12 ceramic electrolyte

Abstract: Solid electrolytes could address the increasingly urgent safety and energy density concerns of lithium-ion batteries. Among several kinds of solid electrolytes, Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (Ta-LLZO) became a research hotspot because of its high Li-ion conductivity and chemical stability against Li-metal and air. However, the preparation of high quality LLZO ceramic electrolyte via conventional air ambient sintering method is still a big challenge due to the serious “Li-loss” and abnormal grain growth phenomenon during the long-time high-temperature sintering process. Herein, a new rapid ultra-high-temperature air ambient sintering method without mother powder (MP) is put forward for the preparation of high quality Ta-LLZO ceramic electrolyte. The rapid sintering strategy can effectively restrain “Li-loss”. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the none-mother-powder method is superior to traditional mother-powder method. Ta-LLZO ceramics sintered without MP via this rapid sintering method own small grain size, tight grain boundary, dense microstructure and high conductivity. Specifically, the Ta-LLZO ceramic sintered at 1360 °C for 10 min without MP exhibits high conductivity (8.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C) and high relative density (97%), which equate those made by hot pressing sintering method. Without MP, the sintering process can avoid a lot of material waste and simplify the operation process. Moreover, the rapid sintering process can sharply shorten sintering time and reduce energy consumption. Therefore, this low-cost high-efficient sintering strategy can be effectively used in the large-scale production of high-quality Ta-LLZO ceramic electrolyte.

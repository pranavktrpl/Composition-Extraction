Title: Experimental investigation of radioactivity induced in the fusion power plant structural material in Eurofer and in other steels by D–T neutrons

Abstract: The low-activation steel Eurofer was irradiated with D–T fusion neutrons. The radioactivity following irradiation was determined several times during decay by γ-spectroscopy. The results were analysed with the European Activation System (EASY-99). Ratios of calculated-to-experimental values for individual activities and for their sums are discussed in connection with the expected low-activation behaviour of the material in fusion power plant conditions.

Introduction:
The spectrum of the neutron flux in a fusion device consists of two parts, a D–T fusion peak at 14 MeV and a continuum ranging down to thermal energies. The radioactivity is mainly produced at 14 MeV neutron energy, where the number of open reaction channels is a maximum, and at thermal neutron energy, where cross-section values are large. In the present work, the radioactivity induced by 14 MeV neutrons in Eurofer was investigated.

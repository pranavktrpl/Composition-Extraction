Title: Coupling between JET pedestal ne
               –Te
                and outer target plate recycling

Abstract: Systematic scans using D2 gas puffing and impurity-seeding (Ne, N2) have been carried out on ELMy-H and Advanced-Tokamak-like discharges to study power deposition amelioration at the divertor target plates in preparation for the JET ITER-Like Wall (ILW). Hereby it has been discovered that the recycling ion fluxes I                      div to the outer target plate exhibit a clear connection to pedestal ne                       and Te, whereby the Dα photon flux Φ                      Dα from the outer divertor serves here as an approximate measure of I                      div. Φ                      Dα can be expressed as (ne                      /Te                      )                         β                       with β                      =2.5/3 depending on the scenario (EH/AT). This coupling between SOL and pedestal across the edge transport barrier (ETB) is associated with a close connection between ne                       and Te                       in the ETB over the entire range of operational parameters, with the slope of log                      Te                       vs. log                      ne                       being ∼0.9/1.24 for ET/AT scenarios, respectively.

Title: Crystal structure and charge transfer energy of the vaterite-type orthoborate YBO3:Eu

Abstract: Ligand-to-metal charge transfer energies of YBO3:Eu have been investigated from the chemical bond viewpoint. The chemical bond parameters, such as the covalency, the polarizability of the chemical bond volume, and the presented charge of the ligands in the chemical bond have been quantitatively determined based on the dielectric theory of complex crystal. We calculated the environmental factor (h                      e), which is the major factor influencing the charge transfer energy in the compounds. The calculated results show that the suitable group space of YBO3 is C2/c. The method provides us with a supplementary tool to judge the proper structure when the structure of the crystal has many uncertain space groups.

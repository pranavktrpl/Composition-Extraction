Title: Pursuit of stability  electronic and thermoelectric properties of novel PdVGa half heusler compound

Abstract: In this work, we have explored structural, electronic, and thermoelectric properties of novel PdVGa half Heusler compound. PdVGa is chemically, mechanically, dynamically stable and a direct bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.012 eV. At 300 K, the maximum value of Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and lattice thermal conductivity are 763 μV/K, 28.61                                                      ×                                                           10                               4                                                                            S/m and 4.60 W/mK respectively. The computed value of ZT is 0.048 at 700 K. This compound has been designed as a thermoelectric material for the first time, and it may be useful in thermoelectric material experimental research.

Conclusion:
We investigate structural, electronic, and thermoelectric properties of PdVGa using density functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory. We found that this material has semiconducting nature with a direct bandgap of 1.012 eV. Elastic properties confirm the mechanical stability and ductile nature. PdVGa compound has the lowest lattice thermal conductivity due to lattice scattering and is equal to 4.60 W/mK at 300 K. We found that ZT = 0.048 for PdVGa half Heusler compound at 700 K.
